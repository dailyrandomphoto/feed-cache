According to Cherlynn Low, iPhone users have a lot to look forward to later this year. Meanwhile, Nicole Lee set up both the 8- and 5-inch Echo Shows in her house to check out Amazon’s updates, and she says the Echo Show 8 is now much improved for video calls. Also, Daniel Cooper found a lot to like about the Lenovo Legion 5, but he admits the laptop comes with some compromises.</p><h2>There’s a lot to explore in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">the public beta of iOS 15</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/60f3f930-e0e0-11eb-a7f7-3812ce1e1d41" alt="iOS 15 beta" data-uuid="afd3c4c6-c374-3a05-9c8c-75aa2dcf2299"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>After spending a few weeks testing the latest iOS 15 features, including SharePlay and Focus modes, Cherlynn Low concluded that Apple lovers will have a bunch of new things to try out this fall. As most of the changes are already available, it’s perhaps not surprising that the beta is fairly complete. While testing SharePlay, Cherlynn encountered a few minor glitches. It was difficult to figure out how to access the feature initially because the options only show up when a compatible media app is open during a chat. And both parties will need a subscription to stream together on Apple TV+ or Apple Music.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cherlynn particularly liked the Focus modes, which let users create customized profiles that only allow notifications from selected apps or people to come through. You can also pick a Home screen that will only show the apps you want. In this mode, you won’t see any other pages — just the apps drawer and the Today screen — keeping distractions to a minimum.</p><p>Other upgrades include Live Text, which scans photos for usable text like foreign words on a menu to translate; richer and more detailed Maps; better Spotlight search and Share With You, which consolidates media your friends send you. Cherlynn said there’s much more to explore in the Weather, Safari and Wallet apps that should give fans a taste of the full release. She also spent time with the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8 beta</a>, which brings more health and fitness tools, improved communication and better integration with connected appliances to the Apple Watch.</p><h2>Amazon&#39;s latest Echo Shows are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">pretty familiar, and that&#39;s ok</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5c58910-e0e0-11eb-bfbf-28b50b7ef173" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8 and Show 5" data-uuid="a99896b2-dda6-335f-9614-b86c01d71294"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicole Lee/Engadget</div></figure><p>Amazon didn’t change much on the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3xnC7Xe">$129 Echo Show 8</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Show 5" href="https://amzn.to/3iM7V3S">$85 Show 5</a>, and Nicole Lee says that’s just fine. The two devices eschew the swiveling screen found in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 10" href="https://amzn.to/3ww1oOe">Echo Show 10</a> and keep much of what worked in previous models: the minimalist design, an ambient light sensor to adjust brightness and color temperature and a camera shutter for privacy. The Echo Show 8 has a 1,280 x 800 resolution display while the Show 5 features a 960 x 480 screen, and the latter is clearly intended as more of a nightstand device. Nicole was particularly pleased by the sound quality on the Echo Show 8, which delivered powerful bass and impressive volume.</p><p>And because it now features an octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera, the Echo Show 8 is now more useful for video calls. The camera also has digital panning and zooming technology so it can follow you during video calls, although in Nicole’s experience, this took a few seconds to kick in. But the Show 8 won’t be best for all your video needs as it lacks native YouTube as well as streaming support for Disney+, Paramount+ and HBO Max. If you’re already in the Amazon ecosystem, she says the Echo Show 8 delivers the most value for the money — but if you’re looking for something akin to an alarm clock, the Show 5 is a better choice.</p><h2>Lenovo&#39;s Legion 5 Pro is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html">affordable gaming laptop with great graphics</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="a73b2c79-761d-341a-a190-be99f577b6e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Though Lenovo isn’t best known for its gaming laptops, Daniel Cooper points out that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Legion 5 Pro" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=buyersguide2021&amp;subId3=Review-LenovoLegion5Pro&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-0-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H-16GB-512GB-NVMe-TLC-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-Windows-10-Home-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645%3F">Legion 5 Pro</a> laptop is clearly trying to capture more of that attention. With AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H and NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 graphics, the machine is powerful — and at $1,530, it’s relatively affordable as well. Daniel points out that the 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD are underwhelming, but they can be upgraded, and the 16-inch, 165Hz QHD IPS display holds its own in bright light and reduces glare.</p><p>When it comes to design, users get a solid aluminum chassis with a professional looking matte grey paint job, plus a plethora of ports including four USB-A, two USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Daniel said that typing on Lenovo’s TrueStrike keyboard is a unique experience: the “soft landing” switches makes each actuation feel a bit deeper than the keys 1.5mm depth. He was less fond of the 720p webcam, which produces fuzzy images with light blooms, and the heat produced by the fan system was noticeable. However, the big compromise on the Legion 5 is the battery life — the machine lasted only 4 hours and 43 minutes during testing, which makes it most useful when near an outlet.</p><h2>The Fitbit Luxe is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-review-small-fitness-tracker-150008620.html">impressively small fitness tracker</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c6fe7e10-e0e2-11eb-b95f-740ff4305eb3" alt="Fitbit Luxe" data-uuid="3adb2a25-82e7-37c5-acdb-c1f27b3a895f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low acknowledges that designing a stylish fitness tracker is difficult.

Measuring 0.4 x 1.43 inches, the Luxe manages to include a heart rate sensor, oxygen saturation monitoring, sleep tracking, water resistance and basic phone syncing all in its tiny frame.</p><p>However, the downside is that small footprint results in a tiny screen as well. The 0.76-inch AMOLED panel, which runs at a 124 x 206 resolution, is hard to read. Cherlynn said that the text showing workout stats, cardio zone information and notifications might be frustratingly small for some. That aside, she had no problem using the Luxe to track workouts and sleep data; it works as promised and the UI is similar to other Fitbit devices without physical buttons. The touchscreen was responsive and she was able to get seven days of battery life — and that was even with connected GPS turned on for a bit. Overall, Cherlynn calls the Luxe well-made and capable, but best for those looking for a petite tracker.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-spend-some-time-with-the-apple-ios-15-beta-160009850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d310d1cb-3620-47c2-8c6b-c5dbe19a3940</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625859876</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T19:44:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An iPhone XR laying on a white surface showing "What's new in iOS 15" on its screen.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 beta ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How NASA selected the first Lunar Rover to scoot across the moon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The concept of space travel was so new to us that when President Kennedy issued his famous moonshot speech, not even NASA&#39;s top scientists were completely sure we could actually land on the lunar surface.

Sure enough, come summer, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory laid out its requirements for a hundred-pound, remote-controlled rover that it wanted to stash aboard the landers. The vehicle would explore the lurrain up to a mile from the Surveyors, while its drivers back on Earth steered it with television eyes. The laboratory alerted companies planning to bid on the phase 1 design study—the normal first stage of any new hardware program—that they’d be expected to supply engineering models of their concepts. Proposals were due in seven weeks.</p><p>The short deadline weeded out the dilettantes. In October the two companies left standing—GM and Bendix—started work under contract. GM was ready with its six-wheeled design. Its Surveyor lunar roving vehicle was six feet long on eighteen-inch wheels and weighed ninety pounds—half the size and half again as heavy as its test bed, with a sure-footedness that was no less jaw-dropping. On Pavlics’s “lunarium” of rocks, craters, and slopes outside the Santa Barbara lab, it climbed forty-five-degree inclines, leapt twenty-inch crevasses, and bent its way up and over thirty-inch steps.</p><p>Bekker and Pavlics had been working on the idea for more than three years by then. Their main advancement this time: the wheels. Again, they were made of wire, but it was knotted into a wide mesh that resembled chain-link, and shaped into fat doughnuts. Like the team’s earlier wire tires, they deflected when they hit an obstacle and absorbed some of the bumps of cross-country travel. They worked with or without a fabric covering.</p><p>“We had a big program to try to come up with the wire material that would survive the vacuum environment on the moon,” John Calandro recalled. “Frank had devised a testing device that created the vacuum environment we needed.”</p><p>When fully geared up for a mission, the rover would be an electronic wonder, with subsystems supplied by RCA Astro-Electronics and by AC Electronics, a GM division in Milwaukee: it would have a stereo TV imaging rig, sophisticated navigation and control, and silver-zinc batteries recharged by solar panel. But Santa Barbara’s part of the job, the vehicle itself, was a study in doing more with less. The hardware was constantly “assessed to see if something simpler might be able to do the same job,” designer Norman J. James would remember. “‘The part that’s left off never breaks’ was an often-repeated phrase.”</p><p>Bendix took a radically different approach. Its SLRV was a squarish, two-part, articulated robot, with curving, shock-absorbing legs at its corners that ended in small caterpillar track assemblies. The tracks pitched independently to follow uneven ground. Its handlers steered it with commands to slow, speed up, or reverse the tracks on one side or the other, and the pivot linking the two halves did the rest. On the moon, it would be powered by a radioisotope thermal generator—a small nuclear device—hanging off the back, and bristle with scientific instruments and antennas. It weighed one hundred pounds.</p><p>Side by side with the GM model, the Bendix machine looked bulky and awkward, and those tiny tracks didn’t seem much of a match for Pavlics’s nearly spherical wire wheels. But Bendix was bullish on its design right up to the day in May 1964 when a panel from the U.S. Geological Survey, Caltech, and NASA took the two models to a volcanic field north of Flagstaff, Arizona, and turned them loose on the rugged Bonito Lava Flow. “We had one little section where they could really get into some pretty rough stuff,” the Geological Survey’s Jack McCauley recalled years later. “The GM vehicle was perfect. It got from point A to point B without any mishaps or turning over.</p><p>“The poor Bendix vehicle had tanklike treads that were made of some kind of rubber-type thing,” McCauley said. “The vehicle just started shredding the treads. In fact, when they finished halfway down the course, it had no treads left. So, the GM thing obviously got our blessing.”</p><p>General Motors had scored a decisive victory. Unfortunately, it didn’t add up to a rover on the moon. The “Rover Boys,” as that panel of testers came to be known, were mightily impressed with the six-wheeler, but its capabilities didn’t square with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s requirements: namely, to “go around and take pictures every ten meters, and also to use a penetrometer to see what the strength of the lunar soil was—and to do it in a preordained manner,” McCauley said. “Basically, just do a grid survey.” Bendix had produced too little rover for the mission; GM had produced too much. The Rover Boys reluctantly reported that neither rover matched the Surveyor program’s stated needs, and that was among the reasons that NASA scrubbed the rover component not long after.</p><p>By that time, JPL’s Ranger program had finally given NASA its first close looks at the moon. By design, they were fleeting glimpses: Ranger probes crashed into the lunar surface while taking high-resolution photos right up to the moment of impact. Conceived in 1959, the program had, at times, seemed another exercise in frustration. After Rangers 1 and 2 made two development test voyages in 1961, along came Rangers 3 through 6, all of which were busts. It wasn’t until July 1964, and Ranger 7, that the program literally hit pay dirt. As the spacecraft fell toward the moon, its cameras kicked on, and, for some seventeen minutes, it took and transmitted photographs of the approaching surface—4,316 images in all, some of them at a resolution hundreds of times greater than the best taken from Earth. The photos didn’t put to rest the fears inspired by Thomas Gold’s writings and lectures, but they did establish that the maria were smooth enough for a landing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-across-the-airless-wilds-earl-smith-custom-house-153003777.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9dc9a7ae-cab1-4fea-905f-5bc22f813de6</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 15:30:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625847054</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T16:11:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/71113b60-a8c1-11e9-be7f-e34e26b0b59e" width="7449" height="5168" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/71113b60-a8c1-11e9-be7f-e34e26b0b59e" width="7449" height="5168" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA NASA / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Astronaut John W.

If you ask rival company Blue Origin, though, Branson won&#39;t really be reaching space when he does. In a couple of <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001">tweets</a>, the Jeff Bezos-owned space corporation compared what its own New Shepard suborbital vehicle can do with SpaceShipTwo&#39;s capabilities.

The company says New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line, whereas its competitor&#39;s vehicle was not.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kármán line is the boundary between the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and outer space as set by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. It&#39;s defined as 100 kilometers or 62 miles above sea level, and according to Blue Origin, it&#39;s what &quot;96 percent of the world&#39;s population&quot; recognizes as the beginning of outer space. Blue Origin plans to offer customers 10 minutes of flight with an altitude that reaches the Kármán line. Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic&#39;s <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/">website</a> says its flights will soar at &quot;nearly&quot; 300,000 feet (57 miles) in altitude. That doesn&#39;t quite reach the Kármán line, though that&#39;s still higher than what NASA and the US government defines as the beginning of space (50 miles above sea level).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7bb2074d97154b968af2e3d3804fdc31"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Only 4% of the world recognizes a lower limit of 80 km or 50 miles as the beginning of space.

For the past year, the service has been testing and tweaking systems to find and take down such content. It will <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety"><ins>roll out those systems</ins></a> in the US and Canada over the next few weeks.</p><p>To start with, the algorithms will <a href="https://www.axios.com/tiktok-automation-video-removals-5388a03a-4625-4435-9311-ede21fafc148.html"><ins>be on the lookout</ins></a> for posts that violate policies related to the safety of minors, violence, graphic content, nudity, sex, illegal activity and regulated goods. If the systems detect a violation, they&#39;ll yank the video immediately and the user who posted it can appeal. Users can still flag videos for manual review as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Automated reviews will be &quot;reserved for content categories where our technology has the highest degree of accuracy,&quot; TikTok said. Only one in 20 of the videos that have been automatically removed were false positives and should have remained on the platform, according to the company. TikTok hopes to improve the algorithms&#39; accuracy levels and notes that &quot;requests to appeal a video&#39;s removal have remained consistent.&quot;</p><p>TikTok says automation should free up its safety staff to focus on content that requires a more nuanced approach, including videos containing bullying, harassment, misinformation and hate speech. Crucially, the systems could reduce the number of potentially distressing videos that the safety team have to watch, such as those containing extreme violence or child exploitation. Facebook, for one, has been accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ireland-content-moderators-183059300.html"><ins>not doing enough</ins></a> to protect the wellbeing and mental health of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-lawsuit-settlement-212601146.html"><ins>content moderators</ins></a> who are tasked with reviewing often-disturbing content.</p><p>Elsewhere, TikTok is changing how it notifies users after they&#39;re caught breaking rules. The platform now tracks the number, severity and frequency of violations. Users will see details about those in the account updates section of their inbox. They can also view information about the consequences of their actions, such as how long they&#39;re suspended from posting or engaging with anyone else&#39;s content.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-automatic-content-removal-violence-nudity-171158047.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86aae845-f4b3-4ed7-84a7-a2c64037901a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 17:11:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625849110</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T16:45:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1683b410-f7db-11ea-bdf9-e37c87cf7fe0" width="6022" height="4014" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1683b410-f7db-11ea-bdf9-e37c87cf7fe0" width="6022" height="4014" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The TikTok logo is pictured outside the company's U.S. head office in Culver City, California, U.S.,  September 15, 2020.

The tiny mixers are lightweight, offer bags of connectivity and won’t break the bank. The latest model, the “<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pro-X" href="https://fave.co/3k3zTZI">Pro-X</a>,” brings some modest but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-go-mixer-pro-x-guitar-pedal-mobile-input-mixer-133253000.html">important upgrades</a> from the original <a href="https://www.roland.com/global/products/gomixer_pro/">Go:Mixer Pro</a>.</p><p>The main newness here is less about the audio and more about compatibility: Roland claims the Pro-X adds better support for Android phones and iOS devices. Don’t worry, there <em>is</em> some extra audio functionality. Namely, a new gain “pad” for guitars (to attenuate volume on active pickups) and the headphone/monitor port is now bi-directional (i.e. it’s also an input). Roland pitches the latter as a way to record the inline mic in your headphones, but you can also plug in a lavalier/3.5mm source too, if you can live without monitoring.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The rest of the Pro-X is the same as the Pro before it. There’s a single XLR combi port on the right hand side for microphones and 1/4-inch devices. Also on this side you’ll find the phantom power switch (for when using condenser microphones), a smartphone/line level 3.5mm input and a guitar/bass port. The front edge hosts two more 3.5mm line level inputs, that new pad switch, the updated dual-directional headphone port and the phone loopback switch. The left hand side has just a pair of 1/4-inch instrument inputs and the battery cover for four AAA cells needed for the phantom power.</p><p>In short, if it has, or can be converted to, a 3.5mm port, a quarter-inch jack or an XLR connector you can likely use it here.</p><p>On the top face of the Pro-X is where you’ll find all the gain rotaries for each input. A few things to note though: the “smartphone” 3.5mm input doesn’t have a gain control, you’ll need to adjust that on the phone itself. Although, you can also plug a phone into one of the quarter-inch ports with an adapter, in which case you will have volume control with one of the ports if that’s important. It’s also worth mentioning that the master volume is also the monitor gain which is a little inconvenient if you want high monitoring levels but low gain on your recording or vice versa.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5e036490-e0c2-11eb-bbf5-bedbdac8c380" alt="Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on." data-uuid="ee6e6cd7-c4c7-3898-97ed-073e2ad2bca5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Given that the Pro-X has been designed to work with your phone, there’s a handy ridge along the battery compartment that doubles as a slot for your handset. Obviously this means you don’t need to have your phone lying around like a tethered paperweight, but it also provides a good position for the camera should you wish to livestream a performance. My iPhone 12 with a case doesn’t <em>quite</em> fit in the groove perfectly, but enough that the phone is steady when using it.</p><p>If there’s one immediate thing I would change, it’s the “peak” indicator. Unlike a DJ mixer where you would have a full strip of LEDs indicating the volume of each channel and a separate one for the master volume, the Pro-X has a single LED that will flash red when any input goes over the maximum threshold (i.e. clipping). It’s quite possible to set your levels so that there’s no red light showing during your checks, and then just one plosive can send it over. If there was a way to constantly see how close you are to 0dB that would be much more helpful.</p><p>Worse than that, though, I found that some of my recordings that <em>didn’t</em> trigger the red light could be a little distorted on playback. While speaking into the microphone, everything looked fine, but the recording was often “crunchy” in louder sections. Thankfully, you can actually hear this in your headphones while it’s happening, so you can adjust the levels before hitting record, but ultimately what’s the clipping light for if it’s not reliably preventing you from overdriving things? It made me pretty nervous about each recording until I had experimented with various levels and put more confidence in the monitoring.</p><p>After some testing with different mics, it became clear that dynamic mics are fine, but any condenser I tried needed much more headroom to avoid sounding harsh. It’s not clear whether this is a pre-amp or phantom power issue, or just the extra sensitive nature of condensers. When I tested with a Shure SM59 (dynamic/no phantom power), for example, I was able to — in fact almost had to — set the gain to full, and even if the master volume was at 75 percent there was still plenty of headroom.</p><p>And that brings us back to the fact that the monitor level control is the same as the master gain. You probably want your levels quite modest to make sure you don’t clip, but in doing so, your monitoring levels are also low, making it harder to hear your mix is how you want it, you know, kinda important things.</p><p>I largely avoided this issue by making sure that I was recording into something that showed more detailed levels. Rode’s Reporter app, for example, has a nice, broad meter showing you how hot your signal is and it was much easier to use that as a gauge of the aggregate output.</p><p>Teething problems aside, once you’re all set, it’s all very straightforward. Like I mentioned above, I preferred plugging in a phone (or any other 3.5mm source to be fair) via the Guitar port. Having the rotary dial for volume allows you to adjust the volume on the fly much more fluidly, which is handy if you want to use music beds or other such sources where you might want to dynamically alter the volume.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/865e8230-e0c2-11eb-a9fc-b02c45b08793" alt="Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on." data-uuid="6cba7eab-2a0d-33c0-b384-09e70153d454"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Likewise, if you want to use two XLR microphones — say for a podcast or a vocal and a mic’d instrument) — you can co-opt one of the 3.5mm ports with something like an<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid: iRig Pre 2" href="https://fave.co/3huf5c1"> iRig Pre 2</a>. This means spending out on another bit of gear, but if you record often, having an XLR-to-3.5mm adapter/interface is pretty handy to have around.</p><p>As for that new ability to record with the inline mic on your headphones, all I can say is… it works? Those inline mics are never any good, but it’s never a bad thing to have more inputs, and might work well for more conversational podcasts or just recording phone interviews. As already mentioned, you can actually feed in other inputs here if you don’t need to monitor, say if you’re recording a voice over or something for a multitrack piece you want to edit later.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing, for me, is what <em>else</em> can I use this for? Its credentials as a portable mixer for musicians are obvious. But I also feel like it’s just something handy to have around if you work with audio in any way. I’ve become something of an audio-adapter collector. I have all sorts of cables, interfaces and various types of microphones. Something like the Pro-X appeals to me as a simple way to put lots of those together into a portable setup.</p><p>The wealth of inputs means it’s pretty flexible, too. That’s a pretty compelling combo right there. The levels issue I mentioned earlier is more about learning how to set things up. Once I figured it out it was rarely a problem after that.</p><p>I do wish that the monitor volume was separate from the master volume for those occasions where you really do want to record low but still hear how the mix sounds together. Maybe that’s something we can hope for in a future model.</p><p>Whether you’re a garage band, an artist on the move or a podcaster that likes to get out in the big wide world there’s a lot to like here. At <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$150" href="https://fave.co/3k3zTZI">$150</a>, it’s also a relatively modest investment for something you can easily fit in your back pocket.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rolands-go-mixer-pro-x-studio-in-your-pocket-160021589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5efd2f0-aa6b-488e-a6c5-a2cdfa29ae77</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625851045</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T17:17:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d06a9d10-e0c1-11eb-bebe-bf03a2b6a9b3" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d06a9d10-e0c1-11eb-bebe-bf03a2b6a9b3" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This week's best deals: $30 off Apple's 10.2-inch iPad and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of new tech deals came up across the web this week, plus there are a few July 4th sales that are still going on.

For years, they’ve largely looked the same — plastic or metal rectangles attached to some generic silicone or nylon strap.</p><p>Fitbit likes to say its wearables resemble jewelry. But it’s difficult to make a fitness tracker that <em>actually</em> looks like jewelry and does everything from logging your steps, sleep and workouts to telling you to breathe and relax. The company tried its hand at a stylish fitness band in 2016 with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-18-fitbit-alta-review.html">the Alta</a>, but that device was <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/fitbit-alta,review-3476.html">just a slightly narrower Charge</a> with a finicky screen and has since been discontinued. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-price-specs-available-buy-now-170015159.html">the Luxe</a>, Fitbit is singing a familiar tune, once again promising a “fashion-forward fitness and wellness tracker... in an effortlessly chic bracelet design.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design aside, the Luxe packs almost everything you’d want from a fitness band: a heart rate sensor, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring, sleep tracking, water resistance and basic syncing with your phone. <a href="https://bit.ly/3wvT5Sz">At $150</a>, this could be a great option for those looking for a simple no-frills tracker that stands out from the crowd.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Fitbit’s previous claims about how stylish and chic their trackers are have been questionable. They’re all just rectangular blocks with few minor variations. When announcing the Luxe, the company painstakingly detailed how it crafted the Luxe’s case, saying the device’s “breakthrough design has a soft, gentle shape inspired by the human body that sits lightly on your wrist with a jewelry-like look and feel.”</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f85c46bf-a02b-43c3-9c9c-f64b6ec0beee"/><p>It used techniques like metal injection molding to make the stainless steel case, “providing the warmth expected of handcrafted jewelry, all while delivering a level of precision needed to enable its advanced sensor technology.” After throwing in a few dozen mentions of how elegant the Luxe is, the company ends up calling this “one of Fitbit’s most fashionable and comfortable devices yet.”</p><p>Co-founder James Park said “We’ve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features – some that were previously only available with our smartwatches.” Meaning that Fitbit was able to squeeze advanced components into the teeny tiny body of the Luxe, which is about as wide as my index finger and just 1.43 inches long. It’s indeed very small and thin, with a profile of 0.4 inches. That’s about as thick as the Apple Watch SE, but about a third of the width. It’s also about three quarters as wide as a Fitbit Charge 4, and a <em>hair</em> thinner.</p><p>So yes, the Luxe is a dainty little thing, which is nice for people like me who have small wrists. The stainless steel case itself is slightly curved along the edges, making it less blockish than the Charge 4 and the Alta. But the strap you pick can make all the difference. When paired with the silicone option you get in the box, the Luxe still looks kinda basic. Swap it out for, say, the Gold Mesh version that Fitbit also sent me, and voila! Instant style elevation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca53-e04a-11eb-bfbe-34293ec4dd7b" alt="Slight off angle view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery. The screen shows the time is 6:30pm." data-uuid="3a917e9c-2db0-3ac6-be59-239b2432207f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s nice, but you could make most other fitness trackers look attractive by swapping in a pretty band. Where the Luxe stands out is in its dainty size and narrow width, and that’s good news for those of us who want something smaller. The added bonus of the Luxe’s footprint is that it never got in the way when I was typing or performing a handstand.</p><p>The bad thing about the Luxe’s size is that its screen is correspondingly small. This is a 0.76-inch AMOLED panel running at a 124 x 206 resolution. It’s surrounded by a thick bezel, which is probably hiding all the Luxe’s sensors. But this makes things like your workout stats very hard to read. The screen itself is crisp, bright and colorful. But if you have trouble reading tiny text, you might need a bigger device. Fitbit told Engadget that an update is coming soon that will include larger text, though we still don’t know the specific timeline nor how this will look when it rolls out.</p><h2>Navigation and in use</h2><p>Like the Charge 4 and Sense smartwatch, the Luxe has no physical buttons. But unlike the other two, this tracker doesn’t even have an inductive solid state sensor that detects pressure to trigger an action. The only way you’ll be interacting with the Luxe is through its touchscreen. Thankfully, Fitbit uses a standard one here instead of its faux touchscreen that you had to forcefully jab for it to detect a tap. With the Luxe, you can swipe and tap on the screen just like on any smartwatch, albeit with a very rudimentary OS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca54-e04a-11eb-a6ef-45af42b261f4" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist leaning on a wet railing. The screen is off." data-uuid="29c8f4de-5397-3e5e-b521-cf20b7189d79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Swiping up from the main screen shows your daily progress and battery percentage, while dragging down lets you access Settings and enable Do Not Disturb, Sleep or Water Lock modes. Swiping sideways brings you through Notifications, Exercise, Relax (guided breathing), Alarms and Timers. You can scroll vertically on each of these sections to get to more functions. Double tap the top of the screen to go back (or swipe right). That’s it.</p><p>For more customization, like rearranging your favorite workouts in Exercise, you’ll need to go to the Fitbit app on your phone. By default, you’ll find Walk, Run, Bike, Swim, Treadmill and Workout (a catch-all for almost everything else) here. When you’re exercising, the Luxe will show your calories burned, time elapsed, heart rate and, where relevant, pace or miles covered. That’s far less information than you’ll see at a glance on a bigger screen, but that’s the sacrifice you make for a smaller tracker. You can swipe up to see more things, like a pause button, but that’s about it.</p><p>As you’re working out, too, Fitbit will show your cardio zone below your heart rate, with labels like “fat burn” and “peak.” This is useful information, but again, this is so tiny. I have decent eyesight and even I struggled slightly to read it (and it got harder when I was waving my arms about as I ran).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf07c33-e04a-11eb-bbfc-ec1372367285" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a concrete gray background. The screen shows a run being tracked with a pace of 26:00 and 0.01 miles traveled." data-uuid="136292cc-1ee4-3efc-ae77-d7753aae50e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cramped screen aside, the Luxe behaves like most other basic Fitbit trackers. Though notifications are tedious to read, it’s nice that you can send a quick pre-set reply or emoji from your wrist. The device will also buzz when you’ve been idle too long, or when you’ve achieved your targeted active minutes. When you lift your wrist, the screen wakes up to show you the time (in thankfully large font). If you wear the band to sleep, it’ll use your heart rate to detect what sleep zones you’re in, and after three nights it’ll tell you things like your resting heart rate. If you’ve been running, walking, swimming or biking (or more) for at least 15 minutes, the Luxe will automatically detect and record your activity. You can change that minimum time requirement to something else via the app, too. Unlike the Charge 4, though, the Luxe doesn’t have onboard GPS and will need to connect to your phone to map your outdoor runs.</p><p>Something that’s new since Google completed its acquisition of Fitbit is the introduction of Fast Pair, which works with Android devices. This made setting the Luxe up and syncing it to my Pixel 4a a <em>breeze</em>. I charged up the Luxe, and a window popped up on all my Pixel review units asking if I wanted to connect to the tracker. I tapped yes and before I knew it, I was going through the welcome pages since I already had the Fitbit app installed. This is much easier than the old method of first opening the app, hitting the Add New Device button and then waiting endlessly for my phone to find the wearable.</p><p>There are some other functions that the Luxe offers, but only if you pay the extra $10 a month for Fitbit Premium. The company is throwing in six months free with every purchase, and that gets you additional insight like your activity, heart rate and sleep trends. It’ll also unlock month-long and year-long reports on your wellness, detailed breakdowns on your sleep and stress, as well as guided workouts, mindfulness and nutrition programs. Without the subscription, most people should find the basic data the Luxe gathers is sufficient. But those who are keen on learning about their long term health trends might benefit from Premium.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca50-e04a-11eb-9ef7-e8ebfc6ad464" alt="Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a gold mesh bracelet on a patterned blue and white background.

That’s with tracking multiple workout sessions every other day, though I didn’t wear the band to sleep most nights. If you keep the Luxe on when you go to bed, and also connect it to your phone’s GPS a lot, your runtime will likely be shorter.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The most impressive thing about the Fitbit Luxe isn’t its style; it’s its size. The fact that this little device can do so much is noteworthy, and those with smaller wrists will like the way it fits. But its size is also one of its drawbacks — its tiny screen makes things hard to read. Still, for $150, the Luxe is a well-made and capable fitness tracker that can track pretty much everything. If you’re looking for a simple activity band that’s smaller than most, this will serve you well. At least, as long as you have near-perfect vision.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-review-small-fitness-tracker-150008620.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e9e970f-69b1-4c31-b6b0-c01053faf536</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 15:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625841800</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:43:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery.
