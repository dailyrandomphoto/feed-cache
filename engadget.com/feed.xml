The document represents the most comprehensive analysis of the physical science behind climate change ever amassed in human history. The 284 scientists who worked on the project spent eight years examing data from more than 14,000 studies. They say human activity is &quot;unequivocally&quot; behind the Earth&#39;s rapidly changing climate.</p><p>Since the mid-19th century, the planet&#39;s temperature has increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, as a direct result of greenhouse gas emissions related to humans burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels for energy. We&#39;ve already seen the effects a warmer planet can have on humans. It was only earlier this summer that parts of Canada and the US Pacific Northwest suffered through a sweltering and unprecedented heatwave that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads">melted power cables, buckled roads</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/canada-heatwave-500-deaths">killed people</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion — such as continued sea level rise — are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years,&quot; the IPCC said.</p><div id="2cbdcd3b3154470ba12a0da665c084a2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These extreme events will only become more drastic in the future – this is why we cannot wait. Now is the time for action and Glasgow must be a turning point in this crisis. We need all countries to take the bold steps required to keep 1.5°C within reach.</p>— Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry (@ClimateEnvoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClimateEnvoy/status/1424710675461455873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Unless governments commit to sharply reducing emissions, limiting warming to the targets established in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-15-countries-reach-deal-to-implement-paris-climate-change-agreement.html">Paris Climate Agreement</a> will be &quot;beyond reach,&quot; the report warns. With a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html">1.5 degree Celsius</a> increase in global temperatures, there will be more frequent and life-threatening heat waves, droughts that leave millions struggling to find water and continued sea level rise that will likely displace coastal communities across the globe.</p><p>&quot;We can expect a significant jump in extreme weather over the next 20 or 30 years,&quot; Piers Forster, one of the climate scientists who contributed to the report, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. &quot;Things are unfortunately likely to get worse than they are today.&quot;</p><p>Reiterating past UN reports, the IPCC also warned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-2020-202805921.html">3 degree or even 4 degree Celsius increase</a> in global temperatures would be catastrophic. With every additional degree of warming, there&#39;s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even dramatic changes to the climate. According to the IPCC, drastic reductions in emissions can limit the worse effects of climate change and keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, it could take between 20 to 80 years to see global temperatures stabilize.</p><p>The report will be front and center when diplomats travel to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the UN&#39;s <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26 summit</a> on climate change. As one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases globally, the US can play a significant role in what happens next. After rejoining the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-rejoin-paris-agreement-official-190909769.html">Paris Climate Agreement</a>, President Biden pledged America would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">cut its greenhouse emissions in half by 2030</a>. Now more than ever, it&#39;s time to take action.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ipcc-2021-climate-change-report-182200028.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fee4e3b6-5d3f-4d3d-885c-9f9c935abf83</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 18:22:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628533324</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T18:22:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5aceac20-f93c-11eb-adbe-3f4470c4b73b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5aceac20-f93c-11eb-adbe-3f4470c4b73b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Swanson / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Firefighters extinguish spot fires along Route 89 Dixie Fire in Moccasin, now over 200,000 acres, California, U.S., July 28, 2021.

Many sous vide machines cost hundreds of dollars, but those looking to give the method a go don&#39;t have to spend that much now thanks to a new sale on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano" href="https://amzn.to/3s3XQ58">Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano</a>.

The method involves cooking food in a sealable bag that&#39;s submerged in heated water. The Precision Cooker Nano and other devices like it constantly circulate the water and keep it at the right temperature, ensuring your food is never over- or undercooked.</p><p>The Nano is the entry-level machine in Anova&#39;s lineup, making it the right pick for sous vide newbies. It uses 750 watts of power to heat up water and it&#39;ll run for up to 3,000 hours before it needs to be recharged. With that amount of power, you&#39;ll be able to easily cook meals for up to four people.</p><p>Aside from wattage and battery capacity, it differs from the more advanced devices in Anova&#39;s lineup in its clamp and connectivity. It has a fixed clamp, rather than a removable and adjustable one, that you&#39;ll use to secure the machine to your cooking pot. It also connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth rather than WiFi, but that still gives you access to the customizable controls in the Anova mobile app. You can set the cooking time and keep track of your cook while it&#39;s cooking in the app, plus the app gives you access to a bunch of recipes you can try, too. While it may be tempting to spring for the standard, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$199 Precision Cooker" href="https://amzn.to/3Cqbmox">$199 Precision Cooker</a> for it extra power and battery life, the Nano is arguably the best choice for home cooks who want to give a new method a try without spending too much money upfront.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anova-precision-cooker-nano-sous-vide-machine-deal-99-amazon-best-buy-143302550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">604feb9b-774f-40fd-acd3-fb22cd0c388d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 14:33:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628519412</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T14:30:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b665470-f918-11eb-bbee-5d55a51b70a8" width="1645" height="1311" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b665470-f918-11eb-bbee-5d55a51b70a8" width="1645" height="1311" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anova]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anova Precision Cooker Nano]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anova Precision Cooker Nano]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renault and China's Geely will form a hybrid-focused joint venture in Asia]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/renault"><ins>Renault</ins></a> is looking to revive flagging sales in China.

The Show 5 remains a handy nightstand companion, with solid sound quality for the money and a 2MP camera for video chats with family (there&#39;s a physical privacy shutter). The Show 8, meanwhile, has both strong sound quality and a 13MP wide-angle camera that can track you as you walk around. It may hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re looking for a kitchen display that will help you chat with friends while you cook dinner.</p><p>The same catches remain.

The Echo Show isn&#39;t for you if you want to revisit <em>Loki</em> or <em>Hacks</em>. Amazon still has a very robust smart home ecosystem, though, and the wide range of Alexa skills could be helpful if you ever need a specialized voice app.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kids-frames-sale-140208954.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">863b70ca-efec-4aac-9e8d-c42908217758</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 14:02:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515884</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nicole Lee/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Beats Studio Buds drop to a new record low of $130]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While leaks somewhat spoiled their launch, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats&#39; Studio Buds" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Beats&#39; Studio Buds</a> impressed us with their comfortable new design, balanced sound and seamless pairing with both Android and iOS devices. They were priced right, too, coming in at $150. But now the buds are on sale for the first time since they came out in June, so you can grab them for only $130 from Amazon. All three colors have been discounted, so you can choose your favorite and save $20.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the Beats Studio Buds a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html#callquality">score of 84</a> and we consider them to be the best pair of Beats buds for most people. They have a smaller, more comfortable design that some past Beats earbuds and their IPX4 water-resistant housing will keep them safe even during your sweatiest workouts. The buds pump out good sound with punchy bass and they work with Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature, too. You&#39;re also getting noise-cancellation that uses adaptive gain control to adjust in real time, blocking out distracting noises like that from dishwashers, wind and more. As far as battery life goes, the Studio Buds should get five to eight hours on a single charge, depending on your ANC use.</p><p>You may think that because these are Beats earbuds that they&#39;re designed with Apple users in mind, first and foremost. However, Beats added a number of new features that make these buds better for Android users, too. They still have the H1 chip inside, so you&#39;ll get fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. But Android users also have a Fast Pair feature now, too, which allows Android devices to immediately recognize the buds during the initial setup. The Studio Buds work with Android&#39;s Find My Device feature, so you can use that to see the last known location of your buds.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot to like about the Beats Studio Buds, especially at this $130 sale price. However, they lack a few key features: wireless charging, onboard volume controls and sound customizations. We also weren&#39;t impressed with their call quality either. But if you&#39;re willing to sacrifice in those areas, the Studio Buds remain solid options for both Android and iOS users who want a reliable, comfortable pair of wireless earbuds that won&#39;t break the bank.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-sale-130-amazon-133550651.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d33aed58-67d5-44c5-a458-1b77ee658b70</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515867</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds have a design with more universal appeal than its Powerbeats Pro.

However, shipping times are delayed (likely due to the rarity of this deal) so you&#39;ll have to wait until the beginning of September to receive them.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods (wireless charging case) at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3s1sbRP">Buy AirPods (wireless charging case) at Amazon - $130</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods at Amazon - $114" href="https://amzn.to/2VHG0bR">Buy AirPods at Amazon - $114</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $190" href="https://amzn.to/3CzNDCu">Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $190</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you don&#39;t want to wait, you can skip the wireless charging case and get <a href="https://amzn.to/2VHG0bR">the regular model</a> for $114 — not a record low, but $45 less than their normal price. It&#39;s also worth noting that the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CzNDCu">AirPods Pro</a> remain $60 off, bringing them down to $190.</p><p>Even if you haven&#39;t used AirPods before, you&#39;re probably quite familiar with them, especially if you use a lot of Apple products. They&#39;re the company&#39;s true wireless earbuds that, thanks to the H1 chipset inside, pair and switch seamlessly between iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. It makes the initial setup quick and easy, and it allows you to go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac with little delay. The H1 chip also improved upon the AirPods&#39; connection range, and it enables hands-free Siri access, too.</p><p>Convenience alone is reason enough for some to invest in AirPods, but they&#39;re also a solid pair of wireless earbuds as well. Sound quality is decent (we prefer the AirPods Pro if you want the best sound quality Apple earbuds can offer) and they&#39;ll last for about five hours on a single charge. And with the wireless charging case, you can set the AirPods on any Qi-compatible pad you have in your home when you need extra juice.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-wireless-charging-case-sale-amazon-124337805.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6d05b1c-bdb9-4530-96e3-18b21c6e3a88</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:43:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628513021</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T12:43:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tesla delays another vehicle to 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s electric pickup isn’t going anywhere this year.

That&#39;s according to its configuration page, telling you that you&#39;ll get to customize your truck when &quot;production nears in 2022.&quot; This applies regardless of model — single-motor trucks were always going to arrive later, but a new 2022 launch seems to for the dual- and tri-motor machines, too.</p><p>Tesla delivering on its promises has been a rare feat recently. Just last month, its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-the-semi-ev-debut-until-2022-citing-global-chip-shortages-160016735.html">semi truck was also pushed back to 2022</a>, due to supply constraints, both in sourcing batteries and the general mayhem that is COVID-19.

Employees at the battery plant previously only needed to wear masks if they hadn&#39;t been fully vaccinated.</p><p>The tipsters said Tesla was toughening its policy in the wake of the more easily transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, including updated CDC guidance recommending that vaccinated people wear masks indoors.

Elon Musk also threatened to move Tesla&#39;s headquarters out of California and sue the county. The move may have led to additional infections at the Fremont plant, and Musk said he contracted COVID-19 in November 2020.</p><p>It&#39;s easier for Tesla to comply this time when its factory can remain open.

Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">said in January</a> that there would only be a &quot;few deliveries&quot; of Cybertrucks in 2021, and that volume production was set for 2022. While the company stuck to that claim in its July quarterly report, the company only recently finished the engineering design for the EV — it would have just a few months to finish development and ship those initial trucks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That could pose a competitive challenge for Tesla. GMC&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html">Hummer EV</a> is now poised to beat the Cybertruck to market barring delays. Even with setbacks, Rivian is still due to release its R1T truck <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">in September</a>. And while Ford&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html">F-150 Lightning</a> isn&#39;t due until spring 2022, the Cybertruck may have lost its first-mover advantage.</p><p>The delay wouldn&#39;t be surprising, though. The Cybertruck&#39;s cold-rolled steel body requires unique manufacturing techniques, and that&#39;s not including broader technical hurdles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">tri-motor system</a>. Tesla is also known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-delayed-to-2021-222022916.html">optimistic timetables</a> that clash with the realities of production. The automaker can at least count on pent-up demand, though. With over 1 million Cybertruck reservations, Tesla could have plenty of demand even if many of those would-be buyers have second thoughts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d433f23e-7b91-467f-82c5-45521c4186c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 15:03:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628434991</ingested><modified>2021-08-08T15:03:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95c5d9f0-efb6-11eb-af7f-01a63ecf3054" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95c5d9f0-efb6-11eb-af7f-01a63ecf3054" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeenah Moon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla's Cybertruck is displayed at Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2021.

First, they didn’t give us instantaneous samples as required by sampling. Film frames are fat. They have duration. The camera shutter is open for a short exposure time. A moving object moves during that short interval, and so smears slightly across the frame during the film exposure time. It’s like what happens when you try to take a long-exposure still photo of your child throwing a ball and his arm is just a blur. This turns out to be a saving grace of cinema as it was actually practiced.</p><p>Second, they made it so each frame is projected twice (at least) by the projector. Ouch! That’s not sampling at all. Why did the inventors do that? Simple economics demanded it: 24 frames per second costs half as much film as 48 frames per second. But the eye needs to be refreshed about 50 times per second, or the retinal image fades between frames. Actually, 48 is close enough to 50 to work in a dark theater. How do you get 48 from 24? You show each frame twice! If you show just 24 frames per second, the screen appears to flicker. Hence the “flicks” from the early days of cinema before higher frame rates were adopted.</p><p>The third thing the original inventors did was to shut off the light between projected frames. This meant that 48 times per second, nothing (blackness) was projected into the eye — inside the pupil, onto the retina. It’s convenient for movie machines — both the camera and projector part — to “shutter” to blackness like this between frames. It allows time for the mechanical advancement of the next film frame into position. In a camera, it keeps the film from recording the real world during the physical advancement of the film. In a projector, it keeps the moving film out of eyesight as it’s physically advanced.</p><p>When you ask how a movie projector works, some people say something like this: There’s a top reel of film which is the source of film, and a bottom take-up reel. The film moves from reel to reel and passes between the light source of the projector and its lens, which magnifies the frame-size image up to screen size. In other words, the film moves continuously past the light source. But that doesn’t work. The eye sees exactly what’s there, and with this scheme the eye would see one frame sliding away as the next frame slides in from the opposite side. It would see the sliding. And that won’t work.</p><p>What a projector actually does is exactly this: It brings each frame into fixed position with the light source blocked. That’s the function of the shutter. Then the shutter opens and the illuminated frame projects onto the screen. Then the shutter closes. Then it opens again, and the illuminated frame is projected a second time onto the screen. Then the shutter closes and the next frame slides into position, and so forth.</p><p>We’ve just described the discrete, or intermittent, movement of film through a projector, as opposed to unworkable continuous movement. The same idea holds for a camera. The physical device that implements this action is called, in fact, an <em>intermittent movement</em>. This is the key notion in cinema history that is comparable to the conditional branch instruction in computer history. The mad rush to the movie machine turned on who first got a projector to work correctly, and that hinged on who got an intermittent movement working properly. It’s a defining notion.</p><p>To recap: An actual film-based movie projector doesn’t reconstruct a continuous visual flow from the frame samples and present this to the eye. Instead, it sends “fat samples” — thick with time duration and smeared motion — directly to the eye’s retina. It sends each frame twice, and it sends blackness between. It’s up to the brain to reconstruct motion from these inputs. How does that work?</p><p>Somehow the eye-brain system “reconstructs the visual flow” that’s represented by the fat visual samples it receives. Of course, it really does no such thing. Light intensities come in through the pupil as input. But the output from the eye to the brain, through the optic nerve, is an electrochemical pulse train. Neuronal pulse trains aren’t visual flows. It could be that the retina actually does reconstruct a visual flow and then converts it to pulse trains for brain consumption. The responses of some of the neurons in the eye certainly suggest the spreader function, complete with a high positive hump and negative lobes. But brain activity is beyond the scope of this book. Let’s concentrate instead on the customary explanations of the perception of motion from sequences of still snapshots.</p><h2><strong>Perception of Motion</strong></h2><p>The classic explanation is hoary old <em>persistence of vision</em>. It’s a real characteristic of human vision: once an image stimulus to the retina ceases, we continue to perceive the image there for a short while. But persistence of vision explains only why you don’t see the blackness between frames in the case of film-based movies. If an actor or an animated character moves to a new position between frames then — by persistence of vision — you should see him in both positions: two Humphrey Bogarts, two Buzz Lightyears. In fact, your retinas do see both, one fading out as the other comes in—each frame is projected long enough to ensure this. That’s persistence of vision. But it doesn’t explain why you perceive one moving object, not two objects at different positions. What your brain does with the information from the retinas determines whether you perceive two Bogarts in two different positions or one Bogart moving between them.</p><p>Psychophysicists have performed experiments to determine the characteristics of another real brain phenomenon, called <em>apparent motion</em>. The experiments don’t explain how the brain perceives motion, but they do describe the limitations of the phenomenon. A small white dot on a black background is presented to a subject’s retina. Then that dot is removed, and another dot is presented in a different position. The experimenters can vary two things, the spatial separation of the two dots and the time delay between position change. The brain perceives one dot here and another dot there, but only if the distance and delays are long enough. If the distance and delays are short, the brain perceives that the dot moves from one position to the other. It’s <em>apparent </em>motion because no actual motion is presented to the eye. The brain perceives what it doesn’t see.</p><h2><strong>Motion Blur</strong></h2><p>Persistence of vision is such that we still perceive the first image when the second one arrives. That sounds a lot like frame spreading. A frame of short duration spreads out in time and adds to the next frame also spread out in time. It’s as if the retina does the image spreading and the adding of successive spread frames. Something like this must be going on because we perceive a continuous visual field although the film projector doesn’t present one. You can think of the shape of the persistence function of the eye as the shape of the frame spreader that’s built into us human perceivers. Another reason we can assume that the eye-brain system must be doing a reconstruction, one that implicitly uses the Sampling Theorem, is because we perceive exactly the errors we would expect if that were the actual mechanism—such as wagon wheels spinning backward.</p><p>Classic cel animation — of the old ink-on-celluloid variety — relies on the apparent-motion phenomenon. The old animators knew intuitively how to keep the successive frames of a movement inside its “not too far, not too slow” boundaries. If they needed to exceed those limits, they had tricks to help us perceive the motion. They drew actual speed lines, which showed the brain the direction of motion and implied that it was fast, like a blur. Or they provided a <em>POOF </em>of dust to mark the rapid descent of Wile E. Coyote as he stepped unexpectedly off a mesa in hot pursuit of that truly wily Road Runner. They provided a visual language that the brain could interpret.</p><p>Exceed the apparent motion limits — without those animators’ tricks — and the results are ugly. You may have seen old school stop-motion animations — such as Ray Harryhausen’s classic sword-fighting skeletons in <em>Jason and the Argonauts </em>(1963) — that are plagued by an unpleasant jerking motion of the characters. You’re seeing double, at least — several edges of a skeleton at the same time — and correctly interpret it as motion, but painfully so. The edges stutter, or “judder,” or “strobe” across the screen. Those words reflect the pain inflicted by staccato motion.</p><p>Live-action movies are sequences of discrete frames just like animations. Why don’t these movies stutter? (Imagine directing Uma Thurman to stay within “not too far, not too slow” limits.) There’s a general explanation that works. It’s called <em>motion blur</em>, and it’s simple and pretty. A frame that’s recorded by a real movie camera is fat with duration. It’s not a sample at a single instant like a Road Runner or a Harryhausen frame. Motion blur is what you see in a still photograph when the subject moves and the shutter isn’t fast enough to stop the motion. In still photographs, it’s often an unintended result, but it turns out to be a feature in movies. Without the blur all movies would look as jerky as Harryhausen’s skeletons—unless Uma miraculously stayed within limits. The motion blur of moving objects in a fat frame gives clues to the brain about what is moving and what is not. The direction of a blur gives the direction of motion, and its length indicates the speed. Somehow, mysteriously, the brain converts that spatial information — the blurs — into temporal information and then perceives motion with the help of the apparent motion phenomenon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-biography-of-the-pixel-alvy-ray-smith-mit-press-153048574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8e704fe-1ee4-4627-afef-0e3a940d8800</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 15:30:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628518026</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T14:07:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/788a2840-f485-11eb-bfe9-2029a9502d00" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/788a2840-f485-11eb-bfe9-2029a9502d00" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Music Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Michael Jackson eating popcorn in a movie theater]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Michael Jackson popcorn]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
