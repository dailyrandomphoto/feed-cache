As long as you owned a copy of the game, you had access to it. However, much like Rockstar did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/red-dead-online-release-date-standalone-rockstar-games-172148154.html"><em>Red Dead Online</em></a>, Sony now plans to offer a standalone version of Legends.</p><p>Available starting on September 3rd, the company will sell this release of the mode for $19.99. Aside from some in-game cosmetics you can only earn by playing through <em>Ghost of Tsushima’s</em> single-player story, everything that’s included in the version that comes with the full game is also present here, and you can play with those who own the entire experience. That first point is important because Sucker Punch has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/">various free updates planned for Legends</a>, the most notable of which is a new mode called Rivals that comes out on the same day as the standalone release.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Taking a page from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-19-destiny-2-forsaken-gambit-mode-free-weekend.html"><em>Destiny 2’s</em> Gambit mode</a>, Rivals pits two teams of two individuals against waves of enemies. As you defeat foes, you’ll earn a resource called “Magatama,” which you can use to delay the opposing team by doing things like casting curses on them. Once you’ve spent enough Magatama, you will unlock a final wave. Defeat that, and you’ll have won the match.&nbsp;</p><p>Sucker Punch has other updates for Legends planned, including a variety of quality-of-life tweaks. Starting on September 10th, the studio also plans to release content each week until October 1st. Players can look forward to new Survival mode maps and a more challenging version of last year’s raid.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide you want to play through <em>Ghost of Tsushima’s </em>single-player story after experiencing Legends by itself, you can purchase an upgrade to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html">Director’s Cut</a>, which includes the full story and a new island to explore, for $40 on PS4 or $50 on PS5.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-standalone-release-september-3-165034525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17ba6d6c-aa3b-4833-9e24-6a79f111e6ac</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 16:50:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628094807</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:33:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64790690-f53f-11eb-9b9f-85156022e950" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64790690-f53f-11eb-9b9f-85156022e950" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sucker Punch Productions / Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heatworks opens pre-orders for its plumbing-free countertop dishwasher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/heatworks">Heatworks</a> has at long last <a href="https://myheatworks.com/products/tetra-specs">opened pre-orders</a> for the Tetra, a countertop dishwasher the company unveiled to some fanfare <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/heatworks-countertop-dishwasher-is-pretty-and-practical/">at CES 2018</a>. Since the Tetra doesn&#39;t require any plumbing, the only thing you need to connect it to is an electrical outlet. The appliance has a three-liter tank you fill with water manually. Once the cycle (which takes less than an hour on the shortest setting) is complete, you disconnect the greywater tank and pour out the used water.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dishwasher">dishwasher</a> can wash and dry three place settings worth of dishes per load. On the surface, it might seem wasteful compared with cleaning those plates, cups and utensils manually, not to mention the counter space the machine will hog. However, Heatworks claims the machine requires less water than handwashing and rinsing the dishes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are several settings, including a &quot;fruit&quot; one for washing produce. In addition, the dishwasher uses recyclable cartridges with concentrated detergent in an attempt to reduce waste.</p><div id="e0f05ac230874cea8a7f6cc70a2c2859"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE TETRA COUNTERTOP DISHWASHER PREORDER BEGINS NOW.

To heat up water, Heatworks uses Ohmic Array Technology, as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-the-plumbing-free-countertop-dishwa-1847395855"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> notes. The Tetra takes a microwave-style approach to heating water rather than harnessing traditional metal elements. It <a href="https://myheatworks.com/blogs/press/heatworks-announces-tetra-the-connected-countertop-dishwasher-at-ces">uses</a> graphite electrodes and &quot;advanced electronic controls&quot; to excite natural minerals in water. That setup allows the Tetra to efficiently heat water and maintain precise temperature control, according to Heatworks.</p><p>While there are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VR22832/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=63145939387785dd7b5b8b2e58a8720d&amp;creativeASIN=B07VR22832">other countertop dishwashers</a> that don&#39;t need a plumbing connection, the Tetra has a smaller water tank than many of its rivals. Farberware&#39;s FDW05ASBWHA model (which is currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VR22832/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=63145939387785dd7b5b8b2e58a8720d&amp;creativeASIN=B07VR22832&amp;th=1">$340</a>) has a five-liter capacity. The Tetra may heat water more efficiently than other models as well.</p><p>The Tetra will typically cost $499, but Heatworks is offering a $100 discount to those who <a href="https://myheatworks.com/products/tetra-specs">lock in a preorder now</a>. The detergent cartridges will cost around $6 each and they should be good for 20 loads depending on the setting and load capacity. Heatworks expects to start shipping the Tetra by May 18th, 2022, which is No Dirty Dishes Day.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/heatworks-tetra-plumbing-free-countertop-dishwasher-pre-orders-161727197.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf2f9778-22d0-474c-a496-8a6615df4daf</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 16:17:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628093814</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:17:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Appliances]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/76baab40-f53c-11eb-88fb-66b35c4196a6" width="1373" height="775" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/76baab40-f53c-11eb-88fb-66b35c4196a6" width="1373" height="775" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Heatworks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tetra Countertop Dishwasher]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tetra Countertop Dishwasher]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to expect at Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked in August]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="a3683935bbb545499eb0a940e5a20dd9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaMDQn7xTtg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>If you’re a big Samsung fan, you’ve probably already marked your calendar for August 11th, when the company is holding its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-date-august-11-foldable-smartwatch-no-note-000036462.html">next Galaxy Unpacked event</a>. Though it has held <em>many</em> events already in 2021, at least this time around it’s one that we’ve been anticipating. In recent years, Samsung has unveiled new Note phones every August. But at this coming Unpacked, the company will <em>not </em>be showing off a new Note. Thanks to the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-unpacked-line-up-revealed-in-huge-new-leak-095533534.html"> enterprising rumor mill</a> and, well, Samsung itself, we have a good idea of what to expect next Wednesday.</p><h2>Foldables: The third generation</h2><p>The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-august-2021-s-pen-foldables-galaxy-z-fold-3-z-flip-230006850.html">published a blog post last month</a> in which its president TM Roh teased what’s to come. First up: foldables. Yes, that’s plural. We’ll be seeing the third-generation of the Galaxy Z series, including the next Z Flip and Z Fold. If you’ll recall, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">the Z Flip</a> is the smaller, Moto Razr-style phone that looks like a regular phone that you can close in half. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">the Z Fold</a> is more of a tablet-phone hybrid, where a 6.2-inch device opens up to reveal a 7.6-inch screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What might Samsung bring in new versions of these devices? Based on the <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422248655747231744">leaks floating</a><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-leaked-renders-hd/">around the internet</a>, the Z Flip 3 will possibly have a 1.9-inch outer screen with a 6.7-inch internal flexible display. That external panel is significantly bigger than the 1.1-inch sliver on the older Z Flip, which could make it more useful when the device is shut. We’ve also seen reports that the inside screen will run at 120Hz and sport dual 12-megapixel rear cameras and a 10-megapixel selfie shooter.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d082470-f0b6-11eb-9d99-dbf213cf2005" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 standing in portrait orientation on a wooden table with its screen partly folded and facing the camera. It shows a YouTube video playing. " data-uuid="79e6a8f2-7850-307b-aed8-b407518a846a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Z Fold 3 is <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370">rumored</a> to have a similar setup to the existing model, with a 6.2-inch exterior panel and a 7.6-inch version inside. It’ll probably have triple 12-megapixel cameras and two selfie cameras on either side. Both models are reported to be rated IPX8 for water resistance, though dust resistance clearly still remains a challenge. These are all educated guesses based on what’s been leaked, so I’d take the details with a grain of salt.</p><p>What <em>has</em> been confirmed is that the foldables will support Samsung’s S Pen. The stylus has been a hallmark of the Note series and the company enabled support for it on its flagship S series earlier this year. In his blog post, Roh said the S Pen was specifically designed for its foldables.</p><p>A stylus made for the pliable screens on foldables has been a widely requested feature, and would make the larger, opened up displays more useful. Of course, Samsung shared little else about this S Pen besides the fact that it&#39;s coming, so there are plenty of unknowns at the moment. How will it avoid damaging the softer, flexible screen? What size is its nib, what is its pressure sensitivity and will the foldables have onboard slots to house it? Will it have Bluetooth support for remote control actions? Clearly, these are things we&#39;ll have to wait till Unpacked on August 11th to learn about.</p><h2>Wearables: New headphones and Wear OS watches&nbsp;</h2><p>Samsung also already spilled the beans on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wear-os-one-ui-watch-unpacked-2021-171520963.html">upcoming Galaxy Watch running the new Wear OS</a> that it co-engineered with Google. We’ve also seen plenty of leaked renders of the purported Galaxy Watch 4, which is likely to come in an Active and a Classic edition. The latter might be available in three sizes instead of just two, and appears to feature the popular rotating bezel Samsung’s watches are known for. Expect to see more details about the hardware and the UI at Unpacked, in addition to pricing and availability.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a20e3090-dda6-11ea-bbff-d9677ae541dc" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 review" data-uuid="a8641d58-6be8-4777-8211-b4bb0ece75ce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s not the only wearable that will make an appearance. We’ve also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leak-202831568.html">seen leaks</a> indicating new Galaxy Buds 2 might show up at Unpacked. The company’s next wireless earbuds appear to have a more refined design and more color options. One report based on a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-app-leak/">beta version of an upcoming plugin on Samsung’s update server</a> also indicated the possibility of active noise cancellation, touch controls and a simplified battery interface.</p><p>That’s pretty much all we know so far, though I wouldn’t put it past Samsung to have something else hidden up its sleeve for the event. Will Blackpink show up? I wish. But as for actual hardware, this is already a pretty long list of things to expect come August 11th. Samsung’s launch kicks off at 10am Eastern that day, and you should come watch it with us on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget">Engadget’s YouTube channel</a>. We’ll be starting at 9:40AM Eastern with a pre-show and hanging around after Samsung wraps to answer your burning questions. I hope to see you then!</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-z-fold-3-z-flip-3-watch-active-4-buds-2-154226625.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f16d6bf9-4c8a-49f0-9e27-1a33d4a233c7</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:42:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628093141</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:05:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d082470-f0b6-11eb-9d99-dbf213cf2005" width="3000" height="1968" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84f0eef0-f53b-11eb-b3d2-eeb1dfbfd37a" width="3000" height="1968" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Fold]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Fold]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lucille Ball's radio show is now a 'podcast' on SiriusXM]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lucille Ball sadly passed away long before podcasts became a reality, but that isn&#39;t stopping her from joining the modern phenomenon.

While that it in itself is relatively rare, the researchers have also noticed that it&#39;s spinning unusually slowly for a supernova remnant at 8.9 hours for a full rotation.</p><p>The team determined that the repeated, rapid changes in brightness were likely due to the surface rotating into view. All stars spin, but that process is accelerated for any star pieces surviving a violent explosion like this.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The observation has provided clues as to the likely origins of the fragment. LP 40-365 was likely part of a white dwarf star &#39;feeding&#39; on the mass of a partner in a binary system. As the two stars were spinning so closely and quickly, both of them were likely flung outward when LP 40-365&#39;s star exploded.</p><p>The composition of the star could also provide insights. Intact stars are normally made from hydrogen and helium, but this leftover is mostly composed of metal. The reactions from the supernova produced more complex elements, researchers said.</p><p>The shard represents a rare opportunity to study a phenomenon that science was only ready to consider a few years ago. It also provides a more complete picture of how supernovas behave — they&#39;ve never been tidy, but it&#39;s now clearer just how messy they can be.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/supernova-star-fragment-leaving-milky-way-141058874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">566dce97-c426-4773-8635-69e7304b6415</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 14:10:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628087494</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T14:31:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8b997260-f520-11eb-a7ce-68cccb2d2511" width="3872" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8b997260-f520-11eb-a7ce-68cccb2d2511" width="3872" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stocktrek Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this artists rendering, an outer shell of gas and dust, which erupted from the star hundreds of years ago, obscures the supernova within.

Here, you get an LCD instead of the Plus&#39; AMOLED display with 2,560 x 1,600 resolution versus 1,752 x 2,800 pixels.

After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-tencent-restructure.html">opening</a> a front in gaming back in 2018, the government is now adding to the restraints the biggest publishers face. Tencent is first on the chopping block. The publisher has been forced to further slash playing time on <em>Honor of Kings </em>for those aged under 18<em>&nbsp;</em>to one hour during regular days and two hours on weekends. The rules, designed to appease the country&#39;s all-powerful censors, come into effect today, according to state media outlet the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3143779/tencent-cuts-kids-playing-time-flagship-game-honour-kings-appease"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, play time in China was capped at 90 minutes per day during the week and three hours per day at weekends and holidays as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-china-gaming-addiction-regulations.html">broader rules</a> introduced in 2019. Additional restrictions banned younger gamers from playing between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. and curbed how much they could spend on downloadable content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Honor of Kings</em> is a hugely popular multiplayer online battle arena game developed by Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group, also known for <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> and <em>Pokémon Unite</em>. As of November, the mobile title boasted 100 million players. But, its success has also brought with it increased scrutiny. In June, Tencent found itself at the center of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-clash-of-kings-arena-of-valor-lawsuit-142559708.html">lawsuit </a>that accused it of including &quot;inappropriate&quot; content in <em>Honor of Kings, </em>including characters with low-cut clothes and historical inaccuracies.</p><p>The latest crackdown comes amid growing fears in China over the addictive nature of video games. On Tuesday, a state-affiliated media outlet described the products produced by the gaming industry as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/technology/china-video-game-tencent.html">spiritual opium</a>.” The article continued: “No industry or sport should develop at the price of destroying a generation.”</p><p>Therein lies the broader issue. China is currently grappling with a generational divide that has seen younger citizens reject the competitive lifestyle pressures heaped upon them. This stance is encapsulated by the &quot;tang ping,&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/lifestyle/article/3136962/chinas-disenchanted-youth-lie-flat-cope-modern-life">lying flat</a>,&quot; philosophy embraced by a growing number of Gen Z Chinese. In a nutshell, it signifies those who choose not to work hard, not to buy property and not to marry and have children.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of addressing the societal complaints, China is choosing to deflect the blame onto the gaming industry.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tencent-limits-honor-of-kings-play-time-122045915.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41a52209-1126-4eb4-a67a-66426bc713a3</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 12:20:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628079648</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T12:20:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bfc39330-f418-11eb-8fdb-96c22bdd1b5c" width="4770" height="3198" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bfc39330-f418-11eb-8fdb-96c22bdd1b5c" width="4770" height="3198" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 9, 2021 - A photo taken on July 9, 2021 shows Tencent's game Honor of Kings at the Electronic Sports Human PK AI competition held at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2021 in Shanghai, China.&#xA; (Photo credit should read Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honour of Kings exhibition stand In The 2021 World Artificial Intelligence Conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vudu and FandangoNow merge into a single streaming service]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fandango has revealed Vudu&#39;s fate more than a year after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fandango-vudu-deal-walmart-streaming-192652676.html">purchased</a> the streaming platform from Walmart.

It’s a predictable issue: The camera has to face out through the screen, affected by whatever the pixels are displaying.</p><p>Oppo has announced its third-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html">under-screen camera</a> which, based on a sample shot, shows a lot of promise. Even if it’s a company’s own sample, there’s no noticeable haziness nor glare. The company explains this is possible through a combination of electronic engineering and AI smarts. Oppo says it trained its own AI engine &quot;using tens of thousands of photos&quot; to achieve more accurate corrections on diffraction, white balance and HDR.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/512e01e0-f476-11eb-a6f3-0b5b1f4fa8d4" style="height:1065;width:1600;" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="aeb6f0ea-9176-3f80-a400-1620e9472bae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure></a><p>Then there’s the display. Earlier designs lowered the pixel density in the area above the camera to let more light into the sensor. This, however, made a noticeable patch above the camera. But now, Oppo — or whichever company is making its smartphone displays, possibly Samsung — figured out a way to boost light transmittance by shrinking each pixel&#39;s geometry. In other words, it keeps the same pixel density, but more light can reach the camera sensor.</p><p>Oppo hasn’t mentioned a date — or new phone — for the under-screen camera, but ZTE claims to feature an improved version of its under-screen camera in its new <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-5g-under-display-camera-120041472.html"><ins>Axon 30 5G</ins></a>, which launched in China last week.

It told <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/t-mobile-to-shutter-sprints-lte-network-on-june-30-2022/d/d-id/771269"><em>Light Reading</em></a> that it will shutter the service by June 30, 2022. Since completing the $26 billion merger, T-Mobile has been busy using Sprint&#39;s spectrum to expand the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-5g-network-sprint-merger-145215409.html">rollout of its 5G network</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the transition hasn&#39;t been completely smooth. With the deal raising competition concerns, antitrust regulators set out a number of conditions to get it across the line. The goal was to make Dish Network the nation&#39;s new fourth carrier. To get it there, T-mobile was ordered to hand over spectrum, the Boost prepaid mobile brand — and the 9 million customers signed up to it — and to act as Dish&#39;s network provider for up to seven years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the partnership turned sour when T-Mobile announced that it would shut down Sprint&#39;s CDMA network by January 2022, which a majority of those 9 million customers use.

In particular, the team wanted to know how political advertisers choose the demographic their ads target and <em>don&#39;t</em> target. Shortly after the project called the NYU Ad Observatory went live, however, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-researcher-api-fringe-groups-195545901.html">notified</a> the researchers that their efforts violate its terms of service related to bulk data collection. Now, the social network has announced that it has &quot;disabled the accounts, apps, Pages and platform access associated with NYU&#39;s Ad Observatory Project and its operators...&quot;</p><p>The researchers created a browser extension to collect data on the political ads the website shows the thousands of people who volunteered to be part of the initiative. Facebook says, however, that the plug-in was made to avoid its detection system and calls what it can do &quot;unauthorized scraping.&quot; The extension &quot;scrape[d] data such as usernames, ads, links to user profiles and &#39;Why am I seeing this ad?&#39; information,&quot; Facebook wrote in its announcement. It also said that the extension collected data about Facebook users who didn&#39;t install it and didn&#39;t consent to take part in the project.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company wrote that it made &quot;repeated attempts to bring [the team&#39;s] research into compliance with [its] Terms.&quot; That apparently included inviting the researchers to access its US 2020 Elections ad targeting data through FORT’s Researcher Platform. Facebook said the data set on the platform could offer more comprehensive information than what the extension can collect, but the researchers declined its invitation.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-shutdown-of-nyu-research-project-into-political-ad-targeting-11603488533"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> mentioned in its report last year, Facebook has an archive of advertisements on its platform, which includes data on who paid for an ad, when it ran and the location of the people who saw it. However, it doesn&#39;t contain targeting information, such as how it&#39;s determined who sees the ad. On its website, Ad Observer researchers <a href="https://adobserver.org/">wrote</a>: &quot;We think it&#39;s important to democracy to be able to check who is trying to influence the public and how.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook is adamant that it disabled the project&#39;s access to its platform because it knowingly violated the website&#39;s terms against scraping. It blocked the team&#39;s access to its platform, it said, in order to &quot;stop unauthorized scraping and protect people&#39;s privacy in line with [its] privacy program.&quot; After the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-uk-ico-cambridge-analytica-fine.html">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal, it agreed to an updated policy with the FTC, which pushed the social network to limit third-party access to its data. We asked the Ad Observer team for a statement and will update this post if we hear back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 8/04/21 7PM ET:</strong> Laura Edelson, the lead researcher behind NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy, which operates Ad Observatory, told <em>Engadget</em> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This evening, Facebook suspended my Facebook account and the accounts of several people associated with Cybersecurity for Democracy, our team at NYU. This has the effect of cutting off our access to Facebook&#39;s Ad Library data, as well as Crowdtangle. Over the last several years, we’ve used this access to uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, to identify misinformation in political ads including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation. By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, including our work measuring vaccine misinformation with the Virality Project and many other partners who rely on our data.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The work our team does to make data about disinformation on Facebook transparent is vital to a healthy internet and a healthy democracy. Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform. Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">82d3713b-8bb3-402b-8aa3-0386280b7766</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 09:10:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628075741</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T11:15:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Feb 16, 2020 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign, located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters, Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple restores the dedicated 'Store' tab to its website]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After going down briefly earlier today, Apple&#39;s website has returned with a new design that reintroduces a &quot;<a href="https://www.apple.com/store">Store</a>&quot; tab not unlike the one it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-06-apples-website-store-death.html">removed</a> nearly six years ago, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-website-redesigned-store/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> has reported. That leads to a dedicated buying section where customers can select from its product lineup, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. With the new tweaks, you&#39;ll no longer need to visit each product page and track down the &quot;buy&quot; button to see options or make a purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with a horizontal list of products, the Store page shows the latest products, promotions, accessories and more. It now more closely resembles the Apple Store app, as <em>MacRumors</em> pointed out.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Clicking on a category like &quot;iPhone&quot; in the Store tab takes you to a carousel that shows all the current models available, like the iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone SE and iPhone XR. Once you select a specific model like the iPhone 12 Pro, it takes you to the buy page for that item where you can start to select color, storage and other options. Previously, you would have needed to click on the iPhone product page, scroll down to find a specific model and click on the &quot;buy&quot; button.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&#39;s website had a Store tab before the 2015 redesign, but it essentially shunted you to a completely different domain. The new design works differently: You still remain on the Apple.com site, and the Store tab simply gives you a different way of navigating to the buying section. A subtle change, but significant considering the enormous worldwide traffic to Apple&#39;s website.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-website-makes-it-easier-to-shop-with-a-dedicate-store-tab-071232449.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7843fc13-2662-428b-8a65-318ababf0fab</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 07:12:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628061154</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T07:12:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7b372f20-f4ee-11eb-bfbf-b902e0b271bb" width="1344" height="684" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7b372f20-f4ee-11eb-bfbf-b902e0b271bb" width="1344" height="684" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple restores the dedicated 'Store' tab to its website]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple restores the dedicated 'Store' tab to its website]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nissan's Leaf S is now the cheapest EV in the US at $27,400]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nissan has unveiled its 2022 Leaf with more standard features and a lower base price that makes it the cheapest EV in the US, the company <a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#">announced</a>. The most basic model, the Leaf S with a 40-kWh battery, now costs $27,400 or $28,375 including the destination charge — or $20,875 if you qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit. That means it&#39;s less than the $29,900 Mini SE and can go farther, too, with 149 miles of range versus 114.&nbsp;</p><p>The 40-kWh Leaf SV drops from $34,935 to $28,800, while the longer-range 62-kWh Leaf SV Plus is now $32,400 compared to $38,245 (all prices exclude destination charges and federal incentives). The S and SV models deliver 147 horsepower, 236 pound feet of torque and up to 149 miles of EPA range, while the S Plus offers more powerful 160-kW motor that produces 214 horsepower, 250 pound feet of torque and 226 miles of range.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/33c5c7e0-f4e5-11eb-bb7f-3b4e99a1c642" alt="Nissan&#39;s Leaf S is now the cheapest EV in the US at $27,400" data-uuid="bfc30700-0b2f-3e2f-bdde-1e028c851c1d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div></figure><p>The $4,245 price drop for the basic S Leaf compared to the 2021 model, and even more dramatic $6,135 decrease for the SV model, sounds like a lot. However, the new prices essentially match what buyers were paying for Leafs last year if you count buyer incentives, as <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-nissan-leaf-plus-price/"><em>Motor Trend</em></a> reported. And of course, the Leaf has essentially become passé as Nissan prepares to sell the Ariya <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissans-next-gen-ariya-ev-has-been-delayed-until-winter-2021-064700085.html">early in 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the new prices will help buyers compare prices without having to jump through hoops. And the new models do have some useful improvements. The main thing is that all Leaf models now include a CHAdeMo quick charge port, ProPilot assist and Nissan&#39;s &quot;Intelligent Around View&quot; monitor as standard.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-22-2019-nissan-leaf-plus-review.html">Leaf isn&#39;t as fun</a>, nor as attractive, as a lot of other EVs out there. But $20,875 for the base model, (including federal incentives and destination charge) is the lowest number we&#39;ve seen next to a brand new EV with decent range in the US, ever.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nissans-entry-level-leaf-is-now-the-cheapest-ev-in-the-us-at-27400-053932185.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3952182-c16c-423f-a3fa-8d81d65792dc</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 05:39:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628082357</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T13:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1bd20950-f4e5-11eb-ace6-9b86bd46e804" width="2000" height="1197" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1bd20950-f4e5-11eb-ace6-9b86bd46e804" width="2000" height="1197" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nissan]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nissan's Leaf S is now the cheapest EV in the US at $27,400]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nissan's Leaf S is now the cheapest EV in the US at $27,400]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google leak gave us a glimpse of its upcoming Nest cameras and doorbells]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps Google has started preparing for the launch of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest</a> camera products, which is why they showed up on the company&#39;s store for a very brief period.

Other players such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-vivo-apex-2020-gimbal-camera-zoom.html">Vivo</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-12-oppo-find-x2-camera-all-pixel-omni-directional-pdaf.html">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-oppo-under-screen-selfie-camera-demo.html">Xiaomi</a> had also been testing this futuristic tech, but given the subpar image quality back then, it&#39;s no wonder that phone makers largely stuck with punch-hole cameras for selfies.</p><p>Despite much criticism of its first under-screen camera, ZTE worked what it claims to be an improved version into its new <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-5g-under-display-camera-120041472.html">Axon 30 5G</a>, which launched in China last week. Coincidentally, today Oppo unveiled its third-gen under-screen camera which, based on a sample shot it provided, appears to be surprisingly promising — no noticeable haziness nor glare. But that was just one photo, of course, so I&#39;ll obviously reserve my final judgement until I get to play with one. Even so, the AI tricks and display circuitry that made this possible are intriguing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a13119c0-f476-11eb-b5d3-8db0014d2c5d" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="bf22a4ea-1510-3fc2-9bf9-cd1a721bb8ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>In a nutshell, nothing has changed in terms of how the under-screen camera sees through the screen. Its performance is limited by how much light can travel through the gaps between each OLED pixel. Therefore, AI compensation is still a must. For its latest under-screen camera, Oppo says it trained its own AI engine &quot;using tens of thousands of photos&quot; in order to achieve more accurate corrections on diffraction, white balance and HDR. Hence the surprisingly natural-looking sample shot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8153c080-f476-11eb-b579-24b6053eb2ad" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="a614d4fe-7ca3-37fd-88d9-eabdfb41d2be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Another noteworthy improvement here lies within the display panel&#39;s consistency. The earlier designs chose to lower the pixel density in the area above the camera, in order to let sufficient light into the sensor. This resulted in a noticeable patch above the camera, which would have been a major turn-off when you watched videos or read fine text on that screen.</p><p>But now, Oppo — or the display panel maker, which could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-launch-new-foldables-and-make-the-category-mainstream-054254837.html">Samsung</a> — figured out a way to boost light transmittance by slightly shrinking each pixel&#39;s geometry above the camera. In order words, we get to keep the same 400-ppi pixel density as the rest of the screen, thus creating a more consistent look.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a10acd10-f476-11eb-bf94-0988da44a582" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="94978d0a-40c2-3f67-8dbb-0e2b21ff6eeb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo added that this is further enhanced by a transparent wiring material, as well as a one-to-one pixel-circuit-to-pixel architecture (instead of two-to-one like before) in the screen area above the camera. The latter promises more precise image control and greater sharpness, with the bonus being a 50-percent longer panel lifespan due to better burn-in prevention.</p><p>Oppo didn&#39;t say when or if consumers will get to use its next-gen under-screen camera, but given the timing, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this turns out to be the same solution on the ZTE Axon 30 5G. In any case, it would be nice if the industry eventually agreed to dump punch-hole cameras in favor of invisible ones.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e0d5086-f928-4618-b6fd-58613766154f</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 03:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628022137</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T20:22:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/512e01e0-f476-11eb-a6f3-0b5b1f4fa8d4" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/512e01e0-f476-11eb-a6f3-0b5b1f4fa8d4" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oppo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo's next-gen under-screen camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo's next-gen under-screen camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Diablo Immortal' has been postponed until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-02-diablo-immortal-brings-blizzards-action-rpg-to-ios-and-androi.html"><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> may be a game for tiny screens, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a small feat of development. For precisely this reason, Activision Blizzard has delayed the release of <em>Diablo Immortal </em>to early 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The action RPG was originally supposed to hit iOS and Android devices this year, but developers need more time to fine-tune PvP content, improve PvE experiences and implement additional accessibility options, according to <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo-immortal/23706474/diablo-immortal-development-update">Blizzard</a>. Here&#39;s how developers put it in their blog post:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Following feedback provided by test participants of the Closed Alpha, our team has been tuning core and endgame features. For example, we’re iterating on PvP content like the Cycle of Strife to make it more accessible, alongside late-game PvE content like the Helliquary to make it more engaging. We’re also working to provide controller support for those who want to play our game in a different way. However, these changes and additional opportunities to improve our gameplay experience will not be realized in the 2021 timeframe we had previously communicated. So, the game is now planned for release in the first half of 2022, which will allow us to add substantial improvements to the whole game.</p></blockquote><p>Blizzard goes on to describe specific features it&#39;ll focus on, such as adding PvE Raids, adjusting Bounties and making Challenge Rifts more exciting. In terms of PvP adjustments, Blizzard will work on improving matchmaking, earning rankings, class balance, time to kill and other elements of the Battleground system, plus it&#39;ll spit-shine the Cycle of Strife endgame content. All of this joins a raft of changes to progression and XP caps.</p><p>It seems developers are still in the early stages when it comes to getting <em>Diablo Immortal </em>to play nice with gamepads.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re still working through the challenges of adapting the touch screen controls to a controller seamlessly,&quot; the blog reads. &quot;Making our game more accessible is top of mind, and we’ll share more progress on this front as we approach the beta in the future.&quot;</p><p>Blizzard has <em>other </em>things on its plate right now, too. Activision Blizzard is facing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit</a> from the state of California, and Blizzard president J. Allen Brack <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">left the company today</a> amid allegations that he overlooked abuse in the workplace for years. Blizzard&#39;s head of HR, Jesse Meschuk, also left the studio this week. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">second lawsuit</a> was filed by shareholders today, claiming Activision Blizzard failed to disclose potential regulatory issues related to the company&#39;s discriminatory, frat-house-style culture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-delay-2022-blizzard-225447721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7527ae09-1a55-4efb-90b6-e29a3ecea722</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 22:54:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628030638</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T22:44:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fada4bc0-f4aa-11eb-9f3f-169363585558" width="2684" height="1510" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fada4bc0-f4aa-11eb-9f3f-169363585558" width="2684" height="1510" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blizzard]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp adds disappearing ‘view once’ photos to its app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is adding <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/view-once-photos-and-videos-on-whatsapp/">disappearing</a> photo messages to its app. Called “view once” photos, the new feature allows users to send photos and videos in chats that can only be viewed a single time before disappearing. &quot;View once,&quot; appeared in the beta version of WhatsApp&#39;s Android app back <a href="https://engadget.com/whatsapp-android-view-once-messages-124030396.html">in June</a>, but it&#39;s rolling out to all users this week.</p><p>The Snapchat-like feature is similar to Instagram and Messenger’s disappearing photo <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1310346208996329">features</a>.

The company also points out that “view once” photos that are reported will be made visible to WhatsApp.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-disappearing-photos-view-once-223842664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5035292b-bafb-4b9e-8129-9a8b4dfad02f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 22:38:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628094009</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:20:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8af76670-f4a6-11eb-bbbb-86988b2a36f0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8af76670-f4a6-11eb-bbbb-86988b2a36f0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp will allow users to send "view once" photos that disappear after being viewed.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp view once photos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard faces an investor lawsuit stemming from its discrimination case]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">harassment and discrimination lawsuit</a> from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) isn’t the only legal battle Activision Blizzard has to worry about anymore.

The company <a href="https://starlinerupdates.com/nasa-boeing-to-delay-starliner-launch/">attributed the delay</a> to &quot;unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system&quot; engineers spotted during pre-launch preparations. It&#39;s currently unclear if the issue is related to Starliner or the Atlas V rocket that was supposed to carry the vessel to space. Boeing and NASA said they will provide an update on the situation on Wednesday, August 4th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8ceea3cd1e664f34b85abae89dd00c3c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re standing down from today&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starliner</a> Orbital Flight Test-2 launch. <br><br>During pre-launch preparations, our engineers detected unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system.<br><br>Read the full statement: <a href="https://t.co/uQBjvq8ObU">https://t.co/uQBjvq8ObU</a><a href="https://t.co/4X2INbZj7Q">pic.twitter.com/4X2INbZj7Q</a></p>— Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoeingSpace/status/1422574713176481795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>“We’re disappointed with today’s outcome and the need to reschedule our Starliner launch,” John Vollmer, vice president and program manager for Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program, said. “Human spaceflight is a complex, precise and unforgiving endeavor, and Boeing and NASA teams will take the time they need to ensure the safety and integrity of the spacecraft and the achievement of our mission objectives.”</p><p>After its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-boeing-starliner-nasa-uncrewed-test-flight.html">first test flight went awry</a>, Starliner was supposed to return to space on<a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-clearled-july-30-test-flight-210541502.html"> July 30th</a>.
