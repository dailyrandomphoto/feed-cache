Perhaps unsurprisingly, even Chrome OS machines can get expensive when you start to spec them out, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Lenovo&#39;s Flex 5 Chromebook" href="https://amzn.to/3wcZ2W2">Lenovo&#39;s Flex 5 Chromebook</a> has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">one of our favorites</a> precisely for how much value it packs at a relatively affordable $430. Amazon now has this versatile Chrome OS laptop at the best price we&#39;ve seen — only $300. That&#39;s $130 off its normal price and an all-time low.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wcZ2W2" id="f335e64448da4c46a7c67e6c52bee178" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $300</a><p>The model on sale runs on a 10th-generation Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. While the latter two are pretty common in entry- to mid-level Chromebooks, the Core i3 processor will help this laptop feel zippier than others. While we initially weren&#39;t thrilled by the 4GB of RAM, we found that the Flex 5 Chromebook was more than capable of running multiple tabs simultaneously. As for storage, 64GB should be enough for most people who do most of their work in the Chrome browser anyway. Even at its normal price, the Flex 5 Chromebook provides a lot of power compared to other similarly priced devices — but at $300, it&#39;s a fantastic value.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most Chrome OS machines in this price range tend to sacrifice on style, and while Lenovo&#39;s laptop isn&#39;t ugly by any means, it&#39;s not the slickest either. It weights about three pounds and measures 0.66-inches thick, but it does have a handy convertible design so you could use it as a tablet or even in tent mode to watch TV shows and movies. It has a decent 1080p touchscreen, too, along with a decent array of ports that includes two USB-C ports and a USB-A port. Lenovo did a good job of combining most key features of a good Chromebook into this laptop, which is why we continue to recommend it both when it&#39;s on sale or at regular price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-is-on-sale-for-300-right-now-183046713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8185a6c0-1029-47d2-8d7f-a117aa6157a9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 18:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635876489</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T18:08:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Harry Potter: Wizards Unite' is shutting down on January 31st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Niantic is ending support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-harry-potter-wizards-unite-launch-hands-on.html"><em><ins>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</ins></em></a>.

After coming to nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-10th-anniversary-edition-skyrim-084030796.html"><ins>every system imaginable</ins></a>, Bethesda’s seminal 2011 RPG is about to get the tabletop treatment. Modiphius Entertainment, the company behind <a href="https://www.modiphius.com/fallout.html"><em><ins>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</ins></em></a>, is working on <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Battle-Dragons-Draugr-Trolls-and-More-as-You-Fight-to-Save-Skyrim-in-t"><em>The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim - The Adventure Game</em></a><em>. </em>Set to come out sometime next summer, the game will allow you to revisit Tamriel’s frozen north as an agent of the Imperial Blades. You can play either by yourself or with up to three other friends.</p><p>The narrative-driven game will ship with two campaigns made up of three chapters. Modiphius says each one should take about 90 to 120 minutes to complete. Provided you don’t get distracted by side quests and exploration (not an easy feat in any Elder Scrolls game), you can expect your initial playthrough to take about 12 hours. Worry not, you can “save” your progress at any point, and pick up where you left off. The decisions you make during a playthrough will shape how the story unfolds. And with a deck of about 600 cards driving the narrative, no two sessions should play out exactly the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you want to read more about the game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22757411/skyrim-board-game-campaign-price-release-date"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has a detailed preview.

The company has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/">announced</a> it&#39;s shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; You&#39;ll no longer be automatically recognized in photos if you opted in to the feature, and the Facebook team will delete over a billion facial recognition templates.

While Meta believed face recognition could still be helpful in some situations, such as gaining access to a locked account, it felt a &quot;narrower,&quot; more privacy-oriented approach was a better fit than the broader outgoing strategy. On-device recognition wouldn&#39;t require sharing data with outside servers, for example.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There was already significant pressure to shut down the system. Meta (then Facebook) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-facial-recognition-lawsuit-650-million-191451396.html">settled a privacy lawsuit</a> over facial recognition for $650 million in 2020, and it likely isn&#39;t eager to grapple with similar cases. Governments ranging from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/massachusetts-statewide-police-ban-facial-recognition-bill-064534909.html">Massachusetts</a> to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-parliament-facial-recognition-ban-ai-bias-165833826.html">European Union</a> have either passed or are strongly considering at least partial bans on facial recognition use. Facebook&#39;s opt-in system may not have explicitly run afoul of those laws, but the message is clear: wide-ranging facial recognition systems aren&#39;t very welcome.</p><p>As it stands, Meta isn&#39;t alone. Amazon now has an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rekognition-police-ban-222425615.html">indefinite ban</a> on police use of its Rekognition platform, and Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-google-hold-off-selling-facial-recognition-technology.html">declined to sell</a> facial recognition tech since 2018. Although Meta hasn&#39;t completely given up on the concept, it&#39;s clearly eager to be seen as forward-thinking — and continue mending its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tim-cook-privacy-cpdp-2021-slams-facebook-184333398.html">less-than-stellar reputation</a> for privacy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-shuts-down-face-recognition-171737198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">774cc24b-d5b3-42c9-bcfa-b4727bc4e71d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 17:17:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635874794</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T17:40:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/9be91600-ba1e-11e9-9c9e-5422a36fc275" width="3500" height="2275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/9be91600-ba1e-11e9-9c9e-5422a36fc275" width="3500" height="2275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015.

But folks might not be quite ready to give up on some of the luxuries they treated themselves to while they were cooped up in a private workspace. Perhaps you picked up a fancy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mechanical%20keyboard/"><ins>mechanical keyboard</ins></a>, but don&#39;t want to take it to the office, since the clacking might annoy your coworkers.</p><p>Perhaps with that in mind, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/razer/"><ins>Razer</ins></a> has a couple of new products in its Productivity lineup that might give you that enjoyable tactile typing and clicking sensation without infuriating those around you. The Pro Type Ultra wireless keyboard and new Pro Click Mini mouse have &quot;silent mechanical switches,&quot; which Razer says will offer a quieter experience wherever you&#39;re working from.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c0299990-3bf9-11ec-bbff-2ba22719d33c" style="height:3005;width:4583;" alt="Razer Pro Type Ultra keyboard." data-uuid="08057927-fc56-3120-92bb-a50042266956"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>The keyboard also has dampening foam to mitigate the sound, and Razer claims the keys will be good for up to 80 million presses. The fingerprint-resistant keycaps have a &quot;soft-touch coating for a luxurious, cushioned feel,&quot; according to the company. A wrist rest is included too.</p><p>Razer says you&#39;ll get up to 214 hours of use over Bluetooth and up to 207 hours of use via the low-latency Razer HyperSpeed Wireless connection before you need to recharge the keyboard. You can use it in wired mode over USB-C too. In addition, you&#39;ll be able to connect up to four devices and switch between them without having to re-pair them with a Pro Type Ultra.</p><p>If you&#39;re buying a new keyboard, you might want a matching mouse. As luck would have it, the Pro Click Mouse shares the Pro Type Ultra&#39;s white, dull-by-Razer-standards design. You can also pair the mouse (which isn&#39;t entirely silent <a href="https://www.razer.com/productivity/razer-pro-click-mini"><ins>based on an audio demo</ins></a> on Razer&#39;s website) with up to four devices.</p><p>There are a few scroll-wheel modes you can switch between depending on your current task. The free-spin mode is designed for zooming through long documents and webpages, tilt-click is geared toward horizontal scrolling and tactile mode is centered around more precise scrolling.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cefa7a20-3bf9-11ec-97ff-b31d30f17c23" style="height:1966;width:3466;" alt="Razer Pro Click Mini mouse" data-uuid="d0ffc457-a2f2-3529-a442-43d4e032bebf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>The mouse is rated for up to 15 million clicks. Razer claims you&#39;ll get up to 725 hours of battery life over Bluetooth and up to 465 hours via Razer HyperSpeed Wireless if you&#39;re using two AA batteries. There&#39;s an option to use only one battery if you&#39;d prefer to reduce the weight. If you decide to pick up both the keyboard and mouse, you can pair them to the same USB dongle to free up a port on your computer.&nbsp;</p><p>The new peripherals follow the Pro Type keyboard and Pro Click mouse Razer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-productivity-suite-keyboard-mouse-150056960.html"><ins>released in August 2020</ins></a>. Those devices had more muted designs than Razer&#39;s gaming-focused products to help them blend in a bit more.</p><p>The <a href="https://fave.co/3w8uQv2"><ins>$80</ins></a> Pro Click Mini is available now from Razer&#39;s website and other retailers. The Pro Type Ultra keyboard costs <a href="https://fave.co/3GFRMXo"><ins>$160</ins></a>, and will be available by the end of the year. Razer also introduced an enormous Pro Glide XXL mousepad with &quot;thick, high-density rubber foam,&quot; which will run you $30.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-productivity-keyboard-mouse-silent-mechanical-switches-pro-type-ultra-pro-click-mini-164230459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9d57c15-4f82-4d1e-b14c-a74f9f9e44f2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 16:42:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635871355</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T16:42:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Electronics Accessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/30a57cd0-3bf9-11ec-af1d-f08fc26b8d95" width="1465" height="824" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/30a57cd0-3bf9-11ec-af1d-f08fc26b8d95" width="1465" height="824" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer's Pro Type Ultra keyboard and Pro Click Mini mouse on top of the Pro Glide XXL mousepad.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Pro Type Ultra keyboard and Pro Click Mini mouse ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Music now offers synchronized transcripts for podcasts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify isn&#39;t the only one banking on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-automatically-transcribe-podcasts-accessbility-mobile-165029865.html">podcast transcripts</a> to reel you in.

They tend to be more expensive than some competing options, but if you’re patient, you can usually find them on sale. To that point, Amazon has discounted the <a href="https://amzn.to/3w6X8pR">black 1TB Touch model</a> from $190 to $150, matching the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-t7-portable-ssd-500gb-sale-amazon-133505208.html">previous all-time low price</a> for the SSD.  You can also get the silver colorway for less than MSRP, but it’s only discounted by $20. Additionally, the 2TB variant is $70 off, making it $300 currently. If you want to save an extra $10, the non-Touch model, which doesn’t include a built-in fingerprint sensor, is <a href="https://amzn.to/3EzQ08r">$140 at the moment</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3w6X8pR" id="8931f0984a344dcab7f4c9986eb31aa7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 Touch (1TB)">Buy Samsung T7 Touch (1TB) at Amazon - $150 </a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EzQ08r" id="6124459b94fe4ec8a089c8565df7b0b5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 1TB">Buy Samsung T7 (1TB) at Amazon - $140</a><p>Whether you go for the standard or Touch model, the T7 has a lot going for it. Both variants feature an aluminum outer casing that will protect the solid-state drive from drops. They also include ePCM technology and a Dynamic Thermal Guard feature to assist with heat management. When it comes to performance, the T7 can read files at up to 1,050 MB/s and write them at up to 1,000 MB/s. And while it only features a single USB-C port, the T7 comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables inside the box, allowing you to use it with almost any modern device, including some video game consoles. For those reasons, we think the T7 is a solid option for storing your photos and other important files.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-t7-touch-ssd-amazon-deal-155643217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a6788ae-df22-405a-8b1f-78fabacd509e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:56:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635868608</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T15:56:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/42d0bab0-3bf3-11ec-bbf7-a1146cd20671" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/42d0bab0-3bf3-11ec-bbf7-a1146cd20671" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's budget WH-CH710N ANC headphones drop back down to $78]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-early-black-friday-tech-deals-so-far-november-1-2021-amazon-best-buy-123511788.html"><ins>early Black Friday deals</ins></a> are popping up, and if you&#39;re looking to snag an entry-level set of active noise cancellation (ANC) headphones, you can&#39;t go too far wrong with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html"><ins>Sony&#39;s WH-CH710N</ins></a>.

Microsoft gave us a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-holograms-hololens-ar-vr-164001796.html">glimpse of its vision earlier this year with Mesh</a>, a platform for virtual meetings that can take place across HoloLens 2, mixed reality headsets, computers and smartphones. It&#39;ll be a while before we&#39;re stepping into meetings as holographic projections, though, so Microsoft is announcing something a bit more grounded: Mesh for Teams.</p><p>The pitch, as you&#39;d expect, combines the virtual environments and personas that Mesh delivers with Teams&#39; established workplace collaboration. Instead of hopping on a Teams meeting with your webcam, for example, you could pop up as a customized avatar that talks and animates along with your voice. Eventually, Microsoft plans to animate your avatar by following your face and movements with your webcam, something that should get even better as you step up to devices with more microphones, cameras and sensors like the HoloLens 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5511bff0-3bec-11ec-9dee-87727154e1c4" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Mesh for Teams large" data-uuid="4ab6e868-ec68-3d94-9bc3-f0cad94e1789"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>It&#39;s all about delivering that elusive sense of &quot;presence,&quot; the feeling that you&#39;re right beside your colleagues virtually. And while it may seem silly at first, Mesh for Teams could be a huge step forward for people who don&#39;t always feel comfortable on webcams. After all, there are plenty of times, like when you&#39;re working early in pajamas, or covered in your kids&#39; lunch mess, where you may be working but not exactly camera ready.</p><p>In addition to avatars, Mesh for Teams will also include pre-built immersive spaces to hang out virtually. That could let groups create a customized meeting space, much like an actual office. There&#39;s also the potential for those spaces to replicate hanging out in an office kitchen or water cooler. That seems a bit more fanciful, but it makes sense to experiment with virtual spaces. Having a virtual coffee chat with your avatar could end up being less stressful than flipping on your camera. Microsoft says companies will eventually be able to design spaces themselves, allowing them to reflect their actual offices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/551198e0-3bec-11ec-bb5f-8d453ce88f2b" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Mesh for Teams large" data-uuid="bc0bf28a-6be8-3220-af22-2916913a4f11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Mesh for Teams will start rolling out in 2022. Microsoft isn&#39;t giving up on its more expansive Mesh vision though: companies can still use that platform to create complex 3D environments, which workers can access through a variety of devices.</p><p>Alex Kipman, the Microsoft technical fellow who spearheaded the Kinect and HoloLens, originally pitched Mesh as a way for first-line workers to remotely collaborate on complex 3D models. Mesh for Teams boils that idea down for the typical knowledge worker, the sort of person who spends most of their day at a desk hopping between meetings, emails and office apps. It may not seem as exciting as Meta&#39;s pitch for a metaverse filled with multiplayer games and virtual events, but for many people, it&#39;s a far more useful way of thinking of a more connected internet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-for-teams-multiverse-work-150047792.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1c6efde-a70f-4b25-b597-f3bf7a29f592</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635865339</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T15:02:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55114ac0-3bec-11ec-a7ef-943a5eef1284" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55114ac0-3bec-11ec-a7ef-943a5eef1284" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mesh for Teams large]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mesh for Teams large]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop is a new Office app built for collaborative work]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Loop, a new Office collaboration app announced today, takes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-06-microsoft-fluid-framework-collaboration.html">company&#39;s Fluid Framework vision</a> one step further. You might remember that technology from Microsoft&#39;s recent developer events: It&#39;s  a way to collaborate on specific chunks of content, say a table or chart, synchronized across multiple Office apps. A table you create in Outlook, for example, would instantly update if someone plugs it into a Word document and adds new information. Up until now, we&#39;ve only seen that<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fluid-framework-office-online-outlook-160022166.html"> implemented in Office online as a sort of test</a>. Microsoft Loop is a far bigger bet on the future of document collaboration.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c874e0-3be2-11ec-9dff-fdeae9ef59b7" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Microsoft Loop" data-uuid="9cbbe3df-1193-3d48-9b36-65fce1e0ff32"><figcaption>Multiple people collaborating on a Fluid Framework poll.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Like Fluid Framework, one of the core parts of the new app are Loop Components, which Microsoft calls &quot;atomic units of productivity.&quot; They can include anything from as a list to a complex Dynamics 365 project, all of which will stay in sync when they&#39;re deployed in Office apps. You can organize your Components in Loop Pages, a new type of document that can also include files and links. Think of them like unstructured Word documents (or perhaps more like how people typically use Google Docs).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, there are Loop Workspaces, a way to view components and pages related to specific projects. According to Microsoft,  &quot;Workspaces make it easy for you to catch up on what everyone is working on, react to others’ ideas, or track progress toward shared goals.&quot;</p><p>If you&#39;re getting serious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-19-google-wave-opens-doors-to-public-asks-old-friends-for-new-chan.html">Google Wave</a> vibes from all of this, you&#39;re not alone. But Microsoft Loop sounds a bit more focused than that failed attempt at team collaboration. For one, the core idea of Fluid Framework makes sense. Now that we&#39;re all working across multiple documents online, it makes sense to have a way to synchronize elements within those files. Wave felt like a solution in search of a problem, whereas Microsoft Loop, despite its seeming complexity, addresses a growing problem many office workers face today.</p><p>Microsoft says it&#39;ll share more about Loop in the upcoming months. Until then, though, you can expect to see Loop components coming to Teams, Outlook, OneNote and other Microsoft 365 apps later this month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-loop-office-365-fluid-framework-150029033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4e9e7a5f-4e59-4450-b299-d167f37dab8e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635860923</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:48:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa84f90-3be2-11ec-af9a-39c4f9c9c66a" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa84f90-3be2-11ec-af9a-39c4f9c9c66a" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Video editing and audio recording are coming to Microsoft Office apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> is boosting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-2021-october-5-2021-170152304.html">Office</a> with some (arguably overdue) media creation tools. As part of a sweeping set of updates, the company is adding Clipchamp video editing to the Office suite. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-040823250.html">recently acquired</a> web-based tool helps you make &quot;professional-looking&quot; clips regardless of your skills. You can produce videos for your other Office projects, of course, but Microsoft also sees Clipchamp as a straightforward editing tool for personal footage.</p><p>It will also be much easier to add that professional sheen to your PowerPoint presentations. Microsoft is adding a &quot;recording studio&quot; to PowerPoint that lets you capture audio for those moments when you can&#39;t (or just don&#39;t want to) present live. You can annotate slides, customize the background and pick the view that will best help you record. When you&#39;re done, you can preview the presentation and re-record as much as necessary. Be patient for this feature, though, as Microsoft only expects it to become &quot;generally available&quot; in early 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other updates are subtler, but could be just as helpful in the right circumstances. Microsoft is trotting out Context IQ, a set of AI &quot;experiences&quot; for Microsoft 365 that will initially make situationally-aware recommendations in Editor. It will suggest relevant contacts when you want to tag people, for instance, or recommend meeting times when everyone is available.</p><p>Developers will also have a better reason to try Excel. Microsoft is introducing a JavaScript framework in the spreadsheet app that lets you create custom data types and functions using the web-based language. JavaScript will be available later in November in preview form. Many (if not most) Excel users won&#39;t have much need for this, but it could be valuable if your job revolves around data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-clipchamp-video-editing-150014886.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e52538aa-21d7-43cc-bc29-d8b09b509ccd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635863044</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aec386a0-3be2-11ec-b76f-d6b96a9a5498" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aec386a0-3be2-11ec-b76f-d6b96a9a5498" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Windows on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Word on a Surface Laptop in a collaborative work environment]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Word on a Surface Laptop in a collaborative work environment]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zoom starts showing ads to free users in limited test]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/zoom/"><ins>Zoom</ins></a> users on the free Basic plan may start seeing ads starting today.

It sounds counterintuitive, but think about it: A GPU often has an extreme amount of processing power sitting idle, so why not use that redundant hardware for other things?</p><p>Fortunately, NVIDIA is way ahead of us, and has already harnessed the potential of its own GPUs to do things beyond, well, graphics. For example, you might remember <a href="https://www.engadget.com/obs-nvidia-noise-removal-integration-184501842.html"><ins>RTX Voice</ins></a>, which as the name implies, is a tool for upping your microphone game. Then, it quietly released <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/"><ins>Broadcast </ins></a>— a more comprehensive tool aimed squarely at streamers and content creators. Both offer great audio enhancement features, but we’ll focus on Broadcast here as that has effectively (though not entirely) replaced RTX Voice.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Right up the top, I should set some expectations. While Broadcast offers some helpful tools for all streamers, the real benefit is for those with more entry-level gear. For example, if you have something like a Blue Yeti and an older webcam you’re going to get more out of this tool than someone with a Shure SM7B and a Sony A7.</p><p>Broadcast specifically “uses Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX GPUs to accelerate AI calculations so you can game, livestream and run AI networks at the same time.” It’s compatible with any RTX GPU — “GeForce RTX 2060, Quadro RTX 3000, or higher” — according to a company spokesperson.</p><p>If you don’t already own a compatible GPU, now isn’t exactly the best time to be looking for one, thanks to the ongoing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-tsmc-joint-chip-factory-200540698.html"><ins>chip shortage</ins></a>, but things do seem to be slowly easing up. If you <em>do</em> have a supported card then you can simply download the Broadcast app and get cracking. The better news is, if you have a Logitech headset or Blue mic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-adds-direct-logitech-headset-and-blue-microphone-support-140614960.html">as of today</a>, Broadcast is natively supported so you won’t even need to dive into the app.</p><p>Supported models at launch are Logitech&#39;s G733, Pro X and Pro X Wireless headsets, and Blue&#39;s Yeti X, Yeti Classic and Yeti Nano microphones. While that’s only a fraction of the companies’ offerings, it still represents a lot of headsets and microphones that today have new, untapped potential.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/57db73d0-3bd7-11ec-9ddd-12a570ddf312" style="height:435;width:851;" alt="NVIDIA Broadcast." data-uuid="ff5888c7-d9a6-37da-a9d0-c82c048ad6c6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA / James Trew</div></figure><p>The Logitech partnership, to date, only works with some products and only with some of the features on offer in NVIDIA Broadcast. Those looking for the full audio-visual featureset will still need to download the standalone app. Once you’re in Broadcast you’ll see three main tabs: Microphone, Speaker and Camera. We’ll focus mainly on the microphone section, but the other two are just as useful and it all combines into one hub for tweaking your stream, be it video, audio or both.</p><p>Under the Microphone tab you’ll find a drop down on the left to select your input source and a space below for adding effects. The area on the right is given over to a tool for testing these effects before you commit to them.</p><p>Right now, there are only two effects to choose from. But both are useful and there’s no novelty chaffe (get your robot voices elsewhere!). Broadcast is focused on shaping up your stream, not bending it into something else. And importantly, all in realtime, unlike something like iZotope RX which is incredibly good at repairing sound, but aimed at post production.</p><h2>Audio tools</h2><p>The first effect is Room echo removal. For anyone who has a space with less than favorable acoustics, this is going to help you dial down that dreaded “cave” sound you have probably been battling with. Reverb reduction is actually quite a science, given that you’re trying to remove elements of a sound that are… well, very very similar to the source. So you can’t just hack out the errant frequencies and be done with it, you need to leave the original signal intact.</p><p>NVIDIA kept things nice and simple. Other pro tools (like iZotope’s RX) give you an bevvy of settings and controls. Broadcast? Just two: on/off and “strength” (amount of reverb to be removed). To test this, I used a condenser microphone as those are most prone to picking up reverb. In the recording below, I start with no effect applied before dialling in about 50 percent and then finally with strength set to maximum.</p><div id="118174bd3c5d4dcfaeb260edcf6e13c0"><iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1337669500&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/sets/nvidia-broadcast-room-noise-removal-tests" title="NVIDIA Broadcast Room noise removal tests" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">NVIDIA Broadcast Room noise removal tests</a></div></div><p>As you can hear, the effect is, well, effective. The acoustics in the room I recorded the samples in aren’t terrible, but they’re definitely not optimal. But the difference between the raw recording and then with the reverb removed is stark. The effect is most obvious in the first recording with the condenser mic. The raw signal is… fine, but things are much improved with the echo removal tool set to around half way. The recording feels much more present and there’s no distracting room echo. More, isn’t always better though. Once I dial the effect up to 100 percent, reverb might be eliminated, but at the expense of the original signal. In short, play around with the settings to find the best balance for your tastes and recording space.</p><p>You’ll notice in the second recording that there’s not really all that much reverb to remove. This is thanks to the dynamic microphone which does a pretty good job of that itself. You can hear a difference once I start adding the effect, but it might not be worth the risk of degrading your source audio for such a minor benefit.</p><p>Perhaps more impressive than the echo removal is the second effect on offer: Noise reduction. While reverb tends to be a constant, outside noises are unpredictable. Things might be quiet when you sit down to record, only for a loud motorbike or barking dog to invade your stream moments later. Not with noise removal applied though.</p><p>This effect is impressively adept at removing anything but your voice from your stream. Be that a jackhammer, a crying baby next door or even a song played loudly on a speaker right by your microphone. Honestly, listen to the below.</p><div id="d54c9f2675b54cc98257df9dece9e108"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:400px;position:relative;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/hsF1fsN" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><p>Notice how you can’t hear the song when the effect is applied? That’s coming from a speaker barely a foot behind the microphone. When I recorded it, it’s fully audible to my ears, but almost entirely inaudible on the recording. I say <em>almost</em> as those with sharp ears might notice the odd fragment popping through, but you really have to listen closely. I actually asked NVIDIA about this and was given this response:</p><p>“The AI networks are trained to recognize some patterns, and as such there will be gray areas where the AI can have doubts. [...] As such we wanted to give our users flexibility to run the effects in a comfortable range, or dial things up in case they needed help in extreme situations. For example, for audio effects we recommend running them at 75-90 percent, depending on how much background noise or room echo there is.”</p><p>As mentioned, Broadcast largely replaced RTX Voice, but NVIDIA decided to patch it with support for NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPUs meaning you can still get the noise reduction tools even if your GPU doesn’t support Broadcast. Though, the company says, experiences will vary on older cards.</p><p>As with the reverb removal, the strength setting will ultimately impact the quality of the output so trial and error is needed to find the sweet spot. You might also want to consider time of day. If, for example, you live near a noisy road, you could dial in a second pair of settings for when you have to record around rush hour.</p><p>The noise removal filter is impressive, but it’s not without limitations. For one, the “strength” slider doesn’t seem to fade out sounds like music, instead it falls off only once you apply the maximum amount. At least in my testing. I doubt you’re intentionally streaming with music only you want to hear, so that’s a minor thing to be aware of, but if you <em>do </em>need to keep the strength at maximum, be aware of that degradation in signal which will get worse the more noise Broadcast is eliminating.</p><p>As a companion to the vocal effects, the middle tab in Broadcast is “Speakers.” We can sum this section in one shot: It’s the same as Microphone, just for incoming audio. That’s to say, you can go ahead and remove room echo or background noise from people you are speaking <em>with</em>. If you’ve ever been on a Zoom call during these pandemic times and someone’s baby starts crying or has a really loud road nearby, then you can selfishly spare your ears here.</p><h2>Camera tools</h2><p>Conceptually, the effects for your camera work in a similar way to the ones for your microphone. NVIDIA’s AI cores are “looking” out for noise or, depending, your entire background. Yup, with Broadcast you can achieve a green screen effect without the actual screen. You might be thinking “well, Zoom/Meet/TikTok does that” and you’d be right, but those don&#39;t do it nearly as well. Below is an example of what background removal/replacement looks like in Broadcast</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff50de20-3bd7-11ec-bb06-7627b6ed50c5" style="height:360;width:640;" alt="NVIDIA Broadcast." data-uuid="1ae4825e-081f-312f-9bc5-47da07da3349"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can definitely see where the effect isn’t perfect around my hair, but in general it works really well. I did notice that it struggled with the headrest on my chair, with the image flickering around that area as I moved around, but again, it’s leagues above what you might hope for from a free chat app.</p><p>In total, there are five effects for cameras. Three for your background: Blur, removal and replace (images or videos work!). Then there is Auto Frame, which crops in and then keeps your face in the center. Last, but not least, is Video noise removal — this is apt for recording in low light and your camera starts to go all grainy. You can see some examples in the picture below. Two were taken using a GoPro and the other pair are from an old DSLR repurposed as a webcam.</p><p>If you have good lighting, you probably won’t need the noise removal tool. But if your camera struggles with anything other than an abundance of photons, this filter can help. Again, as with the audio tools, be aware that more is not always better. I found with the effect applied at 100 percent you get the tell-tale “smoothing” that will tell your viewers that you’re papering over the cracks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1b22cbd0-3bd9-11ec-8e5f-b7dc9a25796e" style="height:1121;width:2000;" alt="NVIDIA Broadcast" data-uuid="e9da1be8-397a-34e0-bf99-4b6104ad3494"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The background tools, on the other hand, are a little more forgiving. The blur tool does a good job at obscuring the items behind you, but there’s a very unnatural contrast between you, in focus, and literally anything else in shot. This is similar to how iPhone “portrait” mode photos often appear. The background is blurred, but the subject looks unnatural as there’s almost no transition between foreground and background.</p><p>This is, of course, a benefit when you want to remove the background completely. With this filter, NVIDIA does a surprisingly good job of isolating you and deleting everything else. If you want to stream via OBS (or similar) with a game or video on screen while you play in the corner, this is the effect you want and no green screen required.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4b0fbca0-3bd8-11ec-adff-8b2f3f7c715a" style="height:793;width:2000;" alt="NVIDIA Broadcast." data-uuid="5c931ddc-886a-336d-823b-b6615b1e99f0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As seen above, NVIDIA does a much better job of removing the background than, say, Zoom or Google Meet does. There’s almost no bleed around hair or hands meaning your background rarely pokes through and spoils the green-screen illusion. Background replacement is essentially an extension of this effect with the option of choosing your own image or video to replace whatever happens to be behind you.</p><p>The last of the video effects is Auto-Frame which, as the name suggests, keeps you locked into the center of your shot. To do this, the video crops in a little bit and it uses the extra space to gently shift the video from left to right or vice versa as you move around. The movement isn’t jarring, it looks pretty smooth, and is a good way to make sure you don’t accidentally drift off to the side if you are a fidgeter (like me) and don’t keep still.</p><p>You can also combine these effects if you want. Auto-Frame can be stacked with either noise removal or one of the background effects for example, or you could use remove background with noise removal applied. Right now you can only stack two though, but that’s probably a good thing as all three at the same time might be a bit much.</p><p>The camera suite of effects is currently in beta, and NVIDIA has been adding new features and improving performance at a rapid pace. Version 1.2 in May integrated Broadcast into popular streaming apps like OBS, while the latest 1.3 version released in September added support for many virtual camera apps and made combining video effects much more viable by reducing their VRAM usage by 40 percent.</p><p>While performance and memory usage is never going to be an issue for those using Broadcast for their chats, one-PC streamers who are using the app while gaming will be grateful for the additional frames. Perhaps, one day, we can dare to dream about many other features such as multi-mic support (with different effects) live transcribing for closed captions and even smart detection of licensed music so your streams don’t flag a DMCA violation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-is-kinda-underrated-141026195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a8ecb42-16d4-449b-81e3-6560b9c67c63</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 14:15:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635862052</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:07:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66598400-3bd8-11ec-bc5f-d346603e0ac3" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66598400-3bd8-11ec-bc5f-d346603e0ac3" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Logitech puts NVIDIA Broadcast features directly into its headsets and Blue mics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you stream or do videoconferencing and own certain GeForce RTX GPUs, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-app-streamers-165218841.html">NVIDIA&#39;s Broadcast app</a> can be a magical helper. It uses a streamlined, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qblSdDZMmi0">AI-powered toolset</a> to remove background noise, add virtual effects, auto-frame shots and more. Now, Logitech has <a href="https://blog.logitech.com/2021/11/02/logitech-g-hub-nvidia-broadcast-integration-enters-open-beta/">announced</a> that it&#39;s incorporating some of those features directly into certain headsets and Blue microphones via a new beta, with no need to run any NVIDIA apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to a partnership between Logitech and NVIDIA, some of the Broadcast tools will be available through the G Hub drivers for the following products: Logitech G733 Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-blue-yeti-x-microphone-streaming-podcasting-recording.html">Blue Yeti X Microphone</a>, Blue Yeti Classic Microphone and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-28-blue-yeti-nano-usb-microphone.html">Blue Yeti Nano</a> Microphone.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d3b7b858379745a39694459a697df2dd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the full list of compatible Logitech G and <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueMicrophones?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlueMicrophones</a> devices: <br><br>G733 Gaming Headset <br>PRO X Gaming Headset<br>PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset<br>Yeti X Microphone<br>Yeti Classic Microphone<br>Yeti Nano Microphone</p>— Logitech G (@LogitechG) <a href="https://twitter.com/LogitechG/status/1455429903663255555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The drivers will make it possible for users to eliminate unwanted background noises and/or echo in a single click and clean up their mic signal. &quot;You can even test your mic signal to find the perfect settings for your set up,&quot; Logitech wrote. NVIDIA previously showed that it was possible to completely remove the sound of a hair dryer running in the background from your mic, so it&#39;s not just some minor noise reduction. It can also remove noise on the listener&#39;s end, like someone&#39;s clattering keyboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is now available to everyone via an open beta with the latest version of Logitech G Hub. You can also, of course, run NVIDIA Broadcast as a separate app that works with all of Logitech&#39;s audio products (or any other audio products, for that matter). The feature is supported on GeForce RTX 2060 and up GPUs, along with Quadro RTX 3000 and Titan RTX or higher.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-adds-direct-logitech-headset-and-blue-microphone-support-140614960.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5b27cd27-918f-4dfd-9ae8-e7608a3ab636</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 14:06:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635862079</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:08:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/eca3ff10-3bdb-11ec-bf12-3701b3edcbb4" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/eca3ff10-3bdb-11ec-bf12-3701b3edcbb4" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast adds direct Logitech headset and Blue microphone support]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast adds direct Logitech headset and Blue microphone support]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The McPlant tastes just like any McDonald's burger]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McDonald’s first plant-based burger (ignoring the veggie “burgers” that have come before it) finally goes on limited sale in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mc-donalds-trial-run-us-mcplant-164512755.html">US later this week</a>.</p><p>Following a brief trial in Canada in 2019, the McPlant has been on a wider tour of McDonald’s franchises in Europe. Ahead of its debut next week, I decided to try out the McPlant here in the UK, where it’s been available in selected restaurants for over a month. The TLDR review is that it tastes like... a McDonald’s burger.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ve had better (and worse) burgers, both plant and animal-based, but the launch itself is a major deal for the future of plant-based burgers in general. Whether you eat there or not, you can’t avoid the fact that this is the world’s biggest fast-food chain attempting a burger that tastes of meat — without using any meat.</p><p>McDonald’s is a little late to the plant-based patty party. In 2019, its rival Burger King started selling its own Impossible Whopper, recruiting Impossible Foods to help create a meat-free patty for its iconic menu item.</p><p>The launch wasn’t without issues though. Depending on location, the Impossible Whopper launched at roughly $1-2 dollars more than the beef-based original. (The chain eventually cut prices, due to slowing sales according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/burger-king-cuts-impossible-whopper-price-as-sales-taper-off?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.)</p><p>Then there was the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50486664">class-action lawsuit</a>, because the Impossible Whopper, while entirely plant-based, was being cooked on the same surfaces as meat and dairy products. A vegan customer said that ads that said &quot;100% Whopper, 0% Beef&quot;  were misleading. A Florida judge eventually dismissed the case, but not before it made headlines, and ensured that, from then on, Burger King stipulated that its plant-based Whopper was prepared on surfaces that came into contact with meat and dairy items, meaning that it was subsequently not vegan.</p><p>McDonald’s takes a similar approach on its corporate site, saying that the McPlant will be “cooked on the same grill as meat-based products and eggs“. In even more certain terms, the McPlant features American cheese and mayonnaise, which make it far from vegan-friendly.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e03c39d0-3bdc-11ec-b74f-6f2c7efcc7d5" alt="McDonald&#39;s McPlant plant-based burger " data-uuid="c83b136f-3449-37ae-823a-75dbcb7e40ce"><figcaption>The US McPlant comes with &quot;real&quot; American cheese.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">McDonald&#39;s</div></figure><p>However, McDonald’s UK and Ireland took three years to develop its own take on the McPlant, and it ticks the vegan box. Alongside the co-developed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-meatless-mcplant-171734231.html">Beyond Meat patty</a>, this particular McPlant comes in a vegan sesame bun, uses a pea-protein-based ‘cheese’ slice and a new vegan sauce that tastes somewhere between mayonnaise and the Golden Arches’ own burger sauce. (I really wish they’d given the sauce some kind of name, just to make it less... mysterious.) I think it&#39;s meant to be a mayonnaise substitute.</p><p>The new menu item has also been given the Vegetarian Society’s vegan accreditation, because on top of those recipe changes, here in the UK it is cooked and prepared separately to non-vegan products. For now, the US McPlant is neither vegan nor vegetarian and will come with a slice of American cheese and mayonnaise. The burger is also cooked on the same grill as meat - and egg-based products.</p><p>But back to my McPlant. With lettuce, tomato, pickles and that faux cheese slice, the UK version of the McPlant is more substantial than a standard McDonald’s cheeseburger.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e0567890-3bdc-11ec-8eef-18dd2a199202" alt="McPlant plant-based burger from McDonald&#39;s" data-uuid="3448fb2d-4fee-386a-bcaf-583a99922ac3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>From what I’ve been told, the composition and the Beyond Meat patty remain the same in the McDonald’s USA version. Like other high-end plant-based burgers given the mainstream treatment, it tastes meaty and the — I hate this word — mouthfeel tells my brain that I’m chewing on a McDonald’s burger.</p><p>The good thing about using plant-based meat substitutes in a burger is that the patty is just half the story. How it’s cooked, the toppings, the seasoning and the sauce add an awful lot (often more) to the flavors and textures.</p><p>Each bite is literally a cross-section of the entire burger, and so even if you think rival plant-based patties (like Impossible Foods’) are better than Beyond’s, once it’s cooked, stacked and in your hands, for most of us, a patty that’s marginally tastier is irrelevant.</p><p>Despite that, the burger itself does taste like a McDonald’s beef hamburger. So that’s a success. (I’m less sold on the fake cheese slice, but the majority of vegan cheese options taste terrible too, so not sure I can blame McDonald’s entirely here.)</p><p>The economies of scale are why the McPlant matters. Depending on how the US trial at eight restaurants fares, McDonald’s patrons might be willing to swap out their beef-based burger for a McPlant — if it tastes the part — and that could have a tangible effect on how much meat is both consumed by the public — and how much is farmed.</p><p>Halfway through eating the McPlant, I realized that it reminded me of a Burger King Whopper. (I can’t wait to read the comments after this.)&nbsp;</p><p>But I’m a Big Mac man, myself. Maybe a Big <em>MacPlant</em> is next?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-mc-plant-tastes-just-like-any-mc-donalds-burger-135059673.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">794d6dab-cd62-4cb4-84bf-4c8c923a6b8c</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 13:50:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635864228</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:43:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4c755860-3bde-11ec-9dff-3700c5175eed" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4c755860-3bde-11ec-9dff-3700c5175eed" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[McPlant]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[McPlant]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 512GB Mac Mini M1 returns to a record low of $750 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While we did not get an updated Mac Mini this year, the existing M1 desktop remains a good option if you want a compact machine with one of Apple&#39;s latest chips.

Tesla knows car manufacturers are required to issue recalls for any safety issues, the NHTSA said. It&#39;s not clear how Tesla responded to that inquiry before a November 1st deadline, but the company might now be in the habit of issuing recalls for software-related safety problems.</p><p>The notice highlights the changing nature of recalls. While recalls for hardware-only flaws haven&#39;t changed much (just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html">ask Chevy and LG</a>), software-related issues are another matter. Now that more and more cars accept over-the-air updates, it&#39;s possible for companies like Tesla to issue recalls for bugs they&#39;ve already fixed. Brands may have to make it particularly clear when a recall demands real-world service, as that might not always be clear going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-braking-recall-software-glitch-132442476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88b834ba-610f-482c-81d7-2c21421ae513</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 13:24:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635859485</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:24:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - OCTOBER 17, 2021 - A Tesla Model 3 is displayed at the Tesla Experience store in Joy City, Yantai, East China's Shandong Province, Oct 17, 2021.

The new homepage has an easy way to jump back into your last open tab, and it now contains your most recently saved bookmarks.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to go to the bookmarks menu or access your browsing history anymore, if you just want to access the last bookmarks you&#39;ve saved or viewed. If you have a Firefox account and also use the browser on desktop, your most recently saved bookmarks on desktop will also be added to the mobile homepage. Further, you can quickly access all your bookmarks by clicking Show All.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new homepage for Android also has the ability to group search queries by topic. Say, you&#39;re looking up things for an upcoming vacation — the browser now groups and lists the results you access instead of opening them in separate tabs. To keep things clean, those groups of information will only be available within 14 days. Speaking of keeping things clutter-free, the new Firefox will now mark tabs as &quot;inactive&quot; if you haven&#39;t visited them within the last 14 days. You can still go back to them after that, but they&#39;ll no longer clutter your view. Similar to topics grouping, this particular feature is only available on Android at the moment and will arrive on iOS in the coming months.</p><p>Finally, Mozilla is making Firefox&#39;s Pocket feed customizable. If you&#39;re on Android, you&#39;ll now be able to choose the topics of the stories you want to populate your feed. You&#39;ll still get Pocket stories on iOS, but the ability to customize topics isn&#39;t available for the platform yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/firefox-mobile-94-130040697.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f995210-1e96-40aa-8f78-24817574482b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635853168</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T11:39:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/f1b22f10-339d-11ea-bfbe-043cece2de90" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/f1b22f10-339d-11ea-bfbe-043cece2de90" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[stockcam via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[London, UK - July 31, 2018: The buttons of the internet browser app Firefox, surrounded by Safari, Firefox Focus, News and other apps on the screen of an iPhone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Firefox, Firefox Focus, Safari and other Apps on iPhone screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seven tech charities to support this holiday season]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s be honest, it’s been a rough <em>decade</em> at this point, and things seem to be getting worse rather than better. Online radicalization has seen many of the world’s political systems spin out of control to the point of uselessness. Climate change is a problem facing literally all of us that few in power seem interested in addressing. And our economic situation seems to be predicated on everyone buying lots of stuff all the time, despite the fact that most of the cost of living is swallowed up by housing. It’s<em> a lot</em>, and things can feel generally very bleak right now.</p><p>But, as the proverb says, it is always better to light a candle than it is to curse the darkness, so we’ve brought some matches. Today is a good time to try and make a positive impact in the world by backing organizations that can make the world a little better for all of us. That includes helping to better educate future generations, making life easier for kids who need serious medical care, or are in poverty, as well as addressing the climate crisis. This could never be an exhaustive list of good causes to donate to, but we’ve tried to pick out charities and non-profits whose general aims are probably already supported by Engadget readers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Able Gamers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c8a6d760-2dc4-11ec-9f7e-432c54b1c01c" alt="Tech Charities for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="81057cbc-5c71-303f-9db6-754893db4af5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Able Gamers</div></figure><p><em>Able Gamers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, EIN: 30-0533750.

It hasn&#39;t gone on sale like this in months, so now&#39;s the time to buy one if you&#39;ve been eyeing it for a while.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3waADjW" id="1804510b2527417a8ce73efa3d4dd309" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy August WiFi smart lock (4th gen) at Amazon - $180</a><p>August didn&#39;t mess with the good stuff when updating its WiFi smart lock. The fourth-generation device is smaller than the previous and it doesn&#39;t require a bridge thanks to its WiFi connectivity. Like most smart home devices, you&#39;ll follow a few setup videos in the companion mobile app to set the lock up, and during that process you&#39;ll have to turn on two-factor authentication. It&#39;s a necessary step and we were glad to see it as that extra layer of security is important for all connected devices — especially those that lock and unlock your home. And on top of that, the WiFi smart lock also has Bluetooth encryption plus AES 128-bit and TLS encryption.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After setting it up, August&#39;s device can be controlled from its companion app, allowing you to remotely lock and unlock your door. This lets you easily let friends and family members in when you&#39;re not home, and its Auto-Lock feature can detect when you&#39;ve shut the door and automatically secure it. And your old-school keys aren&#39;t suddenly useless either — you can still use them with the WiFi smart lock installed, so if you ever forget to replace the lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries, you can still get into your home.

From tools to tray liners, plus a range of rubs and sauces, the company will sell you everything you need for its grills to smoke a brisket or cook a few dozen wings. Now the company is expanding further to give you literally everything you might need for a full meal, with all of the dishes cooked directly from on its grills. <a href="https://provisions.traeger.com/">Traeger Provisions</a> is a HelloFresh-like meal kit that includes the meat, sides, rubs, sauces and more needed for a complete backyard feast that will feed crowds small and large.</p><p>At launch, the meat options are Wagyu beef brisket, Poulet Rouge chicken and Berkshire St. Louis pork ribs. Traeger says portion sizes for all three will accommodate 4-8 people, depending on the protein. For the brisket, the company also offers an option for 14-16 people (half brisket vs. whole brisket). With the smaller packages, you get the choice of two sides and four come with the big brisket feast. Right now, the options include three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon, collard greens with bacon and cornbread with spiced brown sugar. All of the side dishes come in “Traeger-ready” foil pans, so they’re good to go on the grill quickly. Prices range from $150 to $180 for the smaller packages, while the larger whole brisket box is $250. Shipping is an additional $10.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a1a60-3b82-11ec-9f7d-59bb974b5a0b" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="f2789456-d44e-3e63-ae4c-7cccdcb9a9a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Traeger is also preparing three holiday options for Thanksgiving. These Provisions boxes are more expensive at $220-$250, but the Heritage black turkey, naked turkey breast and rolled and trussed porchetta options will feed 8-10 people according to Traeger. They come with three side dishes instead of two and there are seasonal options like green bean casserole or apricot and bacon stuffing. The two turkey packages can also be upsized for 18-20 people for another $100.</p><p>Traeger is shipping the boxes anywhere in the US. As you might expect, all of this ships frozen and packed with dry ice. Since the meat and sides will be solid when they arrive, you’ll need to add a few days into your meal planning timeline, and the company offers detailed guidance on how to do exactly that as part of its cooking directions.</p><p>In addition to advice on the thawing process, Traeger includes all of the steps to prep the meat for the grill. That includes any trimming or seasoning that needs to be completed beforehand. The printed directions also guide you through the entire cook, with details on when to wrap (if necessary) and when to put the sides on the grill. It’s basically a paper-based version of Traeger’s app that offers step-by-step instructions with tons of recipes. If you need additional help, the directions have QR codes for videos and more info on tricky steps like trimming a brisket. There’s also guidance for how to prepare and cook the sides, including cooking bacon to mix in or topping a dish with bread crumbs before putting it on the grill. Lastly, supplies like rubs, sauces, pickled veggies, “pitmaster snacks,” gloves and butcher paper are all included. You literally just have to provide the grill and a bag of pellets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d95b321-3b82-11ec-99d7-1bbbdaaeb9a4" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c929b350-8af6-3369-9899-f5f3a741fcfb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I tested out Traeger Provisions with a Wagyu beef brisket Smokehouse Box. I selected the smaller size for 7-8 people, which included a six-pound Brisket, three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon and all of the aforementioned accoutrements. Even though I have experience with barbecue and Traeger’s recipes for its grills, I followed the Provisions directions closely, and the guidance was clear and easy for cooking on the Ironwood 650. I only deviated in an attempt to brown the breadcrumbs on the mac in the oven and popped the beans in there to keep them warm. Cooking steps helped with timing too, which can be difficult when you’re trying to have meat and sides all ready at the same time.</p><p>Obviously, the brisket was the star of the show. Mine was slightly dry as I have a tendency to over trim the extra fat, but that’s a me problem and not an issue with Traeger’s culinary tips. Still, the Wagyu beef was perfectly marbled so the fatty cuts were more forgiving to my butchering mistakes. Those remained quite moist and very tasty. Consensus among my family was that the mac and cheese was also a winner, with the herby, garlicky thick sauce serving as a great complement to the brisket. The baked beans we didn’t care for, but that’s likely because they were more what I’d call “barbeque beans” with a thinner sauce than the thick, molasses-tinged dish we’re used to in the Carolinas. I also enjoyed the “pitmaster snacks,” which included a smoked nut mix and smoked beef jerky.</p><p>The directions helped me time everything perfectly so we weren’t waiting on one thing to finish while the rest got cold. I think the portions are also accurately calculated. Eight servings would’ve been stretching it, but I could have easily gotten six or seven out of the half brisket box. The ribs option also seems okay in terms of portions, but the Poulet Rouge chicken might not. Four half chickens for 6-8 people seems like a stretch unless these are massively huge birds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a4170-3b82-11ec-970f-c7c82d8bde8f" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c518318f-c0be-3fc4-98fc-897f405349d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>So, who are these boxes for?  Most backyard cooks with some experience will likely have their go-to butcher or grocery store for proteins. They probably also have tricks for easy sides so they can focus on the meats. At $150, you’re definitely paying for convenience, in addition to high-quality beef, pork or poultry.</p><p>The ability to have everything you need in one box with detailed directions on how to prepare it can take some of the stress out of party planning. There is some lead time required though, so you can’t grab one of these on Tuesday for a cookout on Saturday. At the end of the day though, I don’t think that price is astronomical based on what Traeger is offering. Is it something you’ll do a lot? No. Will it come in handy in certain circumstances? Absolutely. I can see plenty of people being interested in having most of their Thanksgiving meal planning done with a few clicks.</p><p>I can also see Traeger Provisions serving as a great gift for new grill owners. Sure, it’s a considerable amount to spend on someone, but it would definitely help a novice get their feet wet with some step-by-step oversight. Plus, they might not have all the supplies they need yet — little things like butcher paper and gloves, for example.</p><p>Traeger is now taking orders for its Provisions boxes that will be delivered between November 10th and 14th. If you’re considering one of those Thanksgiving packages, you’ll need to order by November 14th to get it in time.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="484d0070-87f1-493d-ba2b-79963c895edb"/><p><strong>Update 12:44PM ET: </strong>This post has been updated to clarify Traeger&#39;s nationwide US shipping now that Provisions has officially launched.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/traeger-provisions-review-120027663.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d525cb7-8f4d-44b7-95de-46fc365ffc75</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635873332</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T17:15:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: '5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized disc]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blu-rays are so done.
