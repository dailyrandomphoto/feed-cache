'Reminiscence' promo uses deepfake tech to put you in the trailer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to see yourself on screen with Hugh Jackman, this is your chance. The promo for Warner Bros. upcoming <em>Reminiscence</em> movie uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucasfilm-hires-shamook-054904077.html">deepfake</a> technology to turn a photo of your face — or anybody&#39;s face, really — into a short video sequence with the star. According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/next-up/warner-bros-deepfake-movie-promo?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, a media startup called D-ID created the promo for the film. D-ID reportedly started out wanting to develop technology that can protect consumers against facial recognition, but then it realized that its tech could also be used to optimize deepfakes.</p><p>For this particular project, the firm created a <a href="https://www.bannisterandassociates.com/">website</a> for the experience, where you&#39;ll be asked for your name and for a photo. You can upload the photo of anybody you want, and the experience will then conjure up an animation for the face in it. The animation isn&#39;t perfect by any means, and the face could look distorted at times, but it&#39;s still not bad, considering the technology created it from a single picture.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Reminiscence</em> is a sci-fi thriller about Nick Bannister, a &quot;private investigator of the mind.&quot; The idea behind the promo is that you&#39;re a client looking into your memories to solve a case. The movie will be shown in theatres on August 20th, but like most new releases these days, it will also be available for streaming on HBO Max.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d22650-fcbf-11eb-b557-b55ae3f25f9a" style="height:465;width:800;" alt="Reminiscence" data-uuid="058a5161-e976-3768-b845-6795518f9c54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-reminiscence-promo-deepfake-trailer-052114554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c509528e-e1fd-4c73-ab83-ce16064c0c97</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 05:21:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628918539</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T05:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple clarifies its sex abuse scans would look for 'images flagged in multiple countries']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple, which basked in praise from many corners after refusing to cooperate with federal authorities <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-16-judge-tells-apple-to-help-fbi-access-san-bernardino-shooters-ip.html">following the 2016 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California</a>, is now aggressively walking back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html">its plans to unilaterally scan customers&#39; phones for child porn</a> on behalf of governments following a swift and furious backlash from privacy advocates. Per a Friday afternoon report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-criticism-apple-only-seek-abuse-images-flagged-multiple-nations-2021-08-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the tech company clarified that it will only utilize its proposed  system to look for images that have already &quot;been flagged by clearinghouses in multiple countries.&quot;</p><p>An initial threshold of 30 images would have to be discovered before the automated scanning system alerted Apple that an actual human should review the issue, though the company explained that the figure would eventually be reduced in the future.

Apple did assert that the program was &quot;still in development&quot; and that mulligans like this were a normal part of the production process.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of scanning user accounts for contraband images is old hat for the tech industry, however Apple&#39;s plan to install the monitoring software directly on the hardware itself is an unprecedented move — one that has privacy advocates up in arms.

On Friday, a federal judge with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary decision related to a complaint the company had filed against Google in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html">early 2020</a>, alleging the search giant had infringed on five of its patents. Validating all five claims, the judge said Google should not be allowed to import devices that violate the intellectual property of Sonos.</p><p>&quot;Today the ALJ has found all five of Sonos&#39; asserted patents to be valid and that Google infringes on all five patents. We are pleased the ITC has confirmed Google&#39;s blatant infringement of Sonos&#39; patented inventions,&quot; said Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus. &quot;This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"><em>The New York Times</em> notes</a>, the judge&#39;s decision isn&#39;t final. The entire ITC body has to make a final ruling before it mandates any remedial measures. With a meeting scheduled for December 13th, that won&#39;t happen for another few months.</p><p>&quot;We do not use Sonos&#39; technology, and we compete on the quality of our products and the merits of our ideas,&quot; said Google spokesperson José Castañeda. &quot;We disagree with this preliminary ruling and will continue to make our case in the upcoming review process.&quot;</p><p>Sonos first sued Google in early 2020. It accused the company of copying some of the technologies most critical to its speakers, including its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-29-sonos-trueplay-calibration.html">Trueplay tuning tool</a>. In patent disputes, companies typically use simultaneous ITC complaints to force the hand of their opponent since the body tends to resolve matters faster than a traditional court. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-sonos-patent-infringement-132548465.html">subsequently countersued Sonos</a>, claiming the company had been using its search, software, networking and audio processing technologies without paying the proper licensing fees. The feud escalated later that same year when Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-sues-google-190303052.html">filed a second suit</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-google-itc-compliant-initial-ruling-220232437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9b37ba3-8bd5-476f-ba33-e64b9b220508</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 22:02:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628892156</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T22:02:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/d3bd76c0-0284-11eb-befd-f2cd9543829b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/d3bd76c0-0284-11eb-befd-f2cd9543829b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sonos Arc]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Arc]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sonos may be building its own voice assistant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Out of the box, modern Sonos speakers support Alexa and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-google-assistant-sonos.html">Google Assistant</a>, and in a roundabout way Siri as well. Between those options, you might think Sonos would be covered when it comes to voice-activated assistants, but the company may be working on a solution of its own.

It also points to the privacy benefits of such a setup. “Sonos Voice Control interprets your voice entirely on the speaker, so no audio is sent to the cloud, stored, transcribed, or listened to by anyone,” the company says in the survey.  We’ll note here Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-20-sonos-buys-snips-to-improve-voice-control.html">bought a startup</a> that specialized in fast and private on-device voice processing in 2019.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Sonos spokesperson told <em>The Verge </em>the company frequently collects feedback from its customers, but that it had no additional information to share<em>. </em>If Sonos plans to release its own voice assistant, it’s not hard to understand its motivations. After spending at least a year to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-google-assistant-sonos.html">get Assistant on its devices</a>, the company had a very public falling out with Google in 2020, culminating in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-sues-google-190303052.html">ongoing legal spat between the two</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-survey-210304633.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4e66feea-d7cb-4199-b442-e597da626573</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 21:03:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628892609</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T22:10:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e155f50-fc82-11eb-bb2f-d3aa96ee2af5" width="840" height="560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e155f50-fc82-11eb-bb2f-d3aa96ee2af5" width="840" height="560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Jason Voorhees]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sonos Friday the 13th]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Friday the 13th]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has paused verification applications again]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stop us if you’ve heard this one before, but Twitter has once again temporarily stopped accepting new verification applications from users.

In a <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/">post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623354/facebook-instagram-algorithm-watch-research-legal-threat"><em>The Verge</em></a>, AlgorithmWatch claims the company accused it of breaching Instagram’s terms of service and said it would move to take “more formal engagement” if the project did not “resolve” the issue.</p><p>AlgorithmWatch’s research centered around a browser plugin more than 1,500 individuals downloaded. The tool helped the team to collect information it says allowed it to make some inferences about how Instagram prioritizes specific photos and videos over others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most notably, the team found the platform <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-nudity/">encourages people to show skin</a>. Before publishing its findings, AlgorithmWatch said it had reached out to Facebook for comment, only for the company not to respond initially. However, in May 2020, Facebook told the researchers their work was “flawed in a number of ways” after it said earlier in the year it found a list of issues with the methodology AlgorithmWatch had employed.</p><p>When Facebook accused AlgorithmWatch of breaching its terms of service, the company pointed to a section of its rules that prohibits automated data collection. It also said the system violated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-04-who-controls-your-data.html">GDPR</a>, the European Union’s data privacy law. “We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,” AlgorithmWatch said. “In other words, users of the plugin [were] only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.” As for Facebook’s allegations related to GDPR, the group said, “<a href="https://github.com/algorithmwatch/tami-tools/blob/main/backend/data_donors/serializers.py#L88-L89">a cursory look at the source code</a>, which we open-sourced, shows that such data was deleted immediately when arriving at our server.”</p><p>Despite the belief they had done nothing wrong, the researchers eventually decided to shutter the project. “Ultimately, an organization the size of AlgorithmWatch cannot risk going to court against a company valued at one trillion dollars,” they said.</p><p>When Engadget reached out to Facebook for comment on the situation, the company denied it had threatened to sue the researchers. Here’s the full text of what it had to say:</p><blockquote><p>We believe in independent research into our platform and have worked hard to allow many groups to do it, including AlgorithmWatch — but just not at the expense of anyone’s privacy. We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns. We did not threaten to sue them. The signatories of this letter believe in transparency — and so do we. We collaborate with hundreds of research groups to enable the study of important topics, including by providing data sets and access to APIs, and recently published information explaining how our systems work and why you see what you see on our platform. We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don’t put people’s data or privacy at risk.</p></blockquote><p>This episode with AlgorithmWatch has worrisome parallels with actions Facebook took earlier in the month against a project called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html">NYU Ad Observatory</a>, which had been studying how political advertisers target their ads. Facebook has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-researcher-api-fringe-groups-195545901.html">some tools in place</a> to assist researchers in their work, but for the most part, its platforms have been a black box since the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. That’s a significant problem, as AlgorithmWatch points out.</p><p>“Large platforms play an oversized, and largely unknown, role in society, from identity-building to voting choices,” it said. “Only if we understand how our public sphere is influenced by their algorithmic choices, can we take measures towards ensuring they do not undermine individuals’ autonomy, freedom, and the collective good.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/algorithmwatch-facebook-shutdown-184729493.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42eab110-cc7a-4b65-9e01-43a19e6ff893</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 18:47:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880453</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:47:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5fea3070-fc62-11eb-bddb-f95f014d45bc" width="3500" height="2262" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5fea3070-fc62-11eb-bddb-f95f014d45bc" width="3500" height="2262" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee writes a note on the message board at the new headquarters of Facebook in Menlo Park, California January 11, 2012.

But with the Delta variant’s rapid spread threatening to send the country back into another round of social isolation, state and local governments (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/vaccine-mandates-proof">and numerous businesses</a>) are seeking to strike a balance between <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-to-become-second-U-S-city-to-16382500.php">the public’s health and the nation’s economic needs</a> through the use of digital vaccine cards, aka “vaccine passports.” But, unlike the mRNA vaccine itself, these passports are not quite the magic bullets against COVID we had hoped.</p><p>Vaccine passports, either physical or digital records certifying that a person has been fully vaccinated against a disease, have been around <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/04/08/985032748/the-vaccine-passport-debate-actually-began-in-1897-over-a-plague-vaccine">since the 19th century</a>. As early as the 1880s, students and educators in the US were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-apps.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock">required to show proof of immunization against smallpox</a> before attending classes. In 1897 Russian scientist Waldemar Haffkine developed a vaccine against the bubonic plague. His breakthrough treatment was immediately put to use by the British colonizers of India. To help ensure that densely populated Hindu and Muslim pilgrimage sites in the country did not mutate into outbreak clusters of the disease, the local government began requiring proof of vaccination by every pilgrim before entering these sites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the rise of air travel in the second half of the 20th century, the United Nations adopted similar rules in 1951 and then again in 1969, dubbed the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations">International Health Regulations</a>. These regulations, along with widespread outbreaks of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/index.html#:~:text=Yellow%20fever%20is%20a%20very,person&#39;s%20symptoms%2C%20and%20travel%20history.">yellow fever</a>, led to the advent of “yellow cards,” which international travellers have carried for decades to certify their immunization against a wide variety of infectious diseases.</p><p>Yellow fever is currently the only disease currently on the IHR for which countries can demand vaccination proof as a condition of entering the country, though the UN’s regulations on any disease are advisory and non-binding in nature so the responsibility for adhering to and implementing those rules falls to individual nations.</p><p>In response to the COVID pandemic, many nations already have embraced a new generation of vaccine passports. Israel has the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-vaccinations.html">Green Pass</a>, Denmark has the <a href="https://en.coronasmitte.dk/corona-passport">Coronapas</a>, the European Union (but not the UK) offers the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57665765">EU Digital Covid Certificate</a>, China rolled out its vaccine passport <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-rolls-out-vaccine-passport">as a WeChat mini app in March</a>, and Estonia uses <a href="https://guardtime.com/vaccineguard">VaccineGuard</a>. Even private businesses are considering implementing their own systems. United, JetBlue and Lufthansa, for example, are rolling out CommonPass, a system designed to verify an international passenger’s COVID testing and vaccination status.</p><p>“This is likely to be a new normal need that we’re going to have to deal with to control and contain this pandemic,” Dr. Brad Perkins, chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, the nonprofit that developed CommonPass, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-apps.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock"><em>The New York Times</em></a> in December.</p><p>The Biden administration has made clear that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/white-house-says-u-s-won-t-issue-vaccine-passports">it does not support the creation of a vaccine passport program at the Federal level</a>. The President did, however, issue an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-promoting-covid-19-safety-in-domestic-and-international-travel/">executive order in January</a> directing the State Department to work with the WHO and international aviation and travel agencies to develop standards for post-pandemic travel.</p><p>“The federal government is working on this issue of vaccine credentialing or vaccine verification or what some people call vaccine passports. So we’re going to be following carefully what the federal government comes out with,” Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, told the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/New-York-allows-them-Florida-bans-them-Will-16073145.php"><em>SF Chronicle</em></a> in April. “If they don’t move fast enough, we will come out with technical standards of what we expect and also really focusing on making sure that that privacy is protected and that equity is protected.”</p><p>Instead, Americans are offers a hodgepodge of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-san-francisco-d527b25676d5f450bb7042eb8c32534d">local and state regulations</a>, at least those states that haven&#39;t banned certification systems — looking at you, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/which-states-have-banned-vaccine-passports">Arkansas, Texas, Florida, and Indiana</a> — despite clear legal precedent affirming the government’s authority to temporarily abridge certain individual rights during a public health crisis (see: <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/"><em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em></a>).</p><p>Take California, for example. The Golden State recently rolled out the <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a>, a system that securely pulls the data stored in the California immunization registry. It’s the same state-collected vaccination data that is seen on the paper cards issued when you got your shots — specifically your name, date of birth, vaccination dates, and vaccine manufacturer.</p><p>“It’s not a passport. It’s not a requirement. It’s just the ability now to have an electronic version of that paper version,” California Governor Gavin Newsom explained during a press conference announcing the system’s rollout in June.</p><p>The system can also store a scannable QR code on your mobile device so that businesses and venues that do require certification of full vaccination prior to entry can do so easily. The QR code is built on the non-profit <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">SMART Health Card</a> technology, which means that only SMART-compatible scanners can actually read the codes. And <a href="https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-require-proof-vaccination-entry-certain-indoor-businesses-and-all-large-indoor">in San Francisco, that’s literally all of them</a>. This is a built-in security feature ensuring that some random clown at the bar can’t surreptitiously scan your code using the generic QR reader on their phone and get access to your information.</p><p>However, the system’s rollout has not been without its hiccups. This reporter specifically has spent the past six weeks attempting to resolve an issue with incomplete vaccination data being reported to the registry. (Basically, it reads that my second dose is the only dose I received.) The CDPH declined to comment on how many Californians have registered for the service and how many of those registrants have run into similar problems, though the agency has set up a <a href="https://chat.myturn.ca.gov/?id=17">virtual agent</a> to help guide users through the process of alerting the state to any mistakes or omissions.</p><p>New York, on the other hand, has not one but two competing vaccine verification systems, neither of which has proven particularly reliable, trustworthy or useful. At the state level, you’ve got the Excelsior Pass, which operates in a similar fashion to California’s DCVR system — pulling immunization data directly from the state’s registry — and leverages IBM’s proprietary blockchain technology to maintain data security and user privacy. At the local level, New York City has rolled out a passport app of its own, dubbed the NYC COVID Safe App, which for all intents and purposes is a half-assed image storage app that is ridiculously easy to spoof.</p><div id="ec5ee8ed48b04662a395470ff81247f8"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I explained to <a href="https://twitter.com/WNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WNYC</a> today, New York City&#39;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYCCovidSafe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NYCCovidSafe</a> app isn&#39;t exactly cutting edge technology.

Since the app doesn’t independently verify any of the information it is displaying, instead relying on bar, venue and restaurant staffers to make the determination as to whether a photo is legitimate or not, malicious users could easily upload a photo of any vaccine card — whether it’s been photoshopped, acquired from a friend or bought on on the black market (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-education-fake-vaccination-cards-8c4ca2b4d54434c2fc022b34087df8cb">for $400</a>).</p><p>The state-run Excelsior Pass has run into <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2104289">privacy issues</a> of its own. For one, its reliance on IBM’s blackbox blockchain system provides virtually no accountability or transparency in how the system actually operates.</p><p>The “thing is highly engineered, it has all these layers of registration, verification, and a customized QR code,” Cahn said. “That&#39;s raising far more important privacy issues because the state is quite clear that it doesn&#39;t use location services. But since each scanner is registered to a specific business address, every time you scan that QR code, the state and IBM are collecting a record of where you were and when, and we haven&#39;t done any clear information on how long that data is retained.”</p><p>What’s more, an experiment conducted in April by Cahn found that even with the blockchain assurances, the app was remarkably easy to hack. “After getting consent from an Excelsior Pass user, I tried to download their pass, logging into their account using nothing more than public information from social media. Eleven minutes after he gave me the greenlight, I had a copy of his blue Excelsior Pass in hand, valid for use until September,” Cahn wrote for the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-forged-new-yorks-digital-vaccine-passport-in-11-minutes-flat"><em>Daily Beast</em></a>.</p><p>“This city app really just speaks to the dysfunction. Here in New York, the rivalry between the city and state, the fact that we have a mayor and the governor who can&#39;t stand each other, and it is not addressing a technical need,” he lamented. “These apps are such a debacle that we just need to go back to old-fashioned paper records.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/these-vaccine-passports-are-why-we-can-have-nice-things-180018254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0941660f-cf43-4c3f-858a-112bf9d2cd19</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 18:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880288</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:45:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/109a12c0-72d7-11eb-bfdf-a67ba0167c7c" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/109a12c0-72d7-11eb-bfdf-a67ba0167c7c" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LEREXIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[a series of photos showing a mobile application with a QR code showing a health passport for covid-19]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[QR code for verification of immunization after vaccination with covid vaccine - 19]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls’ will soon be revived on Apple Arcade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new(ish) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/castlevania"><ins>Castlevania</ins></a> game is on the way to Apple Arcade. <em>Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls </em>is coming soon to iOS, tvOS and Mac via the subscription service.

Thankfully, almost everything you need to know about the car is in its model designation: LPI 800-4. The first part is short for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, referencing how the powertrain is mounted lengthwise toward the back of the supercar and the fact that it&#39;s a hybrid. Meanwhile, the two numbers point to the approximately 802 horsepower the Countach&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-lamborghini-sian-hybrid-technology-interview.html">V12 6.5-liter engine</a> and 48-volt electric motor can output together, as well as the fact that it has four-wheel drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e0dbabf0-fc53-11eb-bf3f-9ef15cf71548" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" data-uuid="5989dadc-a19b-37b8-9284-658f816c4ba7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>All of that makes for one powerful car. The Countach can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds and zero to 124 miles per hour in just under nine seconds. As for a top speed, you can push it to 221 miles per hour, and it has a maximum torque of 531 lb-ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0f7e9b20-fc54-11eb-87f9-0ad0a427852c" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach cockpit" data-uuid="8d1554f6-f008-3ffa-8360-e9521052c163"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>Powering the Countach&#39;s electric motor is a supercapacitor Lamborghini claims delivers three times more power compared to a lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The automaker says it mounted the electric motor directly to the gearbox to preserve the feeling of power transfer you get from a V12 engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Carbon fiber makes up most of the chassis and exterior of the Countach LPI 800-4. &quot;It imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade,&quot; Lamborghini says of the design, which is more reminiscent of the Aventador than its original namesake. Inside, you&#39;ll find an 8.4-inch touchscreen display that includes CarPlay integration and a button labeled &quot;Stile.&quot; Pressing it &quot;explains the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3d4b75a0-fc54-11eb-ab2b-040a245611d6" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" data-uuid="076479b9-68b5-3c95-8c5d-e3cecc63e4ba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>Speaking of a privileged audience, Lamborghini will only make 112 units of the Countach LPI 800-4.

Faced with a rising tide of viral rumors and conspiracy theories, the company said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html"><ins>start removing</ins></a> vaccine mistruths from its platform. Notably, the effort not only encompassed content about COVID-19 vaccines, but all vaccines. That includes many of the kinds of claims it had long allowed, like those linking vaccines and autism, statements that vaccines are “toxic” or otherwise dangerous.</p><p>The move was widely praised, as disinformation researchers and public health officials have long urged <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> and other platforms to treat vaccine misinformation more aggressively. Since then, the company has banned some prominent anti-vaxxers, stopped recommending health-related groups and shown vaccine-related PSAs across Facebook and Instagram. It now labels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/facebook-to-label-all-covid-19-vaccine-posts-with-pointer-to-official-info/"><ins>any post at all</ins></a> that mentions COVID-19 vaccines, whether factual or not.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yet, despite these efforts, vaccine misinformation is still an urgent problem, and public health officials say Facebook and other social media platforms aren’t doing enough to address it. Last month, the Surgeon General issued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html"><ins>an advisory</ins></a> warning of the dangers of health misinformation online. The accompanying 22-page report didn’t call out any platforms by name, but it highlighted algorithmic amplification and other issues commonly associated with Facebook. The following day, President Joe Biden made headlines when he said that misinformation on Facebook was “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html"><ins>killing people</ins></a>.”</p><p>While Facebook has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/"><ins>pushed back</ins></a>, citing its numerous efforts to quash health misinformation during the pandemic, the company’s past lax approach to vaccine misinformation has likely made that job much more difficult. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said vaccine hesitancy has decreased among its users in the US, but the company has also repeatedly rebuffed requests for more data that could shed light on just how big the problem really is.</p><p>“Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have removed 18 million pieces of COVID misinformation, labeled hundreds of millions of pieces of COVID content rated by our fact-checking partners, and connected over 2 billion people with authoritative information through tools like our COVID information center,” a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget. “The data shows that for people in the US on Facebook, vaccine hesitancy has declined by 50% since January, and acceptance is high. We will continue to enforce against any account or group that violates our COVID-19 and vaccine policies and offer tools and reminders for people who use our platform to get vaccinated.”</p><h2>Facebook’s pandemic decision</h2><p>Throughout the pandemic, Facebook has moderated health misinformation much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-covid-forced-social-media-misinformation-reckoning-150051622.html"><ins>more aggressively</ins></a> than it has in the past. Yet for the first year of the pandemic, the company made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-covid-forced-social-media-misinformation-reckoning-150051622.html"><ins>a distinction</ins></a> between coronavirus misinformation — e.g., statements about fake cures or disputing the effectiveness of masks, which it removed — and vaccine conspiracy theories, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-173021562.html"><ins>it said</ins></a> did not break the company’s rules. Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vaccine-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-9eae01a2-e6b2-4f4c-a48c-986bac665a2b.html"><ins>even said</ins></a> that he would be reluctant to moderate vaccine misinformation the same way the company has with COVID misinformation.</p><p>That changed this year, with the advent of COVID-19 vaccines and the rising tide of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy that accompanied them, but the damage may have already been done. A peer-reviewed study published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01056-1"><ins>in </ins><em><ins>Nature</ins></em></a> in February found that exposure to misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines “lowers intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine” by about 6 percent.</p><p>People are also more likely to be unvaccinated if they primarily get their news from Facebook, according to <a href="https://osf.io/uvqbs/"><ins>a July report</ins></a> from the COVID States Project. The researchers sampled more than 20,000 adults in all 50 states and found that those who cited Facebook as a primary news source were less likely to be vaccinated. While the authors note that it doesn’t <em>prove </em>that using Facebook affects someone’s choice to get vaccinated, they found a “surprisingly strong relationship” between the two.</p><p>“If you rely on Facebook to get news and information about the coronavirus, you are substantially less likely than the average American to say you have been vaccinated,”<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/27/people-are-more-anti-vaccine-if-they-get-their-covid-19-news-facebook-rather-than-fox-news-new-data-shows/"><ins> they write</ins></a>. “In fact, Facebook news consumers are less likely to be vaccinated than people who get their coronavirus information from Fox News. According to our data, Facebook users were also among the most likely to believe false claims about coronavirus vaccines.”</p><p>The researchers speculate that this could be because people who spend a lot of time on Facebook are less likely to trust the government, the media or other institutions. Or, it could be that spending time on the platform contributed to that distrust. While there’s no way to know for sure, we do know that Facebook has for years been an effective platform for spreading disinformation about vaccines.</p><h2>A spotty record</h2><p>Doctors and researchers have warned for years that Facebook wasn’t doing enough to prevent lies about vaccines from spreading. Because of this, prominent anti-vaxxers have used Facebook and Instagram to spread their message and build their followings.</p><p>A report published earlier this year from the CCDH found that more than half of all vaccine misinformation online could be linked to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html"><ins>12 individuals</ins></a> who are part of a long-running, and <a href="https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_00b2ad56fe524d82b271a75e441cd06c.pdf"><ins>often coordinated</ins></a>, effort to undermine vaccines. But while the company has banned some accounts, some of those individuals still have a presence on a Facebook-owned platform, <a href="https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_6946cb0059624ec093a427552b1b2bc3.pdf"><ins>according to</ins></a> the CCDH. Facebook has disputed the findings of that report, which relied on analytics from the company&#39;s CrowdTangle tool. But the social network’s own research into vaccine hesitancy indicated “a small group appears to play a big role” in undermining vaccines, <em>The Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/14/facebook-vaccine-hesistancy-qanon/"><ins>reported</ins></a> in March.</p><p>There are other issues, too. For years, Facebook’s search and recommendation algorithm have made it extraordinarily easy for users to fall into rabbit holes of misinformation. Simply searching the word “vaccine” would be enough to surface recommendations for accounts spreading conspiracy theories and other vaccine disinformation.</p><p>Engadget reported<a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-173021562.html"><ins> last year</ins></a> on Instagram’s algorithmic search results associated anti-vaccine accounts with COVID-19 conspiracies and QAnon content. More than a year later, a recent study <a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/fb_algorithm_antivaxx/"><ins>from Avaaz</ins></a> found that although this type of content no longer appears at the top of search results, Facebook’s recommendation algorithms continue to recommend pages and groups that promote misinformation about vaccines. In their report, researchers document how users can fall into misinformation “rabbit holes” by liking seemingly innocuous pages or searching for “vaccines.” They also found that Facebook’s page recommendation algorithm appeared to associate vaccines and autism.</p><blockquote><p>“Over the course of two days, we used two new Facebook accounts to follow vaccine-related pages that Facebook suggested for us. Facebook’s algorithm directed us to 109 pages, with 1.4M followers, containing anti-vaccine content — including pages from well-known anti-vaccine advocates and organizations such as Del Bigtree, Dr. Ben Tapper, Dr. Toni Bark, Andrew Wakefield, Children&#39;s Health Defense, Learn the Risk, and Dr. Suzanne Humphries. Many of the pages the algorithm recommended to us carried a label, warning that the page posts about COVID-19 or vaccines, giving us the option to go directly to the CDC website. The algorithm also recommended 10 pages related to autism — some containing anti-vaccine content, some not — suggesting that Facebook’s algorithm associates vaccines with autism, a thoroughly debunked link that anti-vaccine advocates continue to push.”</p></blockquote><p>Facebook has removed some of these pages from its recommendations, though it’s not clear which. Avaaz points out that there’s no way to know why Facebook’s recommendation algorithm surfaces the pages it does as the company doesn’t disclose how these systems work. Yet it’s notable because content associating vaccines with autism is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"><ins>exactly</ins></a> one of the claims that Facebook said it would ban under its stricter misinformation rules during the pandemic. That Facebook’s suggestions are intermingling the topics is, at the very least, undermining those efforts.</p><h2>Claims and counterclaims</h2><p>Facebook has strongly opposed these claims. The company repeatedly points to its messaging campaign around covid-19 vaccines, noting that more than 2 billion people have viewed the company’s COVID-19 and vaccine PSAs.</p><p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> responding to President Biden’s comments last month, Facebook’s VP of Integrity Guy Rosen argued that “vaccine acceptance among Facebook users in the US has increased.” He noted that the company has “reduced the visibility of more than 167 million pieces of COVID-19 content debunked by our network of fact-checking partners so fewer people see it.”</p><p>He didn’t share, however, how much of that misinformation was about vaccines, or details on the company’s enforcement of its more general vaccine misinformation rules. That’s likely not an accident. The company has repeatedly resisted efforts that could shed light on how misinformation spreads on its platform.</p><p>Facebook executives declined a request from their data scientists who asked for additional resources to study COVID-19 misinformation at the start of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/facebook-misinformation-blind-spot.html"><ins>according to</ins></a><em>The New York Times</em>. It’s not clear why the request was turned down, but the company has also pushed back on outsiders’ efforts to gain insight into health misinformation.</p><p>Facebook has declined to share the results of an internal study on vaccine hesitancy on its platform, according to Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine’s office, which has launched a consumer protection investigation into the company’s handling of vaccine misinformation.</p><p>“Facebook has said it’s taking action to address the proliferation of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on its site,” a spokesperson said. “But then when pressed to show its work, Facebook refused.”</p><p>The Biden Administration has also — unsuccessfully — pushed Facebook to be more forthcoming about vaccine misinformation. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, administration officials have met repeatedly with Facebook and other platforms as part of its effort to curb misinformations about coronavirus vaccines. Yet when a White House official asked Facebook to share “how often misinformation was viewed and spread,” the company refused. According to <em>The Times</em>, “Facebook responded to some requests for information by talking about vaccine promotion strategies,’ such as its PSAs or its tool to help users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-will-show-you-when-and-where-you-can-get-vaccinated-085707231.html"><ins>book</ins></a> vaccine appointments.</p><p>One issue is that it’s not always easy to define what is, and isn’t, misinformation. Factual information, like news stories or personal anecdotes about vaccine side effects, can be shared with misleading commentary. This, Facebook has suggested, makes it difficult to study the issue in the way that many have asked. At the same time, Facebook is a notoriously data-driven company. It’s constantly testing even the smallest features, and it employs scores of researchers and data scientists. It’s difficult to believe that learning more about vaccine hesitancy and how misinformation spreads is entirely out of reach.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c1216d4-1c88-4ccf-97cd-a4c915a7bc34</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 17:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628874013</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T17:00:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen through two moving buses in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018.

Senior software engineering VP Craig Federighi <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600?mod=rss_Technology">told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> in an interview that introducing both the scans for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on iCloud and opt-in local monitoring of iMessage sexual content was a &quot;recipe for this kind of confusion.&quot; People conflated the two and thought that Apple might spy on messages, Federighi claimed, adding that he wished Apple had &quot;come out a little more clearly.&quot;</p><p>The executive maintained that Apple was striking the right balance between child safety and privacy, and addressed some of the concerns that surfaced since the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html">announced its new measures</a> in early August. He stressed that the scans of iCloud-destined photos would only flag existing images in a CSAM database, not any picture in your library. The system only sends an alert when you reach a threshold of 30 images, so false positives aren&#39;t likely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The system also has &quot;multiple levels of auditability,&quot; Federighi said. On-device scanning will reportedly make it easier for researchers to check if Apple ever misused the technology.  Federighi also rejected the notion that the technique might be used to scan for other material, such as politics, noting that the database of images comes from multiple child safety groups, not just the agency that will receive any red-flag reports (the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children).</p><p>The response won&#39;t satisfy those who object to the very notion that Apple is scanning photos on their phones, even with privacy protections in place. It is, however, a recognition that it can be a challenge to properly address privacy issues — it doesn&#39;t take much to prompt an uproar.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-on-confusion-over-child-safety-updates-csam-150121989.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f80fb9bf-28e4-41ff-9a9b-fcefc4836887</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 15:01:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628874025</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T17:00:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95838b10-fc3e-11eb-b7ff-a4f65f41eba6" width="3810" height="2706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95838b10-fc3e-11eb-b7ff-a4f65f41eba6" width="3810" height="2706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 03:  Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi speaks during the keynote address during the 2019 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 03, 2019 in San Jose, California.

I bought into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instantpot">Instant Pot</a> hype a few years ago and tried out an air fryer as well. (I ended up getting the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Breville Smart Oven Air" href="https://amzn.to/3CDBgFu">Breville Smart Oven Air</a>, a toaster oven with an air-frying setting.) I also own a host of other contraptions cluttering up my kitchen cabinets: a juicer, food processor, ice cream maker and <em>two</em> sous vide machines.</p><p>Yet, the appliance I use the most is the humble microwave. Like many of you, I use it mainly for reheating leftovers or warming up frozen dinners. I’ve never really considered using it for actual cooking, except for the occasional “microwave mug cake” recipe I’ve seen go viral on social media. Oh, I’ve heard of cookbooks from the ‘70s and ‘80s that tried to sell the public on the wonders of microwave cooking — I’m sure my mom even bought a few back in my youth — but those have largely turned out to be full of culinary deception. (A roast beef dinner via microwave? I don’t think so.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But a few months ago I saw an Instagram ad for a new line of cookware that was designed to be used specifically with the microwave. It’s called <a href="https://fave.co/2V5GbOh">Anyday</a>, and it was co-founded by renowned chef David Chang of Momofuku and Ugly Delicious fame. The ad showed luscious photos of mashed potatoes, mapo tofu, mac and cheese, and a chicken and pea dish that all looked really delicious. Could all of this really be made with just the microwave? Perhaps the best kitchen appliance was under my nose all along? Needless to say, I was intrigued.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aaf93390-fa78-11eb-bbf3-20a272778099" alt="Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="ac9003db-cb85-3ebe-b4a1-aa20dcad3e3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>According to Anyday, the main thing differentiating its cookware from regular microwave-safe containers is its glass lid. It has a silicone gasket that blocks splatters and keeps moisture in, as well as a knob at the top that can be pulled out for steam to escape through air vents. The knob can also be pushed down to create an airtight leakproof seal, at which point the containers are also stackable. In contrast, my existing set of Pyrex containers just have regular plastic lids, which even the manufacturer recommends shouldn’t be used in the microwave since they can warp.</p><p>I should note here that the Anyday lids do have stainless steel rims, which you might think is a little dangerous to put in the microwave. But they’re actually safe on account of their smooth, curved shape, which prevents arcing. The company does warn against heating up two dishes at once, however, as the combination of two stainless steel lids might result in sparks flying.</p><p>Also, the Anyday dishes themselves are made of a frosted borosilicate glass which can withstand large temperature fluctuations without cracking. This last part is important, as certain ceramics and glass aren’t completely microwave safe. For example, I tried heating up a potato once on a plate I bought from IKEA, and it ended up splitting in two. The plate, that is, not the potato.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2d695770-fa78-11eb-b7db-3af8518eb459" alt="Mac and Cheese in Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="77ec823a-39df-346b-b811-cc567c276251"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, I was a little skeptical. So I went ahead and purchased a <a href="https://fave.co/2V5GbOh">full set of Anyday cookware</a> just to try everything out. That’s four dishes total — shallow and deep in medium and large sizes — which is admittedly quite expensive at $120. Alternatively, you can get the <a href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">medium set</a> of two dishes for $55 or the <a href="https://fave.co/3BUrrCA">large set</a> for $75. You can also opt to buy each dish separately; the two medium ones go for $30 a piece while the large options are $40 a piece. That definitely makes this pretty pricey compared to an average set of microwave-safe containers — a full 18-piece Snapware Pyrex set, for example, is just $30.</p><p>The Anyday set comes with several recipe cards, which are very handy to start out with, but the best place to find recipes is on the Anyday website. You’ll find everything from one-ingredient recipes (e.g., you just want to steam some rice) to full recipes such as black bean soup and squash curry. On each recipe page, you can select your desired serving size as well as the wattage of your specific microwave oven, which will determine variables such as dish size, cook time and what power level you should use.</p><p>I’ve used the Anyday cookware for several weeks now, and I’ve actually been mostly impressed with the results. The first recipe I tried was a chicken and rice meal with peas and marinara sauce. I was nervous about whether it would work, but it turned out to be delicious, with the chicken cooked through to the bone and the rice tender and fluffy. The Thai pineapple chicken recipe also worked out well. I think I would’ve preferred it if the onions were browned and caramelized like they would be on the stove, but for microwave cooking, it was completely satisfactory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e3b7f20-fa78-11eb-bebf-14b201f59ba7" alt="Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="3ac00efc-e4df-3e03-a6c7-96a224fddf29"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>One dish in particular was a revelation for me: Silky Chinese steamed egg. This is a recipe that can be quite tricky to master on the stove, as you need to steam it slowly over a gentle heat. But in the microwave, it’s a matter of heating the custard solution at a lower power level for just four to five minutes, depending on your microwave wattage. (The company&#39;s site recommends Power Level 4.)  I’ve never really fiddled around with my microwave’s power settings before, but now that I see it can result in a smooth custard, I will definitely be using it more often.</p><p>Another killer application, at least for me, is poached eggs. I usually find poaching eggs to be a bit of a chore; you have to heat up a pot of water, carefully drop in the egg and hope you’re able to rescue it when it’s done just right. It’s especially challenging when it’s six in the morning and I haven’t had my coffee just yet. But with the Anyday and the microwave, all I have to do is fill up a shallow dish with cold water straight from the tap, crack an egg into it, cover it, nuke it for two minutes and it’s done. The yolk is cooked just enough so that it’s a little runny, which is how I like it. I almost couldn’t believe it.</p><p>The experience wasn’t perfect, however. For example, I tried using the Anyday to cook white rice, and even though I followed the recipe exactly, the water in the dish boiled over, pushing the lid up and spilling out into the microwave. As a result, the rice wasn’t cooked correctly, and I had to add the water back in and cook it further. I tried cooking the rice in a much larger dish later on and it worked out better, but I wish the site had suggested that instead of me finding out on my own.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5044ae70-fa78-11eb-aff7-f6e6313688ef" alt="Silky Chinese Steamed Egg Custard via Anyday" data-uuid="b95e112e-d04f-3ac3-8c47-41e6ea3debd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of the recipes, I should note that not all microwave ovens are the same, even among those with the same wattage. My microwave, for example, is apparently more powerful than normal, and it took way less time for me to steam broccoli than the site recommended. I also found that not all microwave ovens&#39; power levels are the same either. My Power Level 4 could be your Power Level 3. I definitely had to play around with different variables in order to get certain foods to cook properly.</p><p>Plus, there are certain kinds of cooking that the microwave just cannot do. You’re just not going to get the same kind of browning that you can get on the stove or in the oven. You can’t use it to deep fry or roast or bake. What you’re basically doing is steaming food, albeit in a more controlled way. The microwave won’t replace your stove or your oven or your Instant Pot completely.</p><p>But, for all its flaws, I still think the Anyday cookware is great. It’s made me realize that the microwave has a lot more uses than just reheating leftovers. It’s opened up a whole new world of culinary possibilities that I had not realized existed before. Sure, the mac and cheese I made in the microwave won’t be as amazing as the one baked in the oven, but the former can be done in under 10 minutes, and it still tastes creamy and cheesy. I’ve also made instant ramen in the Anyday and the microwave to great success.</p><p>It might not make the best food you’ve ever tasted, but for college students and time-pressed parents and professionals, the microwave might just be the most versatile appliance in the kitchen. As long as you have the right cookware for it anyway.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anyday-cookware-irl-hands-on-140042882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2390786-aac2-41c9-8fc0-0cd5d3afbbae</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628868496</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T15:28:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ad73e70-fa78-11eb-bf7d-e0a0f9a7be41" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ad73e70-fa78-11eb-bf7d-e0a0f9a7be41" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anyday Cookware]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anyday Cookware]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senators ask Amazon how it will use palm print data from its stores (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re concerned that Amazon might misuse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-palm-recognition-go-stores-seattle-100718649.html">palm print data from its One service</a>, you&#39;re not alone. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/amazon-biometric-data-senate-letter">reports</a> that Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bill Cassidy and Jon Ossoff have sent a letter to new Amazon chief <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-final-date-174948346.html">Andy Jassy</a> asking him to explain how the company might expand use of One&#39;s palm print system beyond stores like Amazon Go and Whole Foods. They&#39;re also worried the biometric payment data might be used for more than payments, such as for ads and tracking.</p><p>The politicians are concerned that Amazon One reportedly uploads palm print data to the cloud, creating &quot;unique&quot; security issues. The move also casts doubt on Amazon&#39;s &quot;respect&quot; for user privacy, the senators said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to asking about expansion plans, the senators wanted Jassy to outline the number of third-party One clients, the privacy protections for those clients and their customers and the size of the One user base. The trio gave Amazon until August 26th to provide an answer. We&#39;ve asked Amazon for comment.</p><p>This won&#39;t necessarily lead to government restrictions on One and other biometric payment tech. Amazon might not get much sympathy, however. The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-offering-10-in-credit-for-your-palm-print-data-114014151.html">offered $10 in credit</a> to potential One users, raising questions about its eagerness to collect palm print data. This also isn&#39;t the first time Amazon has clashed with government — cities have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-orlando-amazon-rekognition-pilot.html">dropped Amazon&#39;s Rekognition</a> face detection system, and Congress has<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-congress-committee-facial-recognition-tech-regulation.html"> proposed face detection regulations</a> with Rekognition in mind. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if the One investigation eventually led to legislative action, even if the effort isn&#39;t targeted specifically at Amazon.</p><p><strong>Update 8/13 at 11:05AM:</strong> Amazon declined to comment, but pointed to an earlier <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle">blog post</a> where it said One palm images were never stored on-device and were sent encrypted to a &quot;highly secure&quot; cloud space devoted just to One content.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senators-amazon-palm-print-data-investigation-134424558.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">451c840e-9934-4575-9a7e-f8207daf977d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:44:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628867168</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T15:06:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e62ca7f0-fc33-11eb-b3bb-37c2f81426cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e62ca7f0-fc33-11eb-b3bb-37c2f81426cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon One palm print reader]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon One palm print reader]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best Buy discounts Surface laptops, Galaxy tablets in its latest weekend sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Best Buy is back with a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:new three-day sale" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWnL5n">new three-day sale</a> that reduces the prices of many gadgets, including laptops and tablets from Microsoft and Samsung.

crypto hack</a>, the perpetrator who returned most of the $611 million in stolen digital tokens is being offered a $500,000 reward. The prize is a bug bounty to be precise, an incentive offered by tech organizations to those who report security vulnerabilities. In a statement, Poly Network referred to the culprit as a &quot;white hat&quot; in reference to his status as an ethical hacker. The decentralized finance platform thanked the hacker for &quot;helping to improve&quot; its security, but did not mention how it would pay the reward or whether it had been accepted.&nbsp;</p><div id="77756129a32f4e3ca4e3d98c7f0a9384"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">$342 million (As of 12 Aug 08:18:29 AM +UTC) of assets had been returned: <br>Ethereum: $4.6M <br>BSC: $252M <br>Polygon: $85M <br><br>The remaining is $268M on Ethereum</p>— Poly Network (@PolyNetwork2) <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425733950614360064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>A person claiming to be the perpetrator confirmed that Poly Network had offered him a $500,000 bounty to return the stolen assets and promised that he would not be held accountable for the incident, according to messages shared on Twitter by Tom Robinson, the chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic, a crypto tracking firm.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d2c3a0f189594a55939f1c9d4e7c0deb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s not over yet!

The company revealed on Tuesday that it was the victim of a massive crypto heist that saw a hacker make away with about $611 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other digital currencies.&nbsp;</p><p>On Wednesday, the hacker began returning the stolen funds after claiming they were ready to surrender. Poly Network said on Friday that the hacker had repaid $340 million worth of assets into a digital wallet. All that remains is the $33 million in tether frozen by the company behind the cryptocurrency.</p><p>It&#39;s still unclear what prompted the hacker to backtrack. Some experts believe that they may have found it hard to launder and cash out the large amount of stolen crypto. While others suggest that the hacker was afraid of being exposed and prosecuted after researchers discovered a trove of identifying info, including an email and IP address.

Like Hanks&#39; war movie <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-greyhound-tom-hanks-ww-ii-drama-july-10-092506494.html"><em>Greyhound </em></a>before it, the film became a casualty of the pandemic, mired by release date delays until Apple swooped in to acquire it from Universal. The robot (pictured above) is played by Caleb Landry Jones, fresh off a best actor win at Cannes.&nbsp;</p><p>Hanks plays the titular character, an ailing robotics engineer who emerges from his self-imposed underground exile to journey across a desolate American wasteland. Along for the ride are his dog, Goodyear, and an android who names himself Jeff. Together, they make a dysfunctional family, but can they learn to get along? I guess we&#39;ll have to wait till November to find out.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Finch </em>is also loaded with offscreen talent. The good-natured sci-fi flick is directed by Emmy-winning <em>Game of Thrones</em> lead Miguel Sapochnik, with <em>Alien</em> scribe Ivor Powell and newcomer Craig Luck on screenwriting duties. While director Robert Zemeckis<em>&nbsp;</em>serves as an exec-producer and the film hails from Steven Spielberg&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steven-spielberg-netflix-ambiln-175031862.html">Amblin Entertainment</a>, which may explain why the plot gives off major <em>Cast Away</em> and <em>AI </em>vibes.</p><p>The November release date also signals Apple&#39;s possible confidence in the film&#39;s awards chances. Either that or it&#39;s just looking to add a major movie to its fall line-up, which is already stocked with big hitters like sci-fi series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-isaac-asimov-release-date-152711615.html"><em>Foundation</em></a><em>, </em>the second season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-show-season-2-teaser-apple-tv-plus-141241307.html"><em>The Morning Show</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and current affairs show <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-221022043.html"><em>The Problem with Jon Stewart</em></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tom-hanks-finch-release-date-085915154.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">62b4d578-0a0e-4469-af81-d05e0be4787c</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 08:59:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628857176</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T12:19:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/14839d00-fc13-11eb-b771-ff01baf6651d" width="2500" height="1665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/14839d00-fc13-11eb-b771-ff01baf6651d" width="2500" height="1665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Finch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Finch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney says it found ways to compensate talent in the wake of 'Black Widow' lawsuit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disney has apparently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/12/disney-ceo-on-talent-compensation-after-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit.html">found</a> &quot;ways to fairly compensate&quot; talent, even if it continues its hybrid release strategy. Company CEO Bob Chapek said during an earnings call that Disney has &quot;entered hundreds of talent arrangements with [its] talent and by and large, they&#39;ve gone very very smoothly.&quot; Chapek&#39;s statement comes in the wake of the lawsuit <em>Black Widow</em> star Scarlett Johansson <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">filed</a> against the company over its streaming strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Johansson&#39;s salary was tied to the movie&#39;s box office success, and her original contract didn&#39;t cover earnings from a hybrid release. According to her complaint, she could lose over $50 million due to the company&#39;s decision to simultaneously launch <em>Black Widow</em> in theaters and on Disney+, where it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html">made $60 million</a> during its opening weekend. Back then, Disney released a statement calling the lawsuit &quot;especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, Chapek said Disney is &quot;trying to do the best thing for all [its] constituents and make sure that everybody who&#39;s in the value chain [...] feels like they&#39;re having their contractual commitments honored both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint.&quot; He didn&#39;t talk about specifics, however, or Johansson&#39;s lawsuit in particular. In Johansson&#39;s complaint, she said her camp tried to renegotiate her deal with the company upon learning about the simultaneous release. However, Disney and Marvel were allegedly unresponsive.</p><p>Chapek also <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/marvels-shang-chi-set-to-hit-disney-plus-in-mid-october-possibly-free/#ftag=CAD590a51e">talked</a> about implementing an experimental release strategy for <em>Shang-Chi</em>. Unlike <em>Black Widow</em>, it will be a theater-exclusive for 45 days before making its way to Disney+. Further, subscribers may be able to watch it for free instead of having to pay extra for it like they&#39;ve had to do with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-date-232629863.html"><em>Mulan</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01ee3bb7-a0f8-4801-a037-ecc23c2081b5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:05:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628862197</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T13:43:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2263280-fbf3-11eb-bed3-bf1de5baeb27" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2263280-fbf3-11eb-bed3-bf1de5baeb27" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Black Widow]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black Widow]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google makes Meet moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can be hard for a single host to manage large unruly video meetings, particularly given the complexity and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-filters-masks-ios-android-084044336.html">features</a> available in video conferencing apps these days. Now, Google has a solution for its Meet app with a new feature that allows you to have up to 25 co-hosts in a meeting, as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/12/google-meet-co-hosts/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> has reported. That way, they can split chore like muting participants, launching polls, managing Q&amp;As and more, while you focus on the business at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the feature was only available to Google Workspace for Education customers. Now, it&#39;s on all of Google&#39;s Meet apps across desktop and mobile, including users with personal Google accounts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, Google introduced new controls for meeting hosts, which can be extended to co-hosts. All hosts will be able to limit who can share their screen, limit who can send chat messages, mute all with one click, end the meeting for all and control who can join the meeting and how they can join with the &quot;quick access&quot; setting. The latter allows participants in the same domain to enter automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quick access” allows automatic video call entry for users in the same domain. If disabled, hosts must join first, and those that are not invited will have to request permission to enter. Otherwise, the host must join first and give permission to anyone who isn&#39;t invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The last feature, the &quot;People&quot; panel, adds search to let hosts quickly find participants if moderation actions are needed. The new features will begin rolling out next week on the web and Meet for Android, and the iOS version will arrive at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-makes-moderation-easier-by-allowing-up-to-25-people-to-co-host-055344666.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">901ee10b-64c0-448a-b59a-f3d6ad475a58</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 05:53:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628834024</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T05:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
