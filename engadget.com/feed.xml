It also received a Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certificate in Europe, allowing patients and medical staff to use the device more widely. Finally, it&#39;s taken a step closer to personal exoskeletons with additional funding.</p><p>The last time I saw Wandercraft&#39;s first-generation exoskeleton was over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-wandercraft-exoskeleton-paraplegic-help-walk.html">four years ago</a>, which is ages in the field of robotics. However, I recently got a chance to see the latest model in use with paraplegic patients, and chat with them and the team behind Atalante.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f39e80-7973-11ec-b3f9-55ea665fbcd3" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="de656013-2588-3a69-991a-6ac01bc3ca1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-04-mind-controlled-robotic-exoskeleton-paralysis.html">Exoskeletons</a> (or exos, as they&#39;re called in the industry) are powered &quot;wearable robots&quot; adapted to each user, designed to aid in walking rehabilitation treatments and restore a patient&#39;s mobility. Atalante is Wandercraft&#39;s second-generation exo with a more advanced design and features than the original model. It comes with a remote to operate it and a new app that lets a physiotherapist and patient fine tune movements and exercise programs. It uses two sets of removable batteries that allow for continuous use.</p><p>The latest model is much smaller, more streamlined and more comfortable for patients, thanks to new hardware, tweaks in the fit and more intelligent software. It&#39;s now self balancing, so it&#39;s easier to control for both patients and physiotherapists. Although it&#39;s not yet approved to be used alone, Wandercraft showed me a video demonstrating that it can self balance, even when shoved off kilter. It also offers features that make it easier to get in and out, along with the &quot;Wander Balance&quot; feature that allows for easy &quot;verticalization&quot; to help the patient stand up.</p><iframe src="https://www.yahoo.com/wandercraft-gait-video-073827881.html?format=embed&amp;region=US&amp;lang=en-US&amp;site=engadget&amp;player_autoplay=false" width="640" height="360" data-yom-embed-source="{media_id_1:70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68}" data-yahoo-uuid="70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" id="4b27c583c1f247879c8dcd543efd6ec2"></iframe><p>&nbsp;The device automatically generates optimized and adjustable kinematics according to a each patient&#39;s morphology, with the settings allowing for custom exercises. The latest feature is &quot;RealGait&quot; (shown above) which allows for physiological walking with adjustable speeds. &quot;CustomGait&quot; allows the pace, step length and mass center to be changed, while &quot;ActiveGait&quot; lets the user change the assistance effort from 0 to 100 percent. That feature also includes an &quot;EarlyGait&quot; setting for first steps, along with the new RealGait setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Those features, plus smaller changes make Atalante far more useful. &quot;We&#39;ve  improved half turns so they happen on a spot rather than taking up a lot of space,&quot; Wandercraft CEO Matthieu Masselin told me. &quot;We&#39;ve redesigned things like the attachments and padding. That allows the patient to get in an out more quickly, move more comfortably and get more walking done in each session — which means more rehabilitation and re-education benefits.&quot;</p><p>All of that is enabled by numerous sensors and software that can make adjustments on the fly, Wandercraft told me. The device&#39;s &quot;sense of balance&quot; makes the various gait patterns possible, while also giving the patient and physiotherapist confidence that the device (which is still not light at 130 pounds) won&#39;t tip over.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2c68130-7974-11ec-a7bb-3295c210c454" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="1e0006aa-b782-3954-b642-3ca5bfa4956a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Wandercraft allows some patients to use Atalante for rehabilitation purposes and I saw it in action with Arbiha, a paraplegic patient who has used it for multiple sessions. The device was suspended from the ceiling and operated by a physiotherapist for safety reasons, but the plan is to one day have a version that can be used in the real world without assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>It was striking how easily she was able to walk during a relatively long one hour session. The exo therapy offers some clear benefits like stimulation of the cardiovascular/lymphatic systems and training for the arms and other supporting muscles, but it goes well beyond that.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adfa7690-7975-11ec-b1be-062b929303aa" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="6bd890d5-7c1c-36f9-b331-30db02925292"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;It boosts both my body and my spirits,&quot; Arbhia told me. &quot;It gives me a cardiovascular workout that I couldn&#39;t get otherwise. Being upright for a fairly long period of time helps my balance, too, as you lose that aspect when you don&#39;t stand up. I have a digestive malady and the walking therapy has also helped stabilize that, which is something I didn&#39;t expect at all.&quot;</p><p>Wandercraft&#39;s eventual goal is a personal exoskeleton that can be used as an assistance device at home or in the streets. To that end, the company just received $45 million in financing to help it fulfill that &quot;mobility for all&quot; mission. &quot;With the team we have, the financing we&#39;ve received and the deeptech technology developed, we&#39;re confident that we can one day have our exos on the streets and in people&#39;s homes,&quot; said Masselin. &quot;But we still have a lot of work to do.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wandercrafts-latest-exoskeleton-has-a-more-natural-gait-060009831.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e60c2714-e2a4-4610-8357-0e4e5d2d1de6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 06:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642665240</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T07:54:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57e437e0-7958-11ec-95b3-9755dee16e98" width="2100" height="1414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57e437e0-7958-11ec-95b3-9755dee16e98" width="2100" height="1414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wandercraft's latest exoskeleton helps paraplegics walk with a more natural gait]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wandercraft's latest exoskeleton helps paraplegics walk with a more natural gait]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="" medium="video"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wandercraft Gait Video]]></media:title><media:embed><![CDATA[]]></media:embed></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Consumer Reports now rewards driver monitoring, but only Ford and GM pass muster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With more automakers including driver assistance systems in their cars, <em>Consumer Reports </em>is changing how it grades those vehicles. Starting this year, the outlet will add an additional two points to a car’s overall score if its included driver assistance system encourages safe driving. Moving forward, it will also deduct points from a vehicle’s total score if it finds the opposite is true, starting with two points in 2024 and then four points in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>“We believe it&#39;s time to recognize vehicles that have found a safer way to deploy this technology,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of the publication’s Auto Test Center. By its own estimation, <em>Consumer Reports</em> says an adequate driver monitoring system is one that will “reliably” detect when the driver has become inattentive and alert them to that fact. It adds the system should escalate those warnings and eventually stop the car if it finds they’re not responding.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Consumer Reports</em> said it would also take into account an automaker’s privacy policy when evaluating a driver monitoring system, and may not award additional points in some instances. The outlet reasons strong privacy protections are essential to convince drivers to use the feature.</p><p>The outlet<em>&nbsp;</em>will put the new ranking guidelines into action when reveals<em>&nbsp;</em>its<em>&nbsp;</em>2022 Autos Top Picks<em>&nbsp;</em>on February 17th, but it gave an early preview of what to expect on Thursday, noting only cars from Ford and GM earned additional points for their driver assistance features. The outlet said BMW, Ford, GM, Tesla and Subaru all claim their systems can detect and prevent driver inattention, but notes it found some “serious flaws” in those systems through its testing.</p><p>Beyond mentioning the automaker, <em>Consumer Reports</em> didn’t call out Tesla specifically, but the two have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-recommendation.html"><ins>adversarial history</ins></a>. In 2020, <em>Consumer Reports </em>ranked Autopilot a “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-second-to-gm-super-cruise-consumer-reports-151025030.html"><ins>distant second</ins></a>” to GM’s Super Cruise. At the time, it said GM’s system was better at notifying drivers when it was about to disengage, and the automaker’s use of an infrared camera to monitor the driver led to a safer system overall.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/consumer-reports-driver-monitoring-050056768.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4a245cb-6c1e-49ad-b991-4f81679f89d3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 05:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642632850</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T22:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/c23c1040-1aae-11eb-9acb-4b8d39a25eae" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/c23c1040-1aae-11eb-9acb-4b8d39a25eae" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 in the desert]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 in the desert]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Play Games are available on Windows in a three-country beta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-games-are-coming-to-windows-pcs-in-2022-030736542.html">Google Play Games on Windows</a> — if you live in the right country.

CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) has <a href="https://www.concacaf.com/news/concacaf-to-use-var-in-multiple-competitions-in-2022/">revealed</a> it will use VAR to help refs in numerous 2022 competitions.

Enthusiasts are concerned the requests for video reviews can slow down matches, and that the use of centralized review hubs could be used to skew decisions. Soccer already has plenty of drama over tackles and handballs, they argue — VAR just draws out those disputes and takes away from the thrill of the game.</p><p>However, the arguments against the system appear to have lost some momentum. VAR helped reverse 17 out of 20 bad calls during the 2018 World Cup, and some backers have contended that video reviews would have overturned other mistakes if they had been used more consistently.

There&#39;s a map builder for constructing and sharing stages with friends, a 100 level battle pass, as well as new One Flag CTF and Evolution modes. (The latter gives the losing team of every round increasingly powerful weapons.) Developer 1047 Games also says the Foregone Destruction map is getting a major fidelity bump, which should be a sign of similar upgrades coming to other maps.</p><p>“Our custom map creator will continue to evolve alongside the rest of the game,” Ian Proulx, CEO of 1047 Games, said in a statement. “We’re looking at the map creator as an evolutionary tool driven by the community — it’s a robust feature for fans to play with day one of our new season, and we’re really interested in hearing feedback from the community regarding the types of features and tools they want.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of this sounds like great news for <em>Splitgate</em> fans—at least, the few who&#39;ve stuck around.

The dual-motor trailer not only reduces the burden on the towing vehicle, but can be remote-controlled from your phone to help you hitch up, reverse or simply move your camp site. You can even use the motors to shift the weight distribution, so you might not need a special hitch to handle certain trailer loads.</p><p>The other concept, the Thor Vision Vehicle, is a Ford Transit-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electric-brands-ebussy-194041042.html">electric RV</a>. The design is conventional, but Thor teased a &quot;best in class&quot; 300-mile range along with a digital cockpit that includes extensive tools to find chargers along your route.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no mention of whether or not the eStream or TVV will lead to ready-to-buy models, let alone timeframes for production. However, it&#39;s easy to see both reaching customers. Campers and other trailers significantly limit the range of any towing vehicle, and often demand extra power. While an electric camper like the eStream would have its own challenges (the weight and wear of its batteries, for instance), it could limit the overall impact on range and make towing an option for vehicles that would normally struggle.</p><div id="93ff81f3e58b4a2786384fe24442c459"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSzwMGXKthQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airstream-electric-camper-estream-concept-211006027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">453388ec-3df8-4240-a973-ae1f9e7e4184</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 21:10:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642626607</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T21:10:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0d390af0-7966-11ec-b86f-d65a9c2788a2" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0d390af0-7966-11ec-b86f-d65a9c2788a2" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airstream eStream electric concept camper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airstream eStream electric concept camper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nanoleaf has stopped selling its original wall tiles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nanoleaf is retiring the product that made it into a household name.

But many challenges, from designing cars that can easily hold the fuel, to setting up reliable hydrogen distribution, have made it difficult to turn that dream into a reality. But what if you used those fuel cells to set up a remote EV charging station, or to replace a traditional gas or diesel generator for a large camp? That&#39;s what GM is planning to do with its HYDROTEC fuel cell technology, the <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0119-hydrotec.html">company announced today</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de0-7965-11ec-8391-9e184bc110b3" style="height:1316;width:2000;" alt="GM fuel cell mobile power generator" data-uuid="d8ffca3e-d770-31a7-9ee2-86c167f2dc00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GM</div></figure><p>GM&#39;s Mobile Power Generators, or MPGs, are pretty self descriptive: they&#39;d basically let you bring large amounts of electricity anywhere without burning fossil fuels, or expanding a local power grid. It could be useful for concerts, movie sets, or neighborhoods that frequently lose power. (In my town outside of Atlanta, almost everyone owns a gas generator to deal with storm-related outages.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement also makes plenty of sense for GM, as it&#39;s already bringing its fuel cell technology to <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/0127-navistar.html">trucking</a>, <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0617-hydrotec.html">aerospace</a> and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0615-wabtec.html">rail partners</a>. The company says the MPGs will be able to spit out 60 to 600 kilowatts without producing much noise or heat.</p><p>GM plans to show off an MPG-powered EV charging station in the middle of 2022, a project co-funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the U.S. Army. Additionally, the California Energy Commission is exploring how MPGs could help provide energy during power shutdowns. GM is also working together with Renewable Innovations to build the EMPOWER rapid charger, which could deliver fast EV charging to existing stations without the need for huge infrastructure improvements. Taking things to an even more extreme level, there&#39;s a large MPG implementation that could potentially power large military camps and heavy-duty equipment. (And as a bonus, those camps can actually use the water the MPG emits.)</p><p>While it&#39;ll likely be years before MPGs can actually deployed, it&#39;s heartening to see GM explore uses for fuel cells outside of cars. Battery-powered EVs have evolved so quickly that hydrogen-powered cars don&#39;t have much of a future (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-second-generation-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-060056654.html">sorry, Toyota</a>).

The leader has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-national-security-memorandum-to-improve-the-cybersecurity-of-national-security-department-of-defense-and-intelligence-community-systems/">signed</a> a memorandum aiming to improve digital security for the Defense Department, the intelligence community and national security systems. The notice sets firmer requirements, both for schedules and for the technology needed to lock down government data.</p><p>The memo lets the NSA require agencies to take &quot;specific actions&quot; in response to threats and security flaws, and asks the NSA to coordinate with Homeland Security on directives. Agencies will also have to identify their national security systems, report incidents and secure tools that transfer data between classified and unclassified systems. The President&#39;s move also sets timelines and guidance for implementing technologies required in the executive order, ranging from encryption to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Biden&#39;s move complements an order that was initially signed in response to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-captures-hacker-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-012541371.html">critical infrastructure cyberattacks</a>. In theory, this will tighten security at some of the most sensitive federal government institutions. As with the order, though, the memo can only accomplish so much without Congress&#39; support. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, for instance, used the signing to <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=31242E15-8C6F-4C37-AEAB-16F580B48C20">ask Congress</a> to pass legislation requiring notices of critical infrastructure breaches within 72 hours.</p><p>The timing is apt, at least. The President&#39;s effort comes as tensions rise between Russia, the US and American allies, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html">Ukraine blaming Russia</a> for a string of cyberattacks that knocked out government websites. The situation might not lead to outright cyberwarfare, but the US still has a strong incentive to close as many security holes as possible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-memorandum-cybersecurity-defense-intelligence-195058392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecedc632-9ed4-4ef5-8ea0-a5ca71886611</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:50:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642624209</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild the US and the progress made since he signed the bill into law, in the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2022.

What started as Google Apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-29-google-for-work-has-a-new-name-g-suite.html"><ins>became G Suite</ins></a> and is now known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-rebrand-gmail-logo-105013517.html"><ins>Workspace</ins></a>. Over that same timeframe, the company has offered just as many ways to access that software, announcing new subscription plans while doing away with older ones. It now plans to sunset a tier that had survived the suite’s most recent rebranding.</p><p>In an email spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the company told Workspace administrators it won’t offer G Suite legacy free edition as of <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217#faq&amp;zippy=%2Chow-does-the-upgrade-affect-my-current-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-subscription"><ins>July 1st, 2022</ins></a>. The company plans to transition those users to paid accounts starting on May 1st. Google says it will automatically select a subscription plan for users who don’t pick one on their own by the start of May, noting it will look at their current usage when making the decision. Any individual or organization the company migrates to a paid subscription plan automatically won’t be billed for at least two months. However, the company says it will suspend the accounts of individuals and organizations that don’t input their billing information by July 1st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Business and enterprise Workspace accounts start at a monthly cost of $6 per user. The company will offer &quot;deep&quot; discounts to those affected by the decision. To be clear, if you&#39;re using Gmail, Docs, Sheets and other apps through a <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">free Google account</a>, you won&#39;t be affected by the move. What&#39;s more, Google will continue to offer free Workspace plans to <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/workspace/compare/"><ins>nonprofits</ins></a> and schools that qualify for its <a href="https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_ca/products/workspace-for-education/"><ins>Fundamentals tier</ins></a>. That’s not changing with today’s announcement, nor do organizations with legacy G Suite Basic, Business, Education or Nonprofit subscriptions have to worry about a potential surprise bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-gsuite-legacy-free-edition-july-31st-185543682.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3106c271-2eb2-4582-8b95-c9b8905e526c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:55:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642619914</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T19:18:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/4a991890-cb33-11eb-87b7-640bb93ca56a" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/4a991890-cb33-11eb-87b7-640bb93ca56a" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An image showing Spaces in Google Chat.

So, most metro areas should have at least some C-Band 5G coverage from Verizon in the coming weeks.</p><p>The C-Band spectrum has more bandwidth than the low-band spectrum AT&amp;T and Verizon used in their previous 5G rollouts. That should enable faster download and upload speeds than earlier iterations of 5G. Verizon claims its C-Band 5G is up to 10 times faster than 4G LTE, with download speeds that have exceeded 1 Gbps in some areas.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon initially planned to switch on C-Band 5G in December, but they pushed back the activation following concerns from the FAA and airlines.

It will help it address one of the more notable gaps in its live TV offering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-weather-channel-youtube-tv-announcement-173531182.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a4d83d5-057d-4a03-a17b-8582236714ee</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:35:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642612718</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:18:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/23fb02d0-baf8-11ea-b77f-d75054f6c921" width="4000" height="2670" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/23fb02d0-baf8-11ea-b77f-d75054f6c921" width="4000" height="2670" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2019/11/22: In this photo illustration a Youtube TV logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

The video is, unsurprisingly, packed with gorgeous visuals while offering some details on what seems to be a solid expansion of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>&#39;s rich story.</p><div id="da8fe0a1d6264859b423b68a90c0b568"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UxDWGW7Z67I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;People are suffering. Soon, they&#39;ll starve,&quot; protagonist Aloy (Ashly Burch) says at the beginning of the trailer. &quot;The machines, meant to help us, are out of control. I have to find a way to fix it all. The answer is somewhere out in the Forbidden West.&quot; We soon learn that, in that part of the world, war is the order of the day, so Aloy clearly has another difficult journey ahead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with some familiar faces like Varl and Erend, there are some new characters in the trailer — both friendly and hostile ones. Angela Bassett plays one of the antagonists, Regalla. She&#39;s a rebel leader who &quot;seeks to slaughter all those who&#39;ve wronged her&quot; and has the ability to control the machines, granted to her by a returning character. The three-minute clip closes with a glimpse of a mysterious character named Tilda. Guerrilla Games told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/19/breaking-down-the-new-horizon-forbidden-west-trailer-with-guerrilla-games"><em>Game Informer</em></a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-review-160043378.html"><em>The Matrix</em></a> star Carrie-Anne Moss plays her.</p><p>Of course, some of the machines Aloy will battle appear in the clip too. Among them is a terrifying, giant cobra-rattlesnake hybrid called the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/27/horizon-forbidden-west-introducing-the-mighty-slitherfang">Slitherfang</a>, which can spit streams of acid in her direction.</p><p>Overall, the trailer offers another tantalizing look at a hotly anticipated game. Given that an unfinished build <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-leak-185242744.html">reportedly leaked</a> earlier this month, it&#39;s best for fans to tread carefully to avoid spoilers before <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>arrives on February 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-story-trailer-carrie-anne-moss-ps4-ps5-172519361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7bdf299-75c3-43a8-8205-cbf2348035e0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:25:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642612355</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:12:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerrilla Games/PlayStation Studios ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Carrie-Anne Moss as Tilda in Horizon Forbidden West.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cheeky hack-and-slash RPG ‘Nobody Saves the World’ is available now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being pushed back from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nobody-saves-the-world-annoucement-185546511.html"><ins>original 2021 release date</ins></a>, Drinkbox Studios’ playful shape-shifting RPG is available at last on Xbox and PC.</p><p>From the makers of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-guacamelee-review.html"><em><ins>Guacamelee</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-05-severed-gets-a-lavish-ps-vita-physical-release.html"><em><ins>Severed</ins></em></a>, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em> is crammed with Drinkbox’s signature self-aware humor and vivid art style while paying homage to classic RPGs from the 90s. Inspired by Final Fantasy Tactic’s Job system, the game’s titular hero Nobody can shapeshift into 18 different off-kilter forms including an egg, slug, and even a bodybuilder to complete quests and clear out dungeons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="26ea15772bc7440ebee7b930ceeddd93"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_E1RhtzDHM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The game’s overworld and top-down aesthetic will be immediately familiar to fans of other classics like <em>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. </em>Drinkbox also tacks new-school twists on the genre with clever level design and quirky combat that includes moves like the magician’s confetti bomb.

The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/academy-award-winners-jared-leto-and-anne-hathaway-star-in-new-apple-original-limited-series-wecrashed-premiering-globally-march-18-2022/">announced</a> that its Apple TV+ limited series <em>WeCrashed</em> will premiere March 18th. The eight-episode drama stars Jared Leto as former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, who wielded hype to earn a $47 billion valuation only to lose most of it (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-wework-ceo-john-legere-t-mobile-report.html">and his job</a>) when the IPO process revealed ugly financials and leadership. Anne Hathaway plays Adam&#39;s wife Rebekah, who served as an executive (including the head of WeGrow) and whose relationship with Adam was &quot;at the center of it all,&quot; according to Apple.</p><p>The trailer sets expectations quickly. The Neumanns portrayed by Leto and Hathaway are full of overly grand visions, portraying WeWork as nothing less than the future, a &quot;movement&quot; aiming to &quot;elevate the world&#39;s consciousness.&quot; The clip also highlights the cult-like devotion to the company and its notoriously summer camp-like retreats. It&#39;s not certain how well the performances will hold up across a whole series, but Apple at least seems to understand how WeWork&#39;s reality was never going to match the buzz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first streaming take on WeWork&#39;s rise and sudden decline. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-wework-documentary-adam-neumann-170036642.html">Hulu&#39;s 2021 documentary</a> was an imperfect but prominent take on the Neumann couple. Apple&#39;s effort clearly has star power, however, and the behind-the-camera talent has experience with well-received titles like <em>Little America</em> and <em>This is Us</em>. If nothing else, it&#39;s clear Apple hasn&#39;t given up its TV+ strategy of counting on big names to draw in viewers, even if the projects are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60050996">slightly unusual</a>.</p><div id="a7f3ecc40d254d44854212805b2df565"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAuhT5241h8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wework-series-wecrashed-release-date-164250999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4099c376-fab7-4207-82af-d7534c003a83</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:42:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642617709</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T18:41:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/77a7d0f0-793f-11ec-8d3e-1e3501006e4a" width="1920" height="1075" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/77a7d0f0-793f-11ec-8d3e-1e3501006e4a" width="1920" height="1075" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway in Apple TV+ series 'We Crashed']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway in Apple TV+ series 'We Crashed']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon gives its ‘Lord of the Rings’ series a redundant name]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s The Lord of the Rings series is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html">scheduled to debut on Prime Video in September</a>, which might just be far enough away to get used to the unwieldy title.

Payne &amp; Patrick McKay <a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-most-anticipated-new-series-of-2022-r">said in a statement</a>. “<em>The Rings of Power </em>unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Until now, audiences have only seen onscreen the story of the One Ring — but before there was one, there were many... and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The video shows what looks like a few valleys with wispy fog before we see what&#39;s actually going on.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22891031/tonga-volcano-eruption-broke-undersea-internet-cable-repair"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Tonga government has <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768">warned</a> internet access is &quot;down&quot; following damage to the lone undersea fiber optic cable keeping the archipelago online. While the country didn&#39;t provide an initial estimate, the Southern Cross Cable Network&#39;s Craige Sloots told <em>Reuters</em> it might take as long as two weeks to repair the cable &quot;all things going well.&quot;</p><p>It will take the repair ship up to nine days to travel from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, according to Sloots. The timing for the repair will also hinge on safety clearance and any lingering activity from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&#39;apai volcano. The 514-mile cable is secured through a Fiji relay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tonga has been somewhat prepared for incidents like this. It struck a 15-year agreement for satellite internet access with Kacific in 2019 after damage to the underwater cable. However, <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/">learned</a> a contract dispute with Kacific kept that access from being activated.

Nowadays, it&#39;s not just patties that can do a convincing impersonation of animal products, and it&#39;s not just Impossible Foods. Between Impossible and its biggest competitor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/beyond%20meat/">Beyond Meat</a>, we&#39;ve also seen plant-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-chicken-nuggets-190923352.html">chicken nuggets</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-sausage-nationwide-restaurants-yelp-diner-160015325.html">sausage</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-plant-based-pork-restaurants-us-hong-kong-singapore-233051113.html">pork</a>, &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/beyond-meat-chicken-kfc-nationwide-162015106.html">KFC</a>&quot; and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/taco-bell-beyond-meat-2021-222304025.html">taco meat</a>. But you don&#39;t often hear about attempts to mimic a different animal-based product: milk.</p><p>And when you do hear of plant-based milks, it&#39;s more likely to be dairy alternatives like almond milk, soy milk or oat milk. Even then, it&#39;s rare for a dairy-free version to taste like the real thing. That’s exactly the selling point of Silk’s new line of plant-based milk, Nextmilk. It will be available in both full fat and reduced fat versions (MSRP is $4.99 for a 59-ounce carton). It’s going on sale today in grocery stores like Target, Kroger, Publix and HEB, among others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I tried a sample of <a href="https://goto.target.com/QOGXXM">Silk’s Nextmilk</a> last week and while it’s tasty, I wasn’t fooled into thinking it tastes like cow&#39;s milk. It tastes more like a richer, fattier version of oat milk. It does have a similar creamy mouthfeel to regular milk and the taste is a little closer to dairy than other plant-based milks I’ve tried, but it doesn’t quite replace dairy for me.</p><p>The ingredients list reflect what I tasted: It consists primarily of oat milk, plus smaller proportions of coconut milk, coconut oil, soy protein isolate, chicory root extract, cane sugar, sunflower oil, a vitamin and mineral blend, sea salt, locust bean gum, gellan gum, sunflower lecithin, soy lecithin and “natural flavor.”</p><p>Still, it’s quite delicious, and it might be close enough to dairy for some people. When eaten with cereal or as an accompaniment to cookies, for example, I thought Nextmilk was a more than acceptable substitute. It also mixes well in coffee and tea. “Silk Nextmilk was specially formulated to meet dairy-lovers’ taste expectations through a remarkably delicious blend of plants that are designed to deliver on key attributes of dairy milk, like taste and texture,&#39;&#39; a Danone (Silk’s parent company) spokesperson told Engadget.</p><p>Additionally, Danone says that Nextmilk can be used as a one-to-one alternative to traditional dairy milk in recipes. At the same time, however, the company is also working on another product called So Delicious Wondermilk, which arrives next month and was specifically developed for culinary purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“While Silk Nextmilk is meant for everyday dairy lovers and offers great versatility [...] Wondermilk beverages were developed with culinary-focused consumers in mind and taste great in recipes,” the spokesperson said. When it arrives, Wondermilk will only be available through natural food channels like Whole Foods and Sprouts.&nbsp;</p><p>Danone is not the first to attempt a dairy-free alternative that tastes closer to real milk. Impossible Foods, the company behind the Impossible Burger, is also working on this, with a product tentatively called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-milk-154404741.html">Impossible Milk</a>. However, its availability is still unknown.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/silk-nextmilk-150024732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f5f7bcde-db66-4dcb-9cf3-0cb90c2f3ed1</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600278</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nutrition]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Backbone One made cloud gaming on the iPhone feel natural]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether it’s Xbox Cloud gaming, Stadia, PlayStation Remote Play or just a very severe addiction to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html">Apple Arcade</a>, gamepads are a better way to play many games on your smartphone of choice. Normally that means using some kind of smartphone clip to attach your phone to your existing controller, propping up your phone and hoping for the best, or choosing from an increasing selection of controllers that snap directly onto your phone. Instead of demanding compatible phone cases or separate pieces that connect either side of the phone, the $100 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Backbone One" href="https://amzn.to/33uO8kp">Backbone One</a> is a single-piece controller that extends to fit it.</p><p>Unlike the Razer Kishi, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-smartphone-game-controller-android-review-150009052.html">we tested in detail here</a>, the One is a single device with a telescopic backplate that fits around any iPhone. (With some help: the One isn’t compatible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. Backbone has, however, started providing a soft rubberized adapter that slides into the controller, ensuring the latest, bigger iPhones fit snugly and securely.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572460-7925-11ec-b4bb-c61945547d2b" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="9a93d5c7-60a2-3f21-8b7c-6c96fefb3420"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>So why invest in another controller for your phone when most mainstream console gamepads you probably already own already do the job? There are a few reasons. Backbone One, with its direct Lightning connection, sidesteps the extra jeopardy that comes with Bluetooth-connected controllers, which introduce another latency bump in the road. The company has wisely included a charger pass-through (gaming can burn through your battery) so you can keep your phone plugged in as you play.</p><p>The device has a subtle matte black finish, with two collar buttons on each side, a four-button layout on the right side (X, Y, A, B), a slightly-too-spongy d-pad on the left and an analog stick on each side. The sticks feel a little looser than others I’ve used, but they’re accurate and comfortable.</p><p>Backbone struck a deal with Microsoft, offering a one-month trial of Xbox’s Game Pass Ultimate for new Backbone owners. It said so on the box, it says it in the app, and it’ll say it in an email if you register the controller. You will get the hint.</p><p>The button layout does lean more towards Xbox gamers, but my PlayStation muscle memory meant I didn’t have too many issues using the One to play my PS5 remotely – just the usual drawbacks of playing with a controller that isn’t a DualSense, with its unique tricks and features. Using the touchpad will mean reaching for a section of the iPhone screen, while you’re not going to get any haptic feedback from the triggers or controller itself.</p><p>There are a handful of buttons in addition to the stable gaming ones. The orange button launches Backbone’s own game portal (part of the BackBone iOS app), while others offer screen and video sharing shortcuts or what you’d expect when pressing start or menu on console controllers.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c5fd10eb1199462a9bf7e94a78ba500b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572461-7925-11ec-bffb-f879e7253d34" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="3da1c316-a661-397c-85c3-c525f0d3bdb8"></section><p>The controller’s namesake, the spring-loaded backplate, ensures that once your phone is in place, it all feels solid and unified. The controls aren’t going to pull away, nor is there a chance of your phone slipping out. The more I spent playing through <em>Alan Wake</em>, then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, as well as Apple Arcade titles like <em>Fallen Knight </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-fantasian-interview-apple-arcade-150022942.html"><em>Fantasian</em></a>, the more it started to blur into a handheld – one with a high-resolution OLED screen. Unfortunately, you will have to remove any cases to ensure it fits inside the controller chassis.</p><p>The companion app has a few useful tricks. It can capture, edit and upload gaming content, and it’s pretty intuitive. I don’t usually capture gameplay unless it’s for work, but I’ve already used Backbone’s implementation to send short clips to friends. The company has also announced a Backbone+ subscription service that integrates Twitch streaming and even enables cable connections for keyboards and more. (You’ll get a free year of the service when buying the controller.) There’s also the ability to join chat groups and lobbies, populated with other Backbone gamers, but it’s not particularly vibrant in comparison to Discord, Reddit or other existing gamer spaces.</p><p></p><p>The app also serves as a games library, of sorts, of all the games you can play with the Backbone One, across Xbox, Stadia, Apple Arcade and individual games in Apple’s App Store. Unfortunately, it’s literally all the compatible games, including unremarkable game clones, and Xbox and Stadia titles you might not even have a subscription for. It’s a shame the app couldn’t interface with which games I’d already installed – which would be impossible for PlayStation Remote Play, admittedly. Tapping the Backbone button during a game will log the title into the library for more convenient access next time, at least. There’s deeper functionality here, but your mileage may vary. It will show recommendations of popular titles, but it’s the incredibly familiar sights of <em>Among Us, Genshin Impact </em>and<em> Minecraft.</em></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="e01f2dd7-b395-337c-b999-4152d836ba30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>The Backbone One is a capable iPhone gamepad, so much in fact that sometimes I actively choose to play Stadia and even remote-play PlayStation when I’m in another room. It is, however, an expensive one. $100 can buy a couple of PS5 controllers, or an entire box of third-party Bluetooth gamepads and smartphone clips.</p><p>But for that price, you get a slick experience that marries well with your iPhone. Over the holidays, when I visited my family, I was able to effortlessly (aside from reading the tiny text) play <em>Deathloop</em> while being hundreds of miles away from my console. Like several existing split gamer pads for smartphones, it’s like a tiny Switch. The app also tries to pool together all your iOS gaming experiences in a single place, which is a nice idea, even if Backbone doesn’t quite nail the execution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868c6867-d0b7-498e-ae23-9183bfb0866a</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600735</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e44f8410-7925-11ec-bcf6-da9b33ed53cc" width="1716" height="1144" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/ Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's latest mobile games include an open-world card battler]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is still relatively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-mobile-stranger-things-android-ios-171232076.html">new to mobile gaming</a>, but that isn&#39;t stopping it from quickly releasing new titles. <em>What&#39;s on Netflix</em><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/">notes</a> the streaming service has unveiled two new titles for subscribers.

The collection should become more substantial over time, though, and this might reduce the temptation to skip a month when you&#39;ve run out of things to watch.</p><div id="d774afa8fb3a47ffa0b1a7ae7a0b154f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1kQyJg6DZ8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-arcanium-krispee-street-mobile-games-141533991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2acb3664-eb2e-4a3f-b7ad-74470f92f4c8</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:15:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642601318</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T14:08:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5afd9ef0-792e-11ec-987d-d34122ababf2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5afd9ef0-792e-11ec-987d-d34122ababf2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Supercombo/Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Arcanium' game from Netflix on iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Arcanium' game from Netflix on iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iRobot's Roomba 694 is back down to a record low of $179]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A robot vacuum can help you stick to that New Year&#39;s resolution you made to keep your home a bit more tidy — and it helps that you don&#39;t have to spend a fortune to get one of these gadgets anymore. There are many more budget-friendly robot vacuums available today than there were even just a couple of years ago, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1">iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694</a> is one of the better ones we&#39;ve tried. Normally priced at $274, the affordable robo-vac is even cheaper right now on Amazon where it&#39;s $95 off and down to $179. That&#39;s the same price we saw during the Black Friday shopping season last year, so if you missed the gadget when it was previously on sale, you have another chance to grab it now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1" id="e4e46e5ceba74cfb90f012066527e62a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179</a><p>This is one of iRobot&#39;s entry-level vacuums with a three-button design, mobile app connectivity and the ability to clean both hard and carpeted surfaces well. It earned a spot in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> for those reasons — not only does it do a good job puttering around your home, sucking up dirt and debris along the way, but we also like that you can control it using the on-device buttons or the companion mobile app. iRobot&#39;s app is pretty straightforward, so even if you&#39;re a newbie to the world of autonomous cleaning robots, it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to figure out. The app also lets you set cleaning schedules, which tell the Roomba to automatically clean on certain days of the week and at specific times. The Roomba 694 is also compatible with Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can control it with voice commands, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba 694 is a great option if you want to introduce a robo-vac into your home without dropping too much money. iRobot also has a number of more advanced machines if you&#39;re looking to invest in a vacuum with more power and smarts. The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba j7+" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO">Roomba j7+</a> is on sale for $599 right now, which is $250 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen. It has 10x the suction power of the 694 plus Precision View Navigation with obstacle avoidance, the latter of which is the reason why iRobot dubbed the machine its &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; robot. It also comes with a clean base, so the robo-vac will automatically empty its bin into that base after every job so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA">Roomba s9+</a> is also $250 off and down to $849. It has 40x the suction of a standard Roomba, a design that can more easily clean in room corners and an included clean base. While it&#39;s probably overkill for most people, it&#39;s the model to get if you want one of the highest-end robot vacuums around.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO" id="65c4acf847454d5a8b4a7d2093f4b247" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $599</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA" id="44ecdeff9f1249feb27819957ab4be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba S9+ at Amazon - $849</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-694-is-back-down-to-a-record-low-of-179-140530376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3943a458-f33c-43c8-b2e9-ba37d414b7dc</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:05:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600730</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
