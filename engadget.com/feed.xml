What falls under the definition of health-related misinformation would be decided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The exception would only apply during a public health crisis, which the HMS Secretary would have to declare beforehand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In establishing a rationale for the change, the bill cites a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html">joint report</a> from the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Anti-Vax Watch that found that as much 73 percent of vaccine misinformation on Facebook can be linked to a group of 12 individuals known as the &quot;disinformation dozen.&quot; White House Press Secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1415725645875740672">Jen Psaki</a> recently referenced that same report, saying that many of those individuals are still active on the social network.</p><p>&quot;For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans. These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,&quot; Senator Klobuchar said in a statement. &quot;The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be and it is our responsibility to take action.&quot;</p><p>The bill&#39;s introduction also follows a recent statement made by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">President Joe Biden</a>. He said platforms like Facebook were &quot;killing people&quot; by not doing more to stop vaccine- and health-related misinformation. &quot;We will not be distracted by accusations which aren&#39;t supported by facts,&quot; a spokesperson for Facebook told Engadget after Biden made his comments. &quot;The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.&quot; The president later walked back his statement, noting the people using the platform to spread their misinformation were the ones doing harm but reiterated his belief that Facebook could do more to combat what was happening.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/health-misinformation-act-2021-204010072.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8e606a-5d37-4d27-bd1a-cc778881cdc1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 20:40:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626986535</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T20:42:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64488f10-eb2b-11eb-9ff3-ff8d606cc1bf" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64488f10-eb2b-11eb-9ff3-ff8d606cc1bf" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ATLANTA, GA - JULY 19: U.S. Sen.

But it didn&#39;t change the price, which means you&#39;ll still pay at least $179 for it. However, Amazon has a new deal that knocks nearly $20 off the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:64GB Apple TV 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3kMMnFA">64GB Apple TV 4K</a>, bringing it down to $180.

It runs on an A12 Bionic processor and it supports Dolby Vision and HDR video at 60fps, plus features like AirPlay 3 and screen mirroring. While navigating the interface of tvOS is a zippy experience, most people probably won&#39;t notice a huge performance difference between the old and new models.</p><p>What&#39;s really key to the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV 4K</a> is the redesigned Siri remote. Now, we&#39;re not saying the new remote is reason enough to upgrade if you&#39;re happy with your current Apple TV, but it does fix a lot of previous complaints we had. The new Siri remote is larger and easier to use, thanks in part to a revamped directional pad that makes controlling the gadget much smoother. The pad is also touch sensitive, so you can swipe between TV show and movie options more easily. We also found Siri to be even more useful on a device like the Apple TV, since queries tend to be more direct (&quot;Play <em>The Mandalorian</em>&quot; or &quot;Show me some new horror movies&quot;) than they are when calling upon the assistant from an iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Speaking of Siri commands, you can also ask the assistant on the Apple TV 4K to show you video feeds from your security cameras. The set-top box has a HomeKit hub built in, so you can connect various smart lights, locks and cameras to it. Video feeds from cameras, for example, will show up on your TV in picture-in-picture mode, so it won&#39;t totally interrupt the show you&#39;re watching.</p><p>The Apple TV 4K will be a tough sell for some since it&#39;s more expensive that competing streaming boxes (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Ultra" href="https://amzn.to/2UvT18w">Roku Ultra</a> is only $100, and often on sale for less), but those who spend most of their time with Apple products will find its conveniences and integrations worthwhile. Plus, Apple&#39;s rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">spatial audio to tvOS</a> later this year, which means you&#39;ll be able to get full Dolby Atmos sound from the Apple TV 4K when listening with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-2021-new-siri-remote-deal-amazon-181228166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a2bf95a-d817-47e6-90d7-a54cdbf81ef5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:12:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626977550</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T18:12:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Dead Space' is being remade for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Dead Space</em> is getting a new chance at life.

Today, the secret&#39;s out. Battlefield Portal is the third mode in <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, and it&#39;s all about community interaction and user-created levels.</p><p>Battlefield Portal includes all seven maps from <em>2042</em>&#39;s All-Out Warfare mode, plus six classic environments from previous Battlefield titles. The classic maps are Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein from <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, Arica Harbor and Valparaiso from <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em>, and Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals from <em>Battlefield 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0188700-eb10-11eb-8fff-1c3463e43aca" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="36173e80-41e3-33ae-9128-0690a77f542d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>The mode features pre-programmed, reimagined experiences from these past titles, including conquest, rush and team deathmatch. All of the maps, including the classic ones, will support matches of up to 128 players on PC, Xbox Series consoles and PlayStation 5. As with <em>Battlefield 2042</em>&#39;s main All-Out Warfare mode, matches on older-gen hardware will be capped at 64 players.</p><p>Here&#39;s where it gets <em>custom</em>. Along with the updated, old-school playgrounds, Battlefield Portal includes more than 40 weapons, more than 40 vehicles, and more than 30 gadgets from three theaters of war, plus all of the related content from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. This means the M1 Garand, Panzerschreck, B17 Bomber, Spitfire, defibrillator and other fan-favorite tools are back.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e01cccc0-eb10-11eb-afed-28891fa33b79" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="5499ac24-f8f0-3f08-9d71-0ac3fe99e007"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Factions are also returning to Battlefield Portal. On top of the specialists from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, the mode features seven armies from the classic games, including the UK, US and Germany out of <em>1942</em>, and the US and Russia from <em>Bad Company 2</em>. Battlefield Portal also supports classic soldier archetypes like <em>Battlefield 3</em>&#39;s assault, recon, support and engineer roles.</p><p>All of this culminates in the Builder tool in Battlefield Portal. In Builder, players can design their own matches and share them with the community, adjusting a range of settings including the game logic itself. Players will have control over the maps and modes in their custom games, including traits like available factions, weapons and gear; the ability to toggle down sights or go prone; the size of the battle and conditions for victory.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0144140-eb10-11eb-bbb4-5de70f586e77" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="7ff3a026-e81b-3847-ba21-bf4d04d6dd20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Players won&#39;t be able to edit any of the actual maps, but overall, Portal has an extremely rich customization mode. All progress in Battlefield Portal is shared across consoles, just like stats in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Battlefield 2042</em> — including Battlefield Portal — is due out on October 22nd, for $60 on PC, Xbox One and PS4, and $70 on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. There&#39;s still one more game mode yet to be revealed, Hazard Zone. We know it&#39;s a &quot;high-stakes squad-based game type never seen before in the Battlefield franchise,&quot; and it&#39;s not a battle royale mode, but that&#39;s about it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-portal-mode-customs-180008313.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a907da5-9322-49ad-8e5b-71cf2c11dce6</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626976424</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T17:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 - Battlefield Portal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next Grid game uses the same virtual set tech as 'The Mandalorian']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/codemasters"><ins>Codemasters</ins></a> offered the first look at the next Grid game during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html"><ins>EA Play Live</ins></a>. <em>Grid Legends</em> features a story mode that mashes together live-action performances and in-game action.

In fact, he&#39;s so optimistic about the cryptocurrency, he reckons it could bring about a more peaceful planet. The billionaire suggested bitcoin could help address financial inequalities and allow humanity to concentrate on bigger issues.</p><p>“My hope is that it creates world peace or helps create world peace,” Dorsey said. “We have all these monopolies off balance and the individual doesn’t have power and the amount of cost and distraction that comes from our monetary system today is real and it takes away attention from the bigger problems.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“All these distractions that we have to deal with on a daily basis take away from those bigger goals that affect every single person on this planet and increasingly so,&quot; he said, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/jack-dorsey-hopes-bitcoin-will-help-bring-about-world-peace.html"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes. &quot;You fix that foundational level and everything above it improves in such a dramatic way. It’s going to be long-term but my hope is definitely peace.&quot;</p><p>He made the comments during a panel called <a href="https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment">&quot;bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment&quot;</a> at a virtual conference called The B Word. Tesla CEO and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doge-musk-233459058.html">crypto market mover</a> Elon Musk and Cathie Wood, chief executive of Square stakeholder ARK Invest, also took part in the discussion.</p><p>Dorsey <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years">spoke in 2018</a> of his belief that bitcoin would become the planet’s “single currency&quot; within a decade. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-033027788.html">Square confirmed plans</a> to make a bitcoin hardware wallet. Dorsey also said last week the company is building a “decentralized financial services” business that aims to replicate monetary systems like banks and exchanges with cryptocurrency.</p><p>There are many hurdles standing between the current state of crypto and the potential for it leading to world peace, such as unreliable internet access in many regions. The power consumption required for bitcoin mining and to process transactions are also at odds with Dorsey’s vision, given the environmental impact of many cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Musk said Tesla would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-221708146.html">stop taking bitcoin payments</a> for vehicles because it was &quot;concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions.&quot; However, he noted during this week&#39;s conference that Tesla may resume such payments. &quot;I wanted a little bit more due diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50%, and that there is a trend towards increasing that number, and if so Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin,&quot; <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/tesla-will-most-likely-restart-accepting-bitcoin-as-payments-says-musk-1.5518909">he said</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-world-peace-171030828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">790cfefc-3664-4539-9fac-c0d5dcebfb20</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:10:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626982201</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T19:30:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8a042e00-8e36-11eb-9b3b-ed25a3476562" width="974" height="548" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8a042e00-8e36-11eb-9b3b-ed25a3476562" width="974" height="548" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies during a remote video hearing held by subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on "Social Media's Role in Promoting Extremism and Misinformation" in Washington, U.S., March 25, 2021.

If you’re going to get both, it makes more sense to just get the Playdate and Cover bundle, which is priced at $199. As for the recently announced Playdate Stereo Dock, however, that isn’t ready for pre-orders just yet as it’s still in development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a press release, Panic said that the first batch of Playdate units, which should be around 20,000, will start shipping by the end of this year. After selling this initial allotment, it will then ship subsequent orders in 2022. The company also wanted to assure customers that the Playdate will never “sell out;” you’ll just have to wait in line, as the production is adjusted based on demand.</p><p>Pre-orders will require payment upfront, but Panic says it can be cancelled at any time for a full refund. Orders are limited to two units per person. The Playdate will ship initially to the following countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. It’s also looking into selling the devices in Malaysia, where the factory is located (if you’re in Malaysia, you can fill out <a href="https://panic-inc.typeform.com/to/dyaeItXv">this form</a> so Panic can keep you posted). International shipping costs will include any duties or taxes.</p><p>If you still can’t get enough Playdate, Panic also announced that it’s debuting a new Playdate-focused podcast next week that will give you a lot more background and information about the little handheld gaming console.

The company recently announced that the Playdate will be <a href="http://play.date/">available for pre-order</a> on July 29th for $179, with a ship date of later this year. I’ve been playing with a “press preview” version of the Playdate for the past couple of weeks, and while it’s not perfect, I still think it’s an incredibly charming handheld with a lot of potential. The question is whether there’ll be enough interest — from both developers and consumers — to keep it going for the long haul.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f2756935-7bec-48db-aff9-d8139c2d00e7"/><p>For the uninitiated, the Playdate is not just Panic’s first-ever gaming handheld; it’s also the company’s first piece of hardware, period. Panic made its name making Mac software like Transmit and Coda, and has recently ventured into publishing indie games such as <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> and the yet-to-be-released <em>Nour: Play With Your Food</em>. From its inception, Panic wanted Playdate to be a different kind of handheld; instead of something mainstream like Nintendo’s Switch, it was supposed to be more like the Game &amp; Watch devices of yore, but with a modern twist. “We didn’t want it to be too cool, but we didn’t want it to be too goofy,” said Cabel Sasser, Panic’s co-founder.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thanks to a design collaboration with Teenage Engineering, known mostly for making quirky audio gear, the Playdate certainly fulfills that brief. The hardware is tiny; about the size of a stack of Post-It notes (76 x 74 x 9 mm), and has a black-and-white screen. But its most unique design feature is its fold-out crank, which acts as an additional game controller. It’s this combination of silly and adorable that adds to the Playdate’s charm, and I’ll fully admit that I fell for it the first time I tried a prototype back in 2019.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17733a20-eac0-11eb-bd7b-d2a821ab0f00" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="13493ee1-697d-35d0-8f05-2b4aff147182"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The aforementioned preview unit I have on-hand is the final hardware, though the software isn’t quite there yet. Everything is similar to how it was two years ago. The button placement is the same, with the D-pad and A and B buttons under the display, the menu button on the right, and the lock button sitting on the top (you activate the Playdate by pressing the lock button twice; pressing it again will enable standby mode). All the controls feel responsive enough, with a pleasant clickiness. On the side is the mono speaker, which is surprisingly loud and clear given its size. Underneath is a 3.5mm headphone jack plus a USB-C charging port.</p><p>Most important to me, however, was that crank, which is housed on the Playdate’s right side. To access it, simply flip it open to reveal a small rotating yellow handle, which you can then use to rotate the arm backwards or forwards. The whole contraption feels a lot more solid than I remember; the rotation feels silky smooth, but it isn’t so loose that it continues to spin when I let go. This is a good thing, as it allows for more precise control, which turns out to be quite important in certain games. Internally, the Playdate has a 180 MHz Cortex M7 CPU, 16MB of RAM, 4GB of Flash storage, Bluetooth, and 802.11 bgn 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>The Playdate is molded from what Panic says is an extremely durable engineering thermoplastic, and the screen is laminated to a hardened glass face. That aforementioned crank is also pretty solid; it’s made out of stainless steel, and the handle is plastic with a stainless steel core. The Playdate will likely survive the occasional jostle in your pocket or bag. But if you want to keep it completely free of blemishes, Panic does offer a cover for $29 (You could also purchase the Playdate bundled with the cover for $199).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d7efed0-eac0-11eb-bbfd-b5d151f35301" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="53cdb6d1-7a94-31fd-bfff-edcd79eb95d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>While I do like the hardware for the most part, I have to admit I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the screen. One of the reasons Panic chose to go with a Sharp Memory LCD was because of its super-sharp pixels that use very little power (Pebble aficionados might recall that its eponymous smartwatch used Sharp Memory LCDs as well). I agree that the black and white images do look very crisp, especially in bright sunlight. However, the Playdate lacks any kind of backlight or front light, which means it’s terrible in dim environments. Maybe it’s because I live and work in a relatively dark room, but I found this rather annoying. At one point I had to position a book light underneath the Playdate just to play a game on the couch.</p><p>I should note that the Playdate does last a long time in between charges. I’ve left it unplugged for nearly two weeks now, and even though I’ve played a few hours every day, it still has over half of its battery life left.</p><p>I also noticed an “Upside Down” mode in the Settings menu, which turns the screen, well, upside down. When asked, Sasser said that this is an experimental mode for left-handed users who want to use the crank with their left hands. He did say, however, that this is feature is still subject to change.</p><p>As wonderful as the hardware is, the real value of the Playdate is the content. Though the device costs $179, it will now come with 24 different titles instead of the initial 12 (it’ll also ship with 4GB of storage instead of 2). My preview unit only came with four games however: <em>Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure</em>, <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, <em>Saturday Edition </em>and <em>Whitewater Wipeout</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4bd93a80-eac0-11eb-bfed-b43cad792d9e" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="851100a8-7ddc-3935-a581-cfc68142cdd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I had already played <em>Crankin</em>’ a couple of years ago when I tried the Playdate for the first time. Designed by Katamari Damacy’s Keita Takahashi, the only controller in this game is the crank, which you’ll use to hurry Crankin along his path to meet his girlfriend, Crankette. Spinning it forward will move him forward, while spinning it backward will get Crankin to do the same. The trick is that you have to navigate various obstacles like bees and birds, which exist outside the flow of time. So as you rush along, you have to position Crankin in such a way that he can avoid them. For example, you’ll want Crankin to bend down to smell the flowers exactly when the bees fly overhead.</p><p>That might seem like a relatively easy premise, but the obstacles get more complicated as the levels progress, forcing me to replay them several times before I can get them right. Currently, I’m stuck on level five despite multiple attempts. Guess I’m not going to see Crankette any time soon.</p><p>I much prefer <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, which was designed by Sweet Baby Inc &amp; Friends. In this game, a girl named Prota is going to work for a cat scientist named Marbels (no that’s not a typo), but unwittingly brings her dog Minty along on her first day. Let’s just say that things don’t go well, and Minty eventually goes missing. Somehow, Prota also, uh, loses her “marbles” in the process. As Prota goes around town trying to find her dog, you answer questions by using the crank to roll a marble around an obstacle-filled construction, making sure that the marble hits the answer you want (It’s not explicitly said, but my guess is that the marble puzzle here represents Prota’s brain).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63dab4b0-eac0-11eb-bd9d-cdf334d8b531" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="eaa6c4e4-69ab-3756-9a65-ee24b76690f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I found it a little tricky to control the marble, so I ended up picking a lot of what I thought were incorrect answers. But I soon found out that there’s really no such thing as the wrong answer in this game. That’s because the weirder the answer, the more hilarious the story becomes. For example, when you’re picking the photo for Minty’s missing dog poster, one of the options is for her butt. I didn’t mean to select it, but I did so accidentally. I know this all sounds incredibly silly, and it is, but I also found the whole thing very amusing.</p><p><em>Saturday Edition</em>, on the other hand, is a lot more serious, at least on the surface. Developed by Chris Makris, this is a point-and-click style adventure game which doesn’t use the crank at all. Instead, all navigation is done via the D-pad and A and B buttons. In this game, you play the character of John Kornfield who’s had a long history with aliens, but is currently on Earth.</p><p>The game opens with him in his apartment, and the cops are knocking on the door. Using the controls, you’re able to interact with various elements in the apartment like listening to the answering machine or opening the microwave. The game suggested to me that it’s a lot wiser to exit the apartment via the fire escape instead, so I did. I’ll admit that I haven’t gotten very far in this game — I’ve so far only been to his office and the nearby shopping mall. I do find the story quite intriguing so far, but I’m going to have to sink in a few more hours before I uncover all the game’s secrets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98354360-eac0-11eb-bdf8-066e86715df8" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="4618d6d3-b649-3954-9e80-33235a5bfc54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Last but not least is <em>Whitewater Wipeout, </em>by Chuhai Labs. All you have to do here is surf for as long as possible, performing tricks along the way to earn points. Like <em>Crankin</em>, the only controller here is the crank, which you’ll use to move the surfboard. The highest score I’ve achieved so far is 35, which is not great at all. There will eventually be a global leaderboard which you can use to compare your skills to others.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, my favorite games are the ones with a heavy story element, such as <em>Lost Your Marbles</em> and <em>Saturday Edition</em>. I am not very good with hand-eye coordination, so <em>Crankin</em>’ and <em>Wipeout</em> are not really my thing. I’ll also add that after a week or so of playing the same four games over and over, I got bored pretty quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, however, the Playdate will definitely be getting more games. As part of its $179 price, the console actually comes bundled with a season’s worth of titles — 24 games in total. The first two games will start downloading the moment you activate your Playdate, and then you’ll get two games every Monday thereafter for 11 weeks.</p><p>That is, fundamentally, the sticking point with any console like this — as quirky and glorious as the hardware is, it’ll live and die in the amount of new games you can add to this on a regular basis. The indie gaming community has already embraced the Playdate wholeheartedly — tens of thousands of developers have already expressed interest in making games for it — and the company announced that they’ll be able to sell software and games that can be sideloaded to the device.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Playdate is a fairly niche device — it’s an indie handheld made for indie games — and that’s the very thing that is so appealing about it. But it’s unclear if interest in the Playdate will last beyond its initial release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/playdate-preview-170047433.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e1ecfbc-7157-4e42-93dd-f60cf005936c</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626972399</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T16:47:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Large chunks of the internet went down due a DNS issue]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you can&#39;t access online services like Sony&#39;s PlayStation Network and Steam, as well as websites like Airbnb, you&#39;re not the only one.

The attacks made it so that people in the US and parts of Europe couldn&#39;t access websites like Amazon, GitHub, PayPal and Reddit for almost an entire day.

Still, that leaves many devotees without a path to Wear OS 3 short of buying new wristwear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update will also be opt-in for a reason. The &quot;extent of changes&quot; in Wear OS 3 will require that you reset your watch to factory settings — not surprisingly, Google wants to ask nicely before wiping your device. While this reset won&#39;t be as huge a setback as it would be if it were your phone, you&#39;ll want to think carefully before moving forward.</p><p>The hardware cutoff isn&#39;t a complete shock. Many Wear OS watches on the market are using the three-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-10-qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-3100.html">Snapdragon Wear 3100</a>, and even the much-improved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Wear 4100</a> has been around since 2020. Google might have needed to limit Wear OS 3&#39;s features to support aging processors. Whatever the rationale, this could result in a bumpy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-20-microsoft-unveils-windows-phone-7-8-for-legacy-devices.html">Windows Phone 8-style</a> transition where existing owners have to make difficult choices about when (or if) they replace their devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7914731-4bc9-4b73-8228-90eabee62952</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626960499</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:28:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing Engadget’s 2021 back-to-school gift guide!]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We know you may not be ready to go back to school just yet — but being prepared for the inevitable return can’t hurt.

Created by Nirav Patel, formerly of Oculus, the machine aims to demonstrate that there is a better, more sustainable way of doing things. It shouldn’t be that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-09-google-repair-ads.html">if your tech fails</a>, you either have to buy a new model, or let the manufacturer’s in-house <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/complete-control-apple-accused-of-overpricing-restricting-device-repairs-1.4859099">repair teams charge $700</a> for a job that should&#39;ve cost $50. After all, if we’re going to survive climate change, we need to treat our tech more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-08-apple-battery-iphone-warning.html">sustainably</a> and keep as much as possible out of the landfill.</p><p>It says so much about how consumer technology has changed over the last two decades that Framework even exists. The idea that a repairable, modular laptop is somehow a radical proposition is outrageous given what lurks inside. And some corners of the tech world may think that users will need to put up with agricultural performance and looks in exchange for longevity. That’s why the best word I can use to describe Framework’s first, eponymous, machine is <em>uncontroversial</em>. The only time you’ll need to understand that this machine is repairable, is if it breaks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e9c61-e940-11eb-9d3f-57263f2cba67" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b46a62c5-47e9-36ae-9f0d-1ef30a9337aa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that Framework hasn’t invented the repairable laptop, or even the idea of modular expansion ports. The latter was common in laptops through to the late ‘00s and, even today, many enterprise laptops from the likes of HP and Lenovo have clear, detailed repair guides and easy-to-access spare parts. Framework isn’t claiming credit that it doesn’t deserve, but it is here, much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-plus-hands-on-090004841.html">Fairphone</a>, to show everyone that we shouldn’t tolerate the default.</p><p>There’s nothing spectacular, eye-catching or otherwise attention-seeking about the design of the first Framework laptop. Walk past it in a hurry and you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for any other 13-inch notebook made in the last half a decade. The aluminum body (made with up to 50 percent post-consumer recycled aluminum) makes it look like an old-school MacBook. From the front, it’s unmistakably a Windows laptop, but again, there are no steampunk flexes here. It’s only when you’re looking at it off-angle that you can tell something’s different.</p><h3>I/O</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2731-e940-11eb-b3ef-de2f3923b996" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="cb038618-09d2-3ff9-a873-0ddaa896604d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Rather than having ports stacked tight at the top of the mainboard, each side of Framework’s deck has two wide voids. Peer inside and you’ll see a USB-C port just visible buried deep in the machine’s guts. These voids are designed to house four “expansion cards” which can be swapped in depending on your need (so long as you press the release button on the bottom).</p><p>Each card offers a single port, connecting to the laptop over USB-C, and is designed to eliminate the need for a dedicated dongle. In the standard setup, you’ll get a quartet of USB-C cards — and you’ll need at least one for charging — but there are a number of others available. That includes options for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI and a microSD Card reader. You can also order an expansion card with additional external storage, with 250GB costing $69, and 1TB setting you back $149. Framework says that users can lobby for different cards in future, so all of those folks grousing for a full-size SD-card reader can get cracking.</p><p>Nestled between the ports is a small, white LED which lets you know when the machine is connected to power. Oh, and there’s a dedicated 3.5mm audio jack.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c1-e940-11eb-baf3-f6841a03021f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b3b6e59e-f180-3b0c-b419-2709465e1c36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>My one complaint about the look of this thing is that the sides of the deck artificially taper in to make it look thinner than it really is. Because the base flares out underneath almost immediately, it looks a bit like it’s cheating. It would have been nicer if Framework had embraced the pleasant squareness of its design, rather than trying to disguise it.</p><p>In terms of build quality, the only thing to add is that the machine has a lot more flex than its contemporaries. This is, broadly speaking, the one benefit of these all-in-one, glue-heavy machines which are difficult to repair. The Framework, by comparison, squeaks and creaks when you twist the case, and you can see the dividing line between the keyboard and the rest of the deck as you do so.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display is lovely, and I feel like these days displays are so hard to mess up that there’s little more you can say about them. The backlight will push up to 400 nits, which is certainly the standard you’d expect from laptops in this class. Given that this machine is designed for productivity work you’re not going to come away with bleeding eyes if you stare at this for hours each day.</p><h3>Keyboard and Trackpad</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d05ac0-e940-11eb-ad9b-d6d7a343aa3f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="c2aac9ca-63ca-379f-833f-4d25aee5b17a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework, from the outset, made it clear that it wanted to nail the fundamentals of what makes a good laptop. Naturally, a good keyboard is key, especially given how much time people will be spending on this thing each day. Here we’ve got an old-fashioned, uncontroversial chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and a soft (ish) landing. This was the standard for a good keyboard a decade ago, and little has changed, although the landing here is a little bit<em> too</em> soft. Clearly, this is a machine that won’t irritate other people when you’re typing on the train, but the quiet key presses come at the expense of some sharpness.</p><p>The trackpad, meanwhile, is similarly standard-issue, it’s a good size, with a satisfying click when you push it down and it’s reactive when you tap it. It couldn’t be much bigger given the size of the laptop’s deck, nor is it obtrusively placed. This is a satisfying thing to use, and I found myself defaulting to it rather than to my mouse, which almost never happens.</p><h3>Webcam and Audio</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd3-e940-11eb-bf4f-94c96dc9c062" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="dbe24dd1-00df-3258-8bd5-2b334bdeb321"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Framework laptop is equipped with a 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view, and it’s one of the best built-in webcams I’ve seen. Founder Nirav Patel told me that he had always intended to use a high-quality webcam, and felt vindicated by the pandemic. And either side of the webcam are hardware privacy switches to disable both the webcam and the microphone. These are “soft” switches that cut power to those components rather than physically obscuring the lens, and putting them on the top bezel is a strong flex, but not one I’m opposed to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d48c37f0-e940-11eb-9f5e-e706411fb739" alt="ISNT HE SMOULDERING " data-uuid="8400f32d-c48e-3355-ac63-fa417b3ef3e0"><figcaption>Isn&#39;t he smouldering?</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I have fewer nice things to say about the side-firing 2W speakers that are broadly, generically, sort-of okay. The sound coming out of them is tinny, weak and muddy, with bass so weak that Budweiser seems strong in comparison. If you’re going to be using this as the center of your audio/visual world, then invest in a decent pair of speakers or headphones.</p><h2><strong>Performance and Battery Life</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c3-e940-11eb-9f7b-ef8ec241bd38" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="4c3e443a-fff9-3208-ab03-8073a17669f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The model that I’m testing is the $1,399 “Performance” model, which is packing Intel’s Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. All of the models, no matter the price, come with Intel’s Iris Xe graphics with no option for adding a discrete GPU. And certainly, in the week I used it, I don’t think I saw any lag or stuttering, and it handles undemanding games well enough. Benchmarks don’t tell the whole story, but in PC Mark 10’s standard score the machine averaged at 4927, outperforming a machine like the Surface Laptop 4.</p><p>As for battery life, I certainly didn’t find myself dashing for the nearest outlet while using this machine. In our standard rundown test, with display brightness set to 65 percent and an HD video looping, the Framework lasted 7 hours 46 minutes on its 55Wh battery. That’s enough to get you through a working day, but I would have vastly preferred it to crawl past that eight hour mark. A lot of machines in the 13-inch category can now get closer to 10 hours, and Intel’s Evo program insists upon it if your laptop has an HD-only display. The higher res screen probably offers Framework enough of a pass, but it’s something to bear in mind.</p><p>In terms of real-world performance, I spent about a week using Framework as my primary machine. Knocking around with Spotify open, several Chrome tabs and Slack all at once and I didn’t feel things dragging too much. A title like <em>Fortnite</em>, runs buttery-smooth on Medium settings and feels about right for this sort of work-first machine. Certainly, if you’re looking for a machine that can do work and (light) play, this will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with many ultrabooks in its class.</p><h2><strong>DIY</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2730-e940-11eb-a3fb-a6620b2122ff" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2310a383-67c9-39fa-8e8b-417809582170"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Like the modular, repairable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-3-plus-repair-camera-swap-153053319.html">Fairphone</a>, Framework ships with a Torx T5 screwdriver in the box, and every screw uses that same head. Five screws are all that connect the top of the laptop’s deck, containing the fingerprint sensor, keyboard and trackpad, to the rest of the base. Pull that off, and you can then gently pry off the display bezel, which is attached to the screen with a series of magnets.</p><p>Once inside, you’ll spot that every component is labeled, with a QR code which links to friendly, iFixit-style repair guides. Construction isn’t vastly different from any other laptop, the company hasn’t left big pockets of space to aid repairability. In many ways, this is the best thing that this machine can do: Show consumers (and manufacturers) that making laptops easy to repair is very easy… if you try.</p><p>Framework shipped with its default US keyboard but, in a separate package, the company sent over a UK-format keyboard and top deck. I didn’t need to change it, and ordinarily I wouldn’t start disassembling a review laptop, but Framework said people should feel free to “poke around in the guts of the project.” So, with a sense of giddy empowerment, I thought I might as well swap units to see how easy, and safe, it was to swap the keyboards.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d00ca0-e940-11eb-bfe6-54df372db068" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="38c017d9-cab2-3aec-aacf-e0d6b443c625"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Armed with my screwdriver and the documentation, I was able to unscrew the mounting bolts which hold the top deck to the rest. Once lifted off, I had to unplug one clearly labeled ribbon cable, pop the replacement keyboard back on and screw everything back together. This process took me three minutes and 54 seconds, which would have been half the time had I realized sooner that the screws were captive, and so were designed to be held inside the laptop’s body.</p><p>I have never felt more confident that I could repair this machine, and that this should be the default for all consumer laptops. Imagine, for instance, when a very famous laptop maker decided to use a different keyboard technology for its most popular machines. A keyboard technology that was found to be notoriously unreliable despite a number of revisions. Now imagine how many machines wouldn’t need to be sent back for repair, and the countless hours of working time lost to them, if it was this easy to replace the keyboard at home.</p><p>More crucially, if your laptop does get too slow for you to use, you can (with patience) swap out the mainboard, which houses the CPU (and, by extension, the integrated graphics). The idea being that in several years’ time, if your speakers, display, keyboard and everything else are working fine, why replace them. Unfortunately, buying this machine does require you to trust that the company will be around long enough to make good on that promise.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Price and the Competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd1-e940-11eb-be7c-34478b8923f6" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="8b9b39ad-f5c6-387b-ad08-404f9d76825e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework is releasing four versions of this machine, a $749 DIY edition which lets you choose a wide number of specs yourself, or provide your own. In the ready-to-use category, however, you have a $999 base model with a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. Then there’s the Performance model, which for $1,399 gets you a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Topping the chart is the $1,999 Professional edition, with a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd0-e940-11eb-b3fd-d97cb4ee49b5" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2328f502-2fcd-38df-a506-9e8f140345d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Given what Framework is offering here, it doesn’t make sense to just compare this machine to others at those $999, $1,399 and $1,999 price tiers. Instead, I checked <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/laptop-repairability">iFixit’s</a> chart of laptops which scored well on the repairability charts. One of the best performers was HP’s EliteBook 840 G7, which scored 9/10, and has a common screw format and easy to replace components. The 2021 version of that machine, the <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-840-g8-notebook-pc-p-360w8ut-aba-1">G8</a>, will set you back $1,879 for a 14-inch FHD display with a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD (or it would, but it’s out of stock).</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd4-e940-11eb-bbff-160533111ae9" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="d81d5d36-000e-39b4-8892-c935a668967b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One problem with reviewing this machine is the desire not to bang on too much about The Context. We need to be able to judge this thing on its merits and, in that regard, it’s a pretty good laptop, certainly at this price and with this performance. What will motivate you to buy one, at least right now however, is the idea that you may be able to run this thing for years. If a component breaks that isn’t on the mainboard, you should be able to find a replacement. And you should be able to swap it in without any soldering or other such expertise. Many of the other parts are standard and easily removed, so when you need more RAM, a bigger SSD or faster WiFi, that should be an easy job. And, really, that’s what you’re paying for: The hope that you can use this device without complaint not just for the next few years, <a href="https://frame.work/">but maybe the next decade</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47d17f5b-e2ac-4042-8ad0-858394371dda</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626983782</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T19:56:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Framework Laptop Hero Image]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Framework Laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus Nord 2 5G makes another good argument for ignoring expensive smartphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="b3adeb64f17d4640816a5a2b08b58e90"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsUPH6G0nho" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>OnePlus has an unusual problem. It’s making very good flagship smartphones these days — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> is an incredibly good phone — but at the same time, it’s still chasing its status as flagship phone killer.</p><p>The company’s Nord series was aimed at undercutting the expensive devices offered by the likes of Samsung, its Chinese rivals — or even Apple. Last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-nord-review-080107531.html">Nord</a> was the beginning of a new family of devices that attempted to still claim ‘flagship killer’ status, but at increasingly cheaper prices, including the debut Nord and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-143031687.html">$240 N200, which wasn’t all that great</a>. It was $240, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nord 2 5G costs more than that and is pretty similar to the original Nord in a lot of ways — including the fact that it’s not destined for the US. I’ve been testing the Nord 2 for a couple of days, and if you liked the proposition of the original Nord, you’ll probably like its sequel. The £399 (roughly $458 before tax) Nord 2 has a slightly more premium style that’s more similar to expensive relatives like the $729 OnePlus 9. While it might look the part, is it as good?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2a020-eae0-11eb-bfbf-8ae609d82c6f" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on" data-uuid="e8904c24-3a80-3e8e-ad41-12b764446b00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>I loved the vivid eye-catching sky blue of last year’s Nord, but its successor has a more restrained palette. OnePlus sent me the metallic blue option, which looks a lot like a OnePlus 9, augmented by the giant camera unit — even if it’s missing the Hasselblad label.</p><p>If you don’t like the restrained tones (there’s also a green and a gray option available depending on your region), OnePlus is also selling an aggressively wacky faux transparent case covered in white graffiti or a season-appropriate neon sunset case that’s already become my favorite.</p><p>When it comes to the cameras, there aren’t many upgrades. The rear module is now three cameras, not four, with a primary 50-megapixel (up from 48MP) sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) responsible for the heavy lifting. While a two-megapixel difference might not seem like, well, anything worth noting, the new primary sensor has a bigger pixel size (1μm), up from the 0.8μm pixels on the original Nord, but still falling short of the 1.12μm pixels of the OP9 Pro.</p><p>There’s also an 8-megapixel 119.7-degree wide-angle lens and a mono sensor for focus assistance. When it comes to zoom, the Nord 2 5G offers up to 2x optical zoom, but thanks to the size of the main sensor, it’s pretty serviceable up to 5x. According to the spec sheet, you can crank it up to 10x digital zoom, but you know you probably shouldn’t.</p><p>From my brief shooting experience — and without the original Nord to hand — there doesn’t seem to be any major performance improvements. Perhaps predictably, the low-light shooting is what benefits most from the new sensor, given those bigger pixels. Otherwise, like the Nord, the Nord 2 5G can take some very pretty photos, capturing lots of detail. The AI mode, again, is a little heavy-handed at times, so I turned it off most of the time. Occasionally the phone would struggle with wide dynamic ranges, but this was while comparing the phone to the OnePlus 9 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro — thousand-dollar smartphones.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/763e8360-eae9-11eb-9bfe-3eb123d9033e" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G camera sample" data-uuid="2638e73e-88ca-3252-9bc1-b30a6593e8d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Video-wise, the Nord 2 can handle up to 4K at 30 fps, up to 60 fps at 1080p. It uses electronic image stabilization to amp up how much wobble it can handle, and video was pleasantly smooth — if the lighting was good enough. Video in low light suffered from a weird pulsing effect, that might be due to electronic image stabilization. Sadly, the footage was barely usable.</p><p>The biggest change when it comes to imaging might be the front-facing camera. While it’s OnePlus’ highest specification front sensor, capable of taking 32-megapixel pictures, it’s just a single camera sensor, compared to the dual-array on the original Nord. OnePlus has, however, added a built-in Group Shots 2.0 feature that can detect up to five faces, imagining a world of hanging out beyond COVID-19.</p><p>OnePlus also added a dual view video mode to shoot from both the rear and front-facing cameras at once, and there’s a NightScape Ultra mode for low-light shooting too, but nothing too thrilling.</p><p>The Nord 2’s 6.47-inch AMOLED screen has a 90Hz refresh rate which feels appropriately slick, while there are color and resolution boosting AI features that can be enabled during video playback in certain apps, including YouTube, VLC, Instagram (resolution boost only) and more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6db2080-eae0-11eb-99f9-9ef9e770803e" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on" data-uuid="53847af2-a3ca-38af-8f20-afd80b12b6ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>The Nord 2 5G also marks a shift from Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm to Mediatek, with a chip apparently made especially for OnePlus. It’s called the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI, which, unsurprisingly, offers a degree of AI-centric muscle to processes like photo manipulation and the aforementioned video playback boosts. Compared to the original Nord, OnePlus claims this processor is 65% faster, while the GPU offers a 125% improvement on the original.</p><p>With limited time to test out the phone, so far, the processor feels, well, fine. I swiped and tapped through a handful of games including Alto’s Odyssey and Genshin Impact, the latter of which is a gorgeous game that can test even the most expensive flagships. It’s not the silkiest gaming experience, but Genshin Impact is an incredibly resource-intensive game that makes most phones sweat.</p><p>Performance-wise, does it beat a flagship phone, double (or triple) the price? God, no. But can it handle resource-intensive apps and tasks? Yes. I experienced some stutters on a few games that the Nord 2 shouldn’t really have struggled with, but no apps suddenly shut down. I’ve had a checkered past with phones powered by Mediatek chips, but I didn’t come across any performance issues here.</p><p>US readers might be frustrated that the Nord 2 5G won’t be coming to the US. Especially when OnePlus’ even cheaper phones  — which have hit US shores — have been too mediocre to recommend But there could be hope for future devices that land somewhere between basic smartphones eventually making it to the US</p><p>The Nord 2 is the first phone to be revealed since OnePlus announced it would be folding under Oppo in the future. For now, at least, this hasn’t resulted in any major changes for OnePlus phones. In fact, a OnePlus spokesperson told Engadget that the company was “keen to keep expanding in the US, and [the Oppo deal] gives us more resources to do it.”</p><p>The Nord 2 is a strong, if not quite perfect, mid-range phone. If OnePlus decides to make a Nord 3, perhaps it’ll nail the formula — or at least give it a chance to break America.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-2-5-g-impressions-release-date-price-144511154.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e64503a-4fdd-4714-88ff-d73656e59363</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:45:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626965480</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T14:51:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2c730-eae0-11eb-bfe3-c73cce194ce4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2c730-eae0-11eb-bfe3-c73cce194ce4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith, Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best study-from-home essentials for students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Engadget recommends a variety of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html">laptops</a> every year as part of our annual back-to-school guide. But that’s not quite enough if you want a productive study environment. Whether you’re a student staying home this year or you’re returning to campus, you’ll benefit from a few additional essentials. A laptop stand is useful for preventing neck and arm pain, while a lumbar pillow supports the lower back. A pair of noise-cancelling headphones does wonders for blocking out distractions and a LED lamp helps ease eye fatigue. From an external keyboard to a USB dock, we think all our suggestions below will lead to much-improved setup for those long study sessions.</p><h2>Soundance Laptop Stand</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3dd98f00-eaf4-11eb-a8ff-a52bfb06573b" alt="Soundance Laptop Stand

That’s why we strongly recommend getting a laptop stand. You can position your machine so that the screen is at the appropriate height. In general, you want your eye level to be one to two inches below the top of the display.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of our team’s favorites is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this one from Soundance" href="https://amzn.to/2U5uyWQ">this one from Soundance</a>, which can support laptops with 10- to 15-inch screens. It’s made from a sturdy aluminum alloy and the surface that holds the laptop is rubberized, which prevents it from sliding around. And, thanks to a series of detachable components, it’s also one of a few stands that’s easily portable. You can take it apart and put it together in minutes, making it great not just for your desk at home, but also for using it in the library.</p><p>The Soundance raises your laptop six inches above the desk, which should work well for most people. Also, the elevated design both facilitates better posture and helps ventilate your laptop. There’s even enough space underneath for you to store your keyboard and mouse when they’re not in use. If you want one with adjustable height, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rain Design iLevel 2" href="https://amzn.to/3gY4juy">Rain Design iLevel 2</a>.

You could get a chair with better back support, but those can be expensive. Plus, if you’re living in a dorm, you probably don’t have much choice in furniture anyway. The next best option is to get a lumbar support pillow. I personally recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Purple Back Cushion" href="https://amzn.to/35TPjYi">Purple Back Cushion</a> because it has a cushy grid that’s malleable enough to mold to the contour of my spine. One of the features that sets it apart from other cushions is that it has hundreds of air channels, which means you won’t get a sweaty back after sitting in a stuffy dorm room all day long. It comes with a washable cushion cover and an integrated strap that helps you attach it to most chairs.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Purple Back Cushion at Amazon - $39" href="https://amzn.to/35TPjYi">Buy Purple Back Cushion at Amazon - $39</a></p><h2>Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb5d20d0-eaf4-11eb-9ed5-d267e8071c8f" alt="Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38" data-uuid="7065cf1e-0592-3bdc-98db-374f867e3a3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / Taotronics</div></figure><p>Another desk must-have is a lamp for those late-night study sessions. And if you’re going to spend money on one, it’s a good idea to get a lamp that can charge your devices at the same time.

Additionally, it has a USB port for charging other devices that aren’t Qi compatible. A multipurpose lamp is perfect for students who have a limited space and budget, plus the quick-charging base means you can quickly top up your battery in between classes. Of course, not having to deal with a charging cable while you’re studying is also a bonus.</p><p>The LED Desk Lamp 38 is also just a really excellent lamp, with five lighting modes and five brightness levels. You can use it on your nightstand too: It has a “night light” and a timer mode that automatically shuts off after an hour, which is helpful for those of us who like to read before bed.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Desk Lamp 38 at Taotronics - $56" href="https://fave.co/3dhYCp1">Buy Desk Lamp 38 at Taotronics - $56</a></p><h2>Sony WH-CH710N noise cancelling headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ec6b0ad0-eaf4-11eb-9dff-d3634feae27f" alt="Sony WH-CH710N Noise Cancelling Headphones" data-uuid="8f3e7bb7-575d-3e74-92ee-7e0acbcc50be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>A pair of noise-cancelling headphones is great for blocking out unwanted noise during study sessions, be it from annoying siblings or a raucous roommate.

The VA2456-MHD has HDMI, DisplayPort and VGA connections, which makes it pretty versatile for a budget monitor. It also has 1080p resolution and an IPS panel for wide-angle viewing. Its three-sided frameless design is sleek too, an important quality for such a relatively large object.

That means you can use it for water as well as coffee or tea when you need a pick-me-up. It comes in a variety of colors, and it ships with two stainless straws, two plastic straws and straw cleaning brushes — so not only is the cup itself easy to clean, but you’re getting the tools to clean the straws, too.

A new analysis of the security expenses racked up by Silicon Valley giants shows they collectively spent $46 million to safeguard their top brass last year. Of that figure, $23.4 million alone was spent on Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s personal security, up from $20.4 million in 2019, according to the report by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/ceo-security-pandemic"><em>Protocol</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company attributed the increase to new COVID-19 protocols and additional protection during the election. Included in the figure was a pre-tax allowance of $10 million and an additional $13.4 million for the Facebook founder&#39;s personal security. As a result, Zuckerberg far eclipsed others on the list including the world&#39;s richest person, Jeff Bezos, who paid $1.6 million in personal security costs. Signalling just how cautious Facebook is, the company&#39;s COO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/SherylSandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> was in second place with security worth $7.6 million in 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The results reflect the growing stature of the tech elite, who have grown more recognizable alongside the ballooning market caps of their companies, which provide globally popular services.

The company has previously noted in SEC filings that Zuckerberg is &quot;synonymous&quot; with the &quot;negative sentiment&quot; around it. In April, Facebook noted that its yearly assessments “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg.&quot; Other tech leaders have also borne the brunt of their notoriety. In 2020, it was revealed that Bezos&#39; phone had been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-guardian-jeff-bezos-whatsapp-hack-saudi-arabia-mbs.html">hacked</a> via WhatsApp two years prior, potentially by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>The security expenses list includes 11 individuals in total. In third place is Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai ($5.4 million in protection costs), followed by Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer ($2.06 million), Oracle&#39;s Larry Ellison ($1.71 million), Snap&#39;s Evan Spiegel ($1.67 million), Bezos, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff ($1.31 million), Uber&#39;s Dara Khosrowshahi ($849,000), Lyft CEO Logan Green ($599,000) and Apple&#39;s Tim Cook ($470,000).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-mark-zuckerberg-130242571.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1201b9f0-98b1-44f6-bab0-6c6c3d94368e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 13:02:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626958964</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:02:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eduardo Munoz / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Inc.

While we saw this model drop to $79 during Black Friday last year, this discount is the best we&#39;ve seen offered by Amazon all year.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Instant Pot Duo Crisp at Amazon - $98" href="https://amzn.to/3zphJGd">Buy Instant Pot Duo Crisp at Amazon - $98</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike standard Instant Pots, this model comes with both the easy-seal lid and a detachable air-frying lid, the latter of which can be used to make crispy chicken wings, vegetables, fries and more. The pot itself has 11 built-in cooking programs, including sauté, pressure cook, steam, bake, broil and dehydrate. The bundle includes most things you&#39;ll need to try out all of those cooking modes, too, like a broil and dehydrate tray, multi-level air fry rack and more. Only the six-quart model is on sale (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:eight-quart" href="https://amzn.to/3BxqkbA">eight-quart</a> will set you back $200), but it&#39;s arguably the best size for most people as it can hold enough food for up to eight people.</p><p>The Duo Crisp is, admittedly, a more &quot;advanced&quot; Instant Pot than most. If you&#39;re new to the multi-cooker space, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$69 Instant Pot Duo" href="https://amzn.to/2V785sP">$69 Instant Pot Duo</a> as it starts off cheaper than the Duo Crisp and it keeps things fairly simple with seven cooking modes. But for those who know a multi-cooker would make their meal prep much easier, and for whom air-fry experimentation sounds exciting, the Duo Crisp is a good investment.

But some toys are better than others when it comes to actually stimulating your child’s brain while also keeping them entertained. The parents on the Engadget staff know this well, and we’ve tried out a bunch of educational toys with our kids, with various results. These are some of the ones that have had staying power with our children — and even we adults have to admit we found them pretty fun, too.</p><h2>Smart Lab: Smart Circuits</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818b8ff1-df5a-11eb-bf97-0f6cdaf2522c" alt="Smart Lab: Smart Circuits for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="0668a510-c1f6-3d4a-8427-d648a10064a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to introducing kids to electronics there are a ton of options, but I personally like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Smart Circuits kit" href="https://amzn.to/3jhXCVH">Smart Circuits kit</a>. It can take a kid from simple blinking lights to complex motion-controlled games. The snap-together baseboard can lie flat on a table like a regular breadboard, but it can also be folded into a cube or the pieces can be attached at a 90-degree angle. This gives kids an extra element to play with when they graduate to designing their own circuits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The kit itself only has a few pieces, but they’re quite flexible. And they’re all housed in large colorful plastic that should be easy for a kid to handle. There’s the usual electronics kid fare, like LEDs, a speaker, a potentiometer and two buttons. But there’s also a tilt switch, a light sensor and a microprocessor capable of handling some relatively robust tasks. The kit comes with instructions for 50 projects, but with the parts available a creative child could build quite a few more.</p><p>My one critique is that the jumper wires can be tough to insert and might require a bit of patience — something we know not every eight-year-old has an abundance of.<em>&nbsp;</em>—<em> Terrence O’Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50" href="https://amzn.to/3jhXCVH">Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50</a></p><h2>Playskool Shape Sorter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818b8ff0-df5a-11eb-9dbf-4a1e53e822fe" alt="Playskool Shape Sorter for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="194a562b-b7df-3fda-90b6-b61a11a059a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playskool </div></figure><p>A shape sorter is an awesome toy for younger kids because it encourages hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, problem-solving and even vocabulary (by identifying the names of shapes and colors).

The lid latches, which means they can’t just dump the shapes out easily; they have to learn how to work the mechanics of the lid as well. Also, the multi-colored shapes have tactile patterns on them that match the area of the box they’re supposed to fit into, and that gives me another teaching opportunity. The whole thing is durable, too — my son likes to chew on the shapes and my daughter likes to stand on the box, but despite that abuse, there’s not so much as a dent or a scratch on it. And because it’s only $9, it makes a great gift if you’re buying for someone else’s kiddo. —<em> Amber Bouman, Associate Editor, Parenting</em></p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Shape Sorter at Amazon - $10" href="https://amzn.to/3zSe2dh">Buy Shape Sorter at Amazon - $10</a></p><h2>Yoto Player</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818d8bc1-df5a-11eb-8edf-d3af5be54aaa" alt="Yoto Player for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="37456e4f-e217-37bd-b034-bcdf329d0d74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Yoto Player" href="https://amzn.to/3hNfCES">Yoto Player</a> is the perfect toy for a young child who wants to play their own tunes and stories, but who isn’t ready for an iPad or smart speaker of their own. Yoto’s cute design and blocky, pixel-like display looks distinctly retro. It’s detailed enough for kids to make out images, but it’s insufficient for video, which should actually be good news for parents worried about too much screen time.

Each month my three-year-old gets a collection of simple DIY toys, crafts and games built around a theme. For instance, a recent box was all about bioluminescent animals. Inside was a plush lightning bug that we had to stuff ourselves and shape using hair ties; a mushroom that had us painting a Slurpee lid and then dotting it with glow-in-the-dark stickers; and a dancing, glowing jellyfish as well as several window clings of sea creates for him to create scenes with.</p><p>Past kits have covered farm life, dinosaurs and simple machines like ramps. The stuff inside the box is usually pretty simple (think: cardboard, felt and wood). It’s definitely not built to last, but my kid has gotten plenty of use out of each piece.</p><p>The best part is the crates will grow with him.

Both my son and daughter (we bought one for each) love racing through the hallway with their pull-along trains. And, now that my daughter is in school, the train’s number blocks come in handy to help with the basics of her maths homework.

It intrigues children by activating their senses and helps them develop their fine-motor skills and problem solving by using real-world obstacles.
