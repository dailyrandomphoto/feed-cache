Google has <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices">released</a> the fifth and final beta for Pixel phones (including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel 5a</a>) and several third-party devices, giving you one more look before the finished version arrives. Beta 5 is a release candidate build with the usual last-minute fixes and performance improvements, so don&#39;t expect major changes from beta 4 or even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-3-update-available-today-scrolling-screenshot-170040876.html">beta 3</a>.</p><p>The completed software is due sometime in the &quot;weeks ahead,&quot; Google said. If history is any indication, only Pixel owners will get Android 12 first — you&#39;ll have to wait for third parties to customize and deploy their releases in the months to come.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Material You design scheme remains the most conspicuous change in Android 12, including an overall interface refresh, more fluid animations as well as color themes that adapt to your wallpaper. You&#39;ll also see more privacy features, including a dedicated Privacy Dashboard as well as toggles and in-use indicators for cameras and microphones.</p><p>There are subtler under-the-hood improvements, too, such as camera-based auto-rotation and an on-device search engine that helps find content within your apps. This isn&#39;t a gigantic leap in some respects, but it could help revitalize Android if you&#39;ve felt that previous releases were a little stale.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-5-final-170051810.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d668300-6622-4474-ab35-83b8db828e8b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631115888</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:44:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cdde24b0-10b7-11ec-8a9c-9dfd2c42ac68" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cdde24b0-10b7-11ec-8a9c-9dfd2c42ac68" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12 beta with Material You design]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12 beta with Material You design]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter starts rolling out Communities, it's dedicated space for groups]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 15 years, Twitter is getting dedicated features for groups. The company is now starting to test Communities, “a more intimate space for conversations” on the platform.</p><p>Communities, which the company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-test-communities-tipping-super-follows-183101868.html"><ins>teased</ins></a> back in February, are sort of like Twitter’s version of a subreddit or a public-facing group on Facebook. Communities are dedicated to specific topics, and members can post tweets to a dedicated group timeline. Each community has its own moderators who set rules for the group, and users must be invited by an existing member or moderator to participate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature is meant to address what’s been a long-running issue for the platform: that it can be incredibly difficult for new users to wade through the noise and find the corner of Twitter that speaks to their interests. The company has tried to address this with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-twitter-topics-live.html"><ins>Topics</ins></a>, which injects tweets into your timeline based on your interests, but Communities takes the idea a step further.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/313b9be0-10c3-11ec-9edf-1b6598f373da" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Communities are for more " data-uuid="c78014fd-c07e-3b9b-9d25-b64dfa907a54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Twitter notes that some of its first Communities will focus on popular topics like skincare, astrology, sneakers and dogs, but that over time it expects the groups to reflect the more “niche discussions” that happen on the platform. For now, Twitter is starting with just a handful of Communities, though moderators and members are able to invite anyone to join. The company says it plans to open up the feature for more users to create Communities in the “coming months.”</p><p>Notably, Twitter seems to be trying to avoid some of the issues that have plagued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html"><ins>Facebook’s Groups</ins></a>. All Communities are publicly accessible and viewable by anyone on the platform —there’s no such thing as a private or “secret” Community — though only members can participate in the discussion directly. Like Reddit and Facebook, Twitter will also rely on admins and moderators to steer the day-to-day conversations and keep members in check. The company is also working on new reporting and detection features to weed out “potentially problematic” groups that may spring up.</p><p>Though the company is calling the feature a test, Twitter seems to be quite serious about its potential. Communities is getting its own tab in the center of Twitter’s app, between explore and notifications, which suggests the company plans for Communities to be a prominent feature of its platform for the long term.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-communities-170039437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">720f6ee3-4170-41e0-b6eb-ca1fda5a5f79</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631119497</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T16:45:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is testing communities, its new subreddit like feature for groups.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter communities]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fake pro-China accounts tried to push Americans to attend anti-racism protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, security researchers from Google and cybersecurity firm Mandiant disclosed that a network of fake pro-China social media accounts tried to mobilize Americans to attend anti-racism protests in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/09/pro-prc-influence-campaign-social-media-websites-forums.html"><ins>report the two organizations published</ins></a>, the network “did not appear to achieve any success,” but in one instance it tried to push Asian-Americans to attend an April 24th protest that sought to “fight back” against claims the virus was engineered in a Chinese lab.</p><p>They did not directly attribute the campaign to the Chinese government. However, John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant, told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-china-online-network-used-fake-accounts-to-urge-asian-americans-to-attend-protests-researchers-say-11631109601"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>the operation was “almost certainly supported by a government sponsor, either directly through a government agency or a third-party contractor.” Additionally, the scale of the campaign suggests the network had significant resources at its disposal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers say the campaign may suggest an intention to motivate real-world action outside of the borders of China. At the very least, the scope of the activity is far broader than previous efforts this network has conducted. In 2019, it was linked to efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-youtube-hong-kong.html">discredit the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong</a>.</p><p>This time around, they did not limit their efforts merely to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Instead, they cast a wide net, creating accounts across more than 30 social media platforms and 40 additional websites and “niche” forums, including places like LiveJournal and Vimeo. They also tried to reach a global audience by posting in Russian, German, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, in addition to Chinese and English.</p><p>&quot;Over the past two years, we have seen this threat actor evolve, from the types of content they publish to the tactics they use to amplify it. However, the most significant features of this network remain its scale and persistence, in spite of low engagement levels,” Shane Huntley, the director of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, told Engadget. “... We anticipate they will continue to experiment to drive higher engagement and encourage others in the community to continue tracking this actor, shedding light on their operations and taking action against them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pro-china-fake-network-anti-asian-american-hate-protests-164004929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61caf576-a6c0-4f38-8a2d-f612f2403ee6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:40:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631119216</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T16:40:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bdf94b0-10c1-11ec-bc54-61260e4ef907" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bdf94b0-10c1-11ec-bc54-61260e4ef907" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARLIAMENT SQUARE, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/07/24: A demonstrator wearing Chinese traditional jacket holds a placard  outside Parliament Square during the Stop Asian Hate rally in London.

Hulst noted that &quot;quite a few members of Firesprite,&quot; including all of the founding team, came from Wipeout developer Studio Liverpool.

Firssprite teamed up with Team Asobi on <em>The Playroom</em>, a 2013 collection of augmented reality minigames designed to show off the PlayStation Camera&#39;s capabilities. Its most recent game is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-13-the-persistence.html"><em><ins>The Persistence</ins></em></a>, a survival horror title that hit consoles and PC last year after debuting on PlayStation VR.</p><p>The Firesprite team is working on <em>something</em> new, but it&#39;s not entirely clear what.

However, items that promote misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines are still appearing in search results on the Amazon storefront, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>The senator&#39;s staff found that searches for terms including “COVID-19,” “COVID,” “vaccine,” “COVID-19 vaccine” and “pandemic” led to results such as books peddling &quot;falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines and cures,&quot; including at least one that Amazon tagged as a best seller. Engadget was able to replicate some of the search results Warren flagged.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.9.7%20Letter%20to%20Amazon%20on%20COVID%20Misinformation.pdf">a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/elizabeth-warren-asks-amazon-ceo-to-crack-down-on-covid-misinformation.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>, Warren urged the company to review Amazon&#39;s algorithms. She called on Jassy to, within 14 days, detail a plan to modify the algorithms so they no longer turn up products that include COVID-19 misinformation, and to release a public report on &quot;the extent to which Amazon’s algorithms are directing consumers&quot; to such items at the moment.</p><p>In addition, Warren sought clarification on Amazon&#39;s current policies about those products and what the company has done to tackle the spread of false information. She also wants to know more details about the best-seller tag, and why books containing COVID-19 misinformation are being awarded the label.</p><p>Warren acknowledged that Amazon has provided its users with resources for accurate information about COVID-19, including prominent links to the Food and Drug Administration website. Her staff see any instances of Amazon displaying sponsored search results for pandemic-related terms either.

The agency now <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-readies-james-webb-space-telescope-for-december-launch">plans to launch</a> the telescope on December 18th, 2021, just a few months after testing completed in late August. The hardware will reach orbit aboard an ESA-supplied Ariane 5 rocket lifting off from French Guiana. NASA still has to ship the telescope to the launchpad, although much of the rocket has already arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>The JWST was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">deemed complete</a> in 2016 ahead of an expected 2018 launch, but faced a number of delays due to its elaborate construction. It wasn&#39;t assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">until 2019</a>, and factors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coronavirus-delays-launch-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-161528305.html">like the COVID-19 pandemic</a> further hindered NASA&#39;s efforts. That&#39;s not including earlier setbacks — development started in 1996 with an expected 2007 deployment, but the team scrapped much of its work and redesigned the equipment in 2005.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The telescope&#39;s importance hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s considered the successor to the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html"> Hubble Space Telescope</a>. It includes a much larger mirror along with a focus on lower-frequency observations (particularly mid-infrared) that will help it detect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-07-sounds-of-oldest-stars-in-milky-way-galaxy.html">early galaxies</a> that even Hubble can&#39;t find. That priority also helps explain some of its technical challenges. The JWST&#39;s instruments will need to stay extremely cold (-370F) to avoid interference with infrared measurements, requiring both a large sunshield and an insertion near a Sun-Earth Lagrange point.</p><p>The mission will be relatively short. As the JWST needs propellant to maintain orbit, it can&#39;t last indefinitely like a telescope circling Earth. NASA would consider a five-year lifespan &quot;nominal,&quot; although it&#39;s hoping for 10 years.</p><p>All the effort might just pay off. In addition to shedding more light on the early Universe, the JWST should also help astronomers and astrophysicists fill gaps in studies where Hubble wasn&#39;t enough. Infrared waves are more likely to cut through cosmic dust, and they&#39;re the primary radiation from cooler celestial bodies like brown dwarfs and planets. There&#39;s a very real chance the JWST will help solve a string of cosmic mysteries during its brief lifetime.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f8502fd-99d2-4800-b26d-9b97534e2e63</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 14:51:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631114021</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:13:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alex-mit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's first non-Quibi movie is a Christmas special]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roku is finally expanding its original content beyond a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-adds-more-quibi-shows-to-original-144530038.html">parade of Quibi shows</a>.

As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661348/gmail-ring-meet-communication-suite-series-one-monitor-workspace">noted</a>, Google is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/enabling-hybrid-work-with-google-workspace">rolling out</a> a larger Workspace update (more on that shortly) that will add direct calling via Google Meet to the Gmail mobile app. You&#39;ll get to ring up your coworkers and other contacts for a quick one-on-one when email or a scheduled meeting won&#39;t do. The feature will also send a &quot;chip&quot; to your computer if you&#39;d rather answer on the larger screen.</p><p>The company has pitched the feature as a rough equivalent to &quot;spontaneous&quot; office chats in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-sundar-pichai-hybrid-work-week-plan-225637951.html">hybrid work environment</a> where some staff are at home.

You&#39;ll now see Google&#39;s promised &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-open-everyone-free-spaces-100004157.html">spaces</a>,&quot; a renamed and expanded version of Rooms chat channels with full threaded messages and the option of making spaces visible in search. You can accordingly expect easier navigation between email, chats, spaces and Meet, not to mention improved admin and security tools to help manage communications. Enterprise users should see these changes starting today, but everyday Gmail owners will see updates later on.</p><p>Other tweaks include options to specify whether you&#39;re in-office or virtual on a given day (important for planning meetings) and a Companion mode for Meet that lets you use a conference room&#39;s audiovisual hardware. Google is expanding its Meet hardware ecosystem, too. There are two new Series One devices (third-party equipment made to fit Google&#39;s goals), including the Series One Desk 27 all-in-one and Series One Board 65 4K collaborative board. More gadgets are Meet-certified, too, such as Logitech&#39;s Rally Bar and Rally Bar Mini room solutions as well as the Rayz Rally Pro speaker dock.</p><div id="318314c2509d4985ba4a26c4399289c0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR81EAce5BQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Google&#39;s ambitions for Gmail are fairly clear.

That&#39;s not surprising when Google is directly competing with Office. At the same time, it does raise questions about support for dedicated apps. What need is there for other clients when Gmail theoretically does it all? Still, you might not mind if it saves you from switching apps and potentially losing focus.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gmail-voice-calls-google-meet-133033634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28428001-53df-455d-98a4-d5ef09fa6499</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 13:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631107836</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T13:30:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-02/a63c6880-2704-11e9-aefe-56e5b64e7469" width="3969" height="2636" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/a63c6880-2704-11e9-aefe-56e5b64e7469" width="3969" height="2636" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Google Gmail mailing app is seen on an Android portable device on February 5, 2018.

But as <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/6_classic_star_trek_games_ready_to_beam_up_new_players_and_fans_alike">GOG writes</a>, &quot;an absolute golden era of Star Trek games began at the end of the ’90s and the beginning of the 2000s with new games landing every few months.&quot;</p><p>Particularly, <em>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</em> and <em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander</em> are considered to be some of the best <em>Star Trek</em> titles out there, as <a href="https://screenrant.com/best-star-trek-video-games-ranked/"><em>Screen Rant</em></a> notes. Many of those titles have become unavailable and are unplayable on modern machines, as well. &quot;This changes now with [these games] releasing for the first time in digital distribution,&quot; GOG said. All the games are <a href="https://adtr.co/AnXANB">now available</a> in the US (and elsewhere) for $10.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gog-now-lets-you-play-six-classic-star-trek-games-125037822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2e14c92-fdef-44d2-be48-8b462ffa83f5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 12:50:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631105679</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T12:54:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0d8a65d0-1098-11ec-afb4-3be5304415a9" width="1228" height="756" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0d8a65d0-1098-11ec-afb4-3be5304415a9" width="1228" height="756" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gigan85]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GOG's store adds six classic 'Star Trek' games]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GOG's store adds six classic 'Star Trek' games]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify opens up Release Radar for brand sponsorships, starting with Disney+]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-05-spotifys-release-radar-playlist-new-music.html">Release Radar</a> is one of the most popular algorithmically generated playlists on Spotify, and for good reason. The mix is updated weekly with a collection of new material from the artists you listen to often. The playlist has been keeping users in the loop for five years at this point, and now the streaming service is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-09-08/spotifys-release-radar-personalized-playlist-celebrates-five-years-and-16-billion-streams/">opening it up to advertisers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is actually the third playlist Spotify has offered up for ads, joining <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-spotify-discover-weekly-brand-sponsorship.html">Discover Weekly</a> and On Repeat as potential sponsorship opportunities for brands. With Release Radar, Disney+ will be the first to jump on board in the US, promoting its Billie Eilish film <em>Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter To Los Angeles</em>. Spotify says free users will see ads in the form of audio, video and graphics and direct them to the playlist. Once inside, logos will appear on the playlist art along with messages from the sponsor at each ad break (audio and video). Along with music-focused advertisements, you&#39;ll likely see sponsorships from gaming, automotive, fashion and tech brands as well as phone service providers. However, Spotify explains the opportunity is open to all companies, not just those that fit in the aforementioned categories. As always, Premium users won&#39;t see, or hear, any of the sponsored content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Release Radar has a captive audience. The playlist has been streamed over 16 billion times globally since its launch in 2016. It&#39;s a a top-three personalized playlist for Spotify users in several regions, including North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Most listeners are 18-29 year olds, and Spotify says that group accounts for over 50 percent of Release Radar streaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Free users in the US should be seeing the Disney+ sponsorship on Release Radar soon, if you haven&#39;t already. If you stream on the ad-supported tier outside of the States, sponsored messages will appear for you as well: the playlist is available for brands to advertise in 31 markets around the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-release-radar-ads-120051401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7bd2c30e-4a34-4cce-aef6-c1a44ed46cee</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 12:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631044513</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T19:55:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/082f24f0-0fd9-11ec-af7e-61a9ea3dedfd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/082f24f0-0fd9-11ec-af7e-61a9ea3dedfd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify Release Radar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify Release Radar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat makes it easier to track and celebrate friends' birthdays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap is introducing a fun new way for Snapchat users to track and celebrate the birthdays of their friends. The company’s new Birthday Mini gives you one place to see a list of all the upcoming birthdays of people you follow on the app. You can either see them organized by how soon they’re coming up or by zodiac signs. The tool comes courtesy of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-mini-apps-174530579.html">Minis</a> functionality Snap introduced last summer. And as with all other Minis, you can find this one by tapping the rocket icon in Snapchat or by searching for it individually.</p><p>For privacy reasons, the Mini won’t display the birth year of your friend nor their exact age. Similarly, other Snapchat users won’t see that same information about you. You also won’t see the birthdays of friends who haven’t consented to display them in the app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Birthday Mini is the first one to include lens sharing, a feature that allows you to unlock special themed lenses you can send as snaps to your friends or include in your stories. When someone sees them in those contexts, they can swipe up to join the Mini. It’s a small feature addition, to be sure, but one that makes keeping track of everyone’s special day easier. Previously, Snap would indicate your friend was celebrating their birthday through an emoji in your friends feed.  You can access the Birthday Mini starting today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-birthday-mini-120015292.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd1ce68a-2f67-47f4-81cf-2d6d70be39ae</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 12:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631097541</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T10:39:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/efa461a0-1048-11ec-b5b7-a24d8495cbfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/efa461a0-1048-11ec-b5b7-a24d8495cbfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat Birthday Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Snapchat Birthday Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Apple’s next iPhone event is next week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought BMW’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-recyclable-i-vision-cirulcar-concept-has-a-very-weird-crystal-interface-085205690.html">bizarre crystal sculpture car dash</a> was going to be the weirdest vehicle of the week, but Hyundai thought otherwise.

The vulnerability known as CVE-2021-40444 affects Windows Servers from version 2008 and Windows 7 through 10.

Further, it advises disabling all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to render it inactive for all websites.

The service, which lets you pick up goods from shelves and (yep) just walk out, is coming to new stores in Washington DC and Sherman Oaks, California next year, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/whole-foods-market-to-launch-just-walk-out-technology-at-two-locations">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;By collaborating with Amazon to introduce Just Walk Out shopping at these two Whole Foods Market stores, our customers will be able to... save time by skipping the checkout line,&quot; said Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we&#39;ve detailed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-amazon-go-grocery-store.html">previously</a>, Just Walk Out uses computer vision, sensors and AI to let you walk into a store, sign in with an app, fill up your bags and leave without the need to join a checkout line. On top of using the tech in its own Go and Fresh stores, Amazon signed a deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-amazon-checkout-free-technology-business-just-walk-out.html">last year</a> to license its technology to third-party retailers.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology will work the same at Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon. Shoppers can opt to use the tech when they enter the store by scanning an app, inserting a debit card linked to their Amazon account, or by placing their palm over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-adds-its-contactless-palmreading-one-tech-to-more-go-stores-103800363.html">Amazon One</a> palm-scanning system.&nbsp;</p><p>Unions have <a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-amazon-grocery-expansion-with-cashierless-technology-threatens-good-paying-jobs-of-essential-workers/">proclaimed</a> that Amazon&#39;s cashierless tech will cost workers jobs, but Amazon said the new Whole Foods locations will &quot;employ a comparable number of team members as existing Whole Foods stores of similar sizes.&quot; Rather, employees will be able to &quot;spend even more time interacting with customers and delivering a great shopping experience,&quot; Amazon said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fbd5b17a-6b39-47e8-8160-b67b2a9619eb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 10:10:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631104783</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T12:39:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/002ce600-1085-11ec-bbea-ce112211791d" width="1320" height="743" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/002ce600-1085-11ec-bbea-ce112211791d" width="1320" height="743" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's 'Just Walk Out' cashierless tech comes to two Whole Foods stores]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's 'Just Walk Out' cashierless tech comes to two Whole Foods stores]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG claims its new 'Real Folding Window' display material is as hard as glass]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Z Flip 3</a> devices did very well in their home country, and market research groups like <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/foldable-smartphone-shipments-2023/">Counterpoint</a> believe foldable shipments are bound to grow in the coming years. Foldable devices might soon no longer be niche products, and LG has developed a new material that could help make that a reality. LG Chem has <a href="https://www.lgchem.com/company/information-center/press-release/news-detail-8713?lang=en_GLOBAL">designed</a> a new type of cover window — that is, the outermost pre-installed part of displays protecting them from impact — that it says is as hard as glass while also having the capability to prevent fold impressions on the connecting part of a device.&nbsp;</p><p>The company calls the material &quot;Real Folding Window,&quot; and it&#39;s made of PET film coated on both sides with a new coating technology it developed. A spokesperson explained: &quot;Unlike existing polyimide films and tempered glass-type materials, the cover window that applied LG Chem&#39;s new coating technologies will maximize flexibility, while also providing optimized solutions for foldable phones such as making improvements to chronic issues like fold impressions on the connecting part of the screen.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the Real Folding Window can be folded both outwards and inwards unlike current counterparts that are optimized to be bent one way. LG Chem says it&#39;s thinner than tempered glass, is priced competitively and has been tested to be able to endure being folded over 200,000 times.&nbsp;</p><p>While the coating on both sides is only a few micrometers thick, the company is developing another type of Real Folding Window that doesn&#39;t use PET film. The idea is to create a very thin cover window for use in devices like foldable phones and rollable displays. LG Chem is planning to start mass producing the Real Folding Window in 2022 and to start selling them the year after that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-real-folding-window-foldable-display-material-093502085.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9404c108-31ac-4bc5-b8bf-1aa6f9a7566c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 09:35:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631104867</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T12:41:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fc656240-107a-11ec-97fb-00baa49f010f" width="850" height="546" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fc656240-107a-11ec-97fb-00baa49f010f" width="850" height="546" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG Real Folding Window]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG Real Folding Window]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max arrives in Europe on October 26th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-app-vizio-smartcast-tv-191121848.html">HBO Max</a> is heading to Europe.

In the US, there&#39;s also an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-launch-window-155756778.html">ad-supported</a> tier that costs $10 a month instead of $15.

WarnerMedia will reveal more details, including the service&#39;s prices and content offering in Europe, at a virtual launch event in October.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-europe-october-26th-090033191.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eef6ba40-c496-4ac2-9815-67912559fc75</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 09:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631086775</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T07:39:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/64150ca0-1072-11ec-9f1f-2218885d87ea" width="1584" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/64150ca0-1072-11ec-9f1f-2218885d87ea" width="1584" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HBO Max]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PayPal acquires buy now, pay later provider Paidy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PayPal is continuing its push into buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services with the acquisition of Japanese company Paidy for 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/paypal-to-acquire-japanese-unicorn-paidy-in-2-7-billion-deal"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported. That represents its second largest acquisition to date after the $4 billion dollar purchase of online coupon aggregator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-paypal-buys-money-saving-service-honey.html">Honey</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>BNPL services let users divide purchases into multiple payments without paying any interest. Instead, PayPal and other providers make money by charging fees to merchants when a consumer buys a product, much as credit card providers do.

The tech giant has purchased a startup called Clipchamp, which is known for its in-browser video creation and editing tool. In its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/09/07/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-to-empower-creators/">announcement</a>, Microsoft says Clipchamp&#39;s approach combines &quot;the simplicity of a web app with the ability to process video using the full computing power of a PC with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,&quot; which is &quot;something that was formerly limited to traditional video applications.&quot;</p><p>Clipchamp specifically targets non-professionals and non-creatives — people who don&#39;t have or know how to use specialized software for videos, in other words. &quot;Our mission is to empower anyone to tell stories worth sharing and millions of people around the world... We will continue to make video creation even easier, more accessible and fun,&quot; company CEO Alexander Dreiling wrote in a <a href="https://clipchamp.com/en/blog/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-to-empower-creators/">post</a> announcing the acquisition.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neither party has disclosed the terms of their agreement, but as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/07/microsoft-acquires-video-editing-software-start-up-clipchamp.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes, Clipchamp said in July that it has 17 million registered users with an adoption rate that&#39;s up 54 percent year over year. The service saw huge growth in 9:16 aspect ratio exports, in particular, which are commonly used for TikTok and Instagram or Facebook Stories. Microsoft was one of its clients before the acquisition, along with Google. While Microsoft has yet to announce how it will offer Clipchamp to its customers, it called the tool a &quot;natural fit&quot; for its cloud-powered productivity experiences in Microsoft 365. A spokesperson also told <em>CNBC</em> that the tech giant will eventually introduce a process to convert existing Clipchamp users to Microsoft subscribers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-040823250.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eab47aee-5e27-47bc-beae-06fd4a1bf6f2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 04:08:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631074148</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T04:09:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d27a0780-1055-11ec-b853-4863939064a7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d27a0780-1055-11ec-b853-4863939064a7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clipchamp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Clipchamp]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Clipchamp]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The latest animated Pokémon movie is coming to Netflix on October 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After making its debut in Japan last year, the Pokémon franchise’s 23rd animated movie is <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/newest-animated-pokemon-movie-pokemon-the-movie-secrets-of-the-jungle-to"><ins>making its way to Netflix</ins></a>.

On Tuesday, Ford <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/07/doug-field.html"><ins>announced the hire of Doug Field</ins></a>. The former Tesla executive, known for his involvement in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-02-tesla-engineering-lead-doug-field-leaves-the-company.html"><ins>development of the Model 3</ins></a>, most recently held the position of vice president of special projects at Apple. It’s believed Field oversaw Project Titan.</p><p>In his new position of chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer, Field will report to Ford CEO and president Jim Farley. He will oversee Ford’s Embedded Software and Hardware division, which will see him lead development on the automaker’s Blue Oval intelligence stack. It’s expected he will have a say in everything from vehicle controls to enterprise connectivity features and driver assistance technology. For Field, this is something of a return to where everything started.

Further out now, if ever.” Apple does have executives who could take over Field’s role.

Continental thinks it might help. <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/continental-greenconcept-future-tire-dandelions-rice-retreads/">reports</a> the company has <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/press/press-releases/20210906-tires-greenconcept/">introduced</a> the Conti GreenConcept (yes, a concept tire) where more than half of the materials are &quot;traceable, renewable and recycled.&quot; You can even renew the natural rubber tread with little trouble — not a completely new idea, but refreshable treads have generally been reserved for large commercial trucks. Three renewals would be enough to ensure the material used for casing is cut in half relative to the total mileage.</p><p>About 35 percent of the materials are renewables, including dandelion rubber, silicate made from rice husk ash and a string of vegetable oils and resins. Another 17 percent is polyester yarn made from recycled PET bottles, reclaimed steel and recovered carbon black.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The design should improve the efficiency of the cars themselves, Continental added. New casing, sidewall and tread patterns make the GreenConcept about 40 percent lighter than a conventional tire at about 16.5lbs, That, in turn, leads to 25 percent lower rolling resistance than the highest-rated tires in the EU. Continental estimates you&#39;d get six percent more range from an electric vehicle.</p><p>While you might not outfit your car with these exact tires any time soon, this is more than just a thought exercise. Continental plans to gradually deploy its recycling technology starting in 2022, including the production of tires using recycled bottles.&nbsp;</p><p>Efforts like the Conti GreenConcept are partly meant to burnish Continental&#39;s public image. It wants to be the most environmentally responsible tire company by 2030, and become completely carbon-neutral by 2050 &quot;at the latest.&quot; However, it also hints at a more holistic approach to eco-friendly cars where many components, not just the powertrain, are kinder to the planet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/continental-conti-greenconcept-renewable-tread-tire-201058901.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d6654ebd-7ddb-4a27-acdd-dac05121cbc5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 20:10:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631044927</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T20:02:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conservation & Recycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4c3278a0-1010-11ec-abfe-fa2cae99edb7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4c3278a0-1010-11ec-abfe-fa2cae99edb7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Continental]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Continental Conti GreenConcept tire with renewable tread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Continental Conti GreenConcept tire with renewable tread]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
