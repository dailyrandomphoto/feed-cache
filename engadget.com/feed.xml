At launch, the next-gen console offered only 667GB of space for storing your PS5 games, with no way to expand that. While that’s been fine for some (like me), others (like my son) have been performing a near-daily juggling act, having to frequently delete and re-download games due to the restrictive storage size and the apparent need to have constant access to every Call of Duty game.</p><p>With the upcoming system software update — currently in beta testing — you’ll be able to increase your storage by slotting in a standard PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD. If that mess of acronyms has you recoiling, don’t worry, you’ll see that it’s not all that complicated, and if you want to know which drives we recommend, you can skip to the end.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>How much storage do I need?</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/341eb080-1ec1-11eb-bffb-88f330aaaf35" alt="Sony PlayStation 5 gaming console." data-uuid="7ad959d1-4d5d-3176-b02c-ebf74f05f30c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris / Engadget</div></figure><p>The PS5 will accept drives between 250GB and 4TB in capacity. If you already have a PlayStation 5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you want. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5, or buying for someone else, though, it’s difficult to tell.</p><p>PS5 games are a little smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically ranging between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, just having <em>Cold War</em> multiplayer and <em>Modern Warfare</em>/<em>Warzone</em> installed will require 307GB of space. A full <em>Warzone</em>-<em>Modern Warfare</em>-<em>Cold War</em> install will take up almost two thirds of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on your PS5 internally before running into problems.</p><p>One additional thing to consider is your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work out. A 100GB download takes me around eight hours, during which time it&#39;s difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point make sense, at least for my household.</p><p>Off the bat, there&#39;s basically no point in going for a 250GB drive. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB, and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives, coming in at around $90 to $150, are a decent bet, but the sweet spot for most is to opt for a 1TB drive, which should run you between $160 and $250. That will more than double the space you have available for games without breaking the bank. (Seagate’s official 1TB Xbox Series expansion card, for comparison, sells for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$220" href="https://amzn.to/3yejTrr">$220</a>.)</p><p>If you have the money, 2TB drives sometimes offer marginal savings per gigabyte, and can often be found when other models are out of stock. Unless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p><p>One final note: While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB SSD, you&#39;ll have, within margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games.</p><h2>What about external SSDs?</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f9a78850-01b4-11ec-bdf1-6047ddc9fc71" alt="Samsung T5 SSD" data-uuid="9b8670dd-cabf-369b-abb2-5fdce42dfcf5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>These are dramatically cheaper than the high-end internal SSDs, but there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PS4 games, or storing PS5 titles. This is useful if you have anything but the best internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or just want a large number of PS4 games to hand.</p><p>Due to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial X6" href="https://amzn.to/3ASyw56">Crucial X6</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T5" href="https://amzn.to/3mjYrPm">Samsung T5</a> being options we’ve tried and can recommend.</p><h2>What SSDs are compatible with PS5?</h2><h2></h2><p>The official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are still more things to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.</p><p>For speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing has shown that drives as slow as 4,800MB/s are accepted by the PS5, and using them to play a game that taps into the SSD regularly — such as <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> — causes no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn&#39;t match the Gen4 x4 spec.&nbsp;</p><p>In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues now, that doesn’t mean there won’t be games that will be problematic down the line. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec is not huge, and you may as well cover all your bases.</p><p>Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most bare SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 42mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.</p><p>It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink,” which is where most of the complications arise.</p><p>The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive. This is intensely specific, and rules out some popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs such as Corsair’s MP600 Pro and Sabrent’s Rocket 4 Plus. With time, it’s likely that manufacturers will want in on this new avenue for high-end SSD sales, and these heatsink size limits are going to become the de facto standard for the industry. In the meantime, however, only a couple of heatsinked drives fit out of the box.</p><p>If you’re looking to save some money, bare drives are often much cheaper and prevalent than their heatsinked alternatives, and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.</p><p>The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat. So, head to your PC component seller of choice, and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones popping up now that are labelled as “PS5 heatsinks.”</p><p>One recommendation is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this $7 copper heatsink" href="https://amzn.to/3xdeKiO">this $7 copper heatsink</a>, which attaches to the SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and really, performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall including the thermal interface material and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.</p><p>Now, if all of that was very boring, here are some ready-to-go recommendations:</p><h2>Best PS5 SSD: Patriot Viper VP4300</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab964370-01b6-11ec-8bff-65f2c8067859" alt="Patriot Viper VP4300" data-uuid="97fb5b32-e3fe-330e-b607-d170560a28b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Patriot</div></figure><p>Patriot may not be the biggest name in components, but it has a long history in the PC market, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Viper VP4300" href="https://amzn.to/3j2iPRD">Viper VP4300</a> is a solid drive for the PS5.

From an admittedly small sample, I’ve yet to hear of people being denied access to this; everyone I know who&#39;s applied was accepted within a week. You can enroll <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/ps5-beta-program-sign-up/">here</a> if you’re in the US, or you can google “PlayStation 5 System Software Beta Program sign-up” to find your local sign-up link.</p><p>Once you have the beta on your PS5, installation of a PS5 SSD is fairly straightforward. Sony recommends a #1 Phillips or crosshead screwdriver, but this isn&#39;t rocket science. Any crossed screwdriver of similar size will do fine.</p><p>Begin by powering down your PS5, unplugging everything, removing the stand and flipping it over to its underside. If you have the regular PS5, that’s the side with the disc drive, if you have the Digital Edition, it’s the side without the PlayStation logo cutout.</p><p>Sony has a video guide to popping off the outside cover <a href="https://youtu.be/CaAY-jAjm0w?t=133">here</a>, but the gist is you gently lift up the opposing corners and slide the panel towards the flat end of the console. There’s a knack to this, and it requires very little effort or strength. If you’re not getting it, rather than force it just readjust your grip and try again. A member of our video team managed to break one of the tabs on our review unit doing this last November so… yeah, don’t force it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ebf0c2f0-01b7-11ec-afbf-853a752af0d1" alt="Sony PlayStation 5 SSD slot" data-uuid="7398e559-d696-3bd4-a7d9-cd721de48919"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you’ve got everything open, you’ll see a rectangular piece of metal with a screw holding it in place. Remove that screw, and you’ll be able to access the drive bay.</p><p>You’ll see five holes inside, each numbered corresponding to the standard SSD drive lengths I mentioned earlier. The one numbered 110 will have a metal insert and screw inside. You need to unscrew the screw with a screwdriver, and then unscrew the insert with your fingers and move it to the relevant hole. Your eyes should tell you which is the right one for your drive, but it’s most likely going to be 80.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e67cea90-01b4-11ec-bbfb-4b7c19b43bb9" alt="PlayStation 5 SSD slot" data-uuid="b2916301-d0af-3271-9358-25c34f3b604e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then take your SSD — mine is a 980 Pro I bought on Prime Day with a $2 piece of aluminum attached to the top — and slot it in. The slot is at the edge closest to the number “30,” and SSDs are keyed to only fit in one way, so again, no force is required. If it’s not sliding in, don’t force it. You’ll notice the SSD doesn’t sit flat — that’s fine, and is as intended.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cbfb0a40-01b8-11ec-affd-fd9517dd0c1c" alt="Sony PlayStation 5 SSD upgrade" data-uuid="0e1237c5-5456-36b6-9c2d-d372b49da727"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once the SSD is seated, take the screw you removed from the insert, line it up with the little notch at the end of your SSD, and push down so it meets the insert.

When you first turn on the PS5, it’ll prompt you to format the drive. Do that! You have now successfully expanded your console’s storage, and can set about downloading and moving games to it. Personally, I moved all of the PS4 games I had to the new drive, along with all of my clips and screenshots. The PS5’s built-in SSD is always going to be the most compliant, so I’m keeping my important stuff there.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;ll be updating this guide as more SSDs come to market and onto our test bench, so feel free to bookmark it for when you need it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e75133dc-8c16-459b-9bf8-6f3892cd7c77</guid><dc:creator>Aaron Souppouris</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629470247</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T14:37:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Aaron Souppouris]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e67cea90-01b4-11ec-bbfb-4b7c19b43bb9" width="2560" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e67cea90-01b4-11ec-bbfb-4b7c19b43bb9" width="2560" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 SSD slot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 SSD slot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stunning 'Black Myth: Wukong' trailer shows off Unreal Engine 5 gameplay with DLSS on]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year after it wowed many with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/back-myth-wu-kong-trailer-193209475.html"><ins>first gameplay video</ins></a>, Chinese developer Game Science Studio is back with an even more impressive look at <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. The studio has switched from Unreal Engine 4 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html"><ins>UE5</ins></a> for the action RPG. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/black-myth-wukong-geforce-rtx-unreal-engine-5-nvidia-dlss-trailer/"><ins>According to NVIDIA</ins></a>, it&#39;s the first peek at a UE5 game that uses Deep Learning Super Sampling (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dlss"><ins>DLSS</ins></a>), the company&#39;s AI-powered upscaling tech.</p><div id="b25c978a06204b3b91be2a10498e5b57"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRDCCKiUSWo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The 12-minute preview, which you can watch in 4K at 60 frames per second, shows off much more action from the game. It features a couple of stunning boss fights, including one with an electric dragon on a frozen lake. The visuals here are eye-popping: expect buttery-smooth animations, gorgeous environments and dazzling snow and ice effects.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is based on the story of the Monkey King and the <em>Journey to the West</em>.

The gameplay and creature design certainly draw from the Souls-like approach popularized by From Software — for instance, you see the protagonist evading the terrible beasts&#39; attacks while looking for an opportunity to leap in with their staff.&nbsp;</p><p>The studio was formed by a group of former Tencent Games employees, according to prominent games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad. There&#39;s no confirmed release window as yet for <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Game Science Studio said last year it was aiming to bring the game to PC (which is a sure bet given the DLSS support) and consoles by 2023.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-wukong-trailer-unreal-engine-5-dlss-144528378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16e2d1b0-8e74-4430-a72e-f3732cb4b2cc</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:45:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629469598</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T14:26:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d35b7e20-01c0-11ec-bede-e18ec250d796" width="1919" height="953" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d35b7e20-01c0-11ec-bede-e18ec250d796" width="1919" height="953" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Game Science Studio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple has a new app for collecting feedback on Siri]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Apple may have released Siri before Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, in many ways its voice-activated assistant is the least advanced of the three. A lot of that has to do with the amount of data and training digital assistants need to understand different languages, dialects and speech patterns. In an effort to improve its digital assistant, Apple recently launched a study to collect speech data and feedback with the help of an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1564003829"><ins>Siri Speech Study</ins></a>.</p><p>“The Siri Speech Study app allows participants to send certain data to Apple for product improvement, as detailed in the informed consent form,” the company says in a listing spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. The software is available in the US, Canada, Germany, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Taiwan. According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, Apple uploaded Siri Speech Study to the App Store on August 9th, and recently updated the software on August 18th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple isn’t being exactly secretive about the app, but nor is it advertising its existence either. You can’t find the software by searching for it, nor is it listed as one of the apps published by Apple. Similarly, you can’t join the study simply by installing the software on your phone; you need an invite from Apple to participate. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple for more information on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the app allows those involved to choose what Siri requests they send to the company. That&#39;s an important point. In 2019, <em>The Guardian </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings"><ins>published a report</ins></a> that detailed an Apple program where third-party contractors listened to anonymized Siri recordings to analyze the assistant’s responses. A whistleblower told the outlet there had been “countless instances” where graders listened to private conversations, including some that involved criminal dealings and sexual encounters. Apple subsequently moved the program in-house, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-28-apple-siri-recording-user-data-changes.html?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter"><ins>switched to opt-in transcripts</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/siri-speech-study-app-142022577.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4034658-9dcb-4dda-a951-17fff3dee3ed</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:20:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629469227</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T14:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/ff858b80-b4af-11ea-b7ef-b4112c8cdda8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/ff858b80-b4af-11ea-b7ef-b4112c8cdda8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iOS 14 Siri interface]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 14 Siri interface]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro are 37 percent off at B&H Photo]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Samsung redesigned the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Galaxy Buds 2</a> with the budget-conscious in mind, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds Pro" href="https://fave.co/2W5cLk6">Galaxy Buds Pro</a> are its complete-package wireless earbuds. They debuted in January and we found them to be Samsung&#39;s best wireless earbuds to date — but they&#39;re also the company&#39;s most expensive at $200. But B&amp;H Photo has a limited-time sale going on right now that knocks 37 percent off the buds, bringing them down to $127.

They have a compact, comfortable design with an IPX7 waterproof rating, so you could use them while working out. Active noise-cancellation is solid, blocking out sounds from things like running dishwashers well, and Android users can download the companion mobile app to change noise-cancellation settings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The mobile app also lets you do things like enable hands-free Bixby and disable voice detection, which will automatically lower the volume and switch to ambient sound mode when you&#39;re speaking. We were also impressed by the buds&#39; sound quality — the 11mm woofer handles the low-end well and highs are crisp and punchy. The Galaxy Buds Pro also support 360 Audio, which is Samsung&#39;s equivalent to Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio on AirPods Pro.</p><p>As far as battery life goes, it&#39;s decent but nothing to write home about. You&#39;ll get roughly 18 hours of listening time out of the buds, and that includes the extra charges carried by its case. We do like that the case supports wireless charging, though, so you can sit them on any Qi pad in your home to get extra juice.

It apparently did, until the BBC asked the video-sharing site about these accounts. The report makes this sudden direction shift seem less, well, sudden.</p><p>OF will ban users from uploading photos and videos of &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; as of October 1st. Nudity will apparently still be allowed, as long as creators stick by OnlyFans&#39; Acceptable Use Policy.</p><p>Could the site suffer a similar fate to Tumblr? When that social network instituted a ban on adult content, it saw popularity plummet. OnlyFans is a little different in a few ways.

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://blog.liquid.com/warm-wallet-incident">Liquid</a> is the latest victim of a cyberattack that has seen hackers make off with an estimated $97 million in stolen assets. The funds include $45 million in Ethereum tokens, which the culprit is converting into Ether using decentralised exchanges to avoid them being frozen, according to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/liquid-exchange-hacked-94-million-stolen">Elliptic</a>, a crypto tracking firm that is assisting Liquid in its investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquid revealed on Thursday morning, Singapore time, that it had detected unauthorized access of some customers&#39; crypto wallets. The breach prompted it to halt all crypto withdrawals, though other services including fiat withdrawals and deposits were kept open. In its most recent update on Twitter, the company said it was tracking the movement of the stolen assets and working with other exchanges to freeze and recover the funds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The incident is the second major crypto heist to take place this month. Earlier, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-cryptocurrency-heist-returned-funds-133025946.html">hacker stole</a> — and quickly returned — about $611 million in in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other digital currencies from the decentralized Poly Network finance platform. The company later offered the as-yet unidentified perpetrator a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-rewards-crypto-hacker-121507483.html">bug bounty of $500,000</a> for helping to identify security vulnerabilities in its systems. However, it&#39;s unclear whether the reward was used as a bargaining tool or just a means of putting a positive spin on an otherwise damaging series of events.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither is this the first time a Japanese exchange has been targeted. Back in 2018, Tokyo-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-27-coincheck-hack.html">Coincheck</a> lost roughly $534 million worth of lesser-known crypto tokens in a hack.

Apple apparently expects staff to attend the office at least three days a week — Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays — with the option to work remotely on Wednesday and Friday.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The delay is the latest bout of disruption to Apple&#39;s business.

The same subset of workers also demanded a full-time remote work option.&nbsp;</p><p>On the retail side, Apple has repeatedly been forced to shutter its stores alongside the rise and fall of the virus. Just this week, it <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-shuts-store-more-20-190734346.html">closed</a> its store in Charleston, South Carolina, after more than 20 staff members were exposed to COVID-19.

Though, it quickly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/today-at-apple-in-person-classes-canceled/">backtracked</a> on its plan to restore <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-classes-104002065.html">in-store educational classes</a>.

It will also have backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 5 — Bethesda isn&#39;t keeping PS players out even after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">acquired</a> by Xbox, though Switch owners will have to get their copy on another console or PC.</p><p>The Anniversary edition contains the full game, along with all three of its expansions, namely Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn.

It later followed it up with the more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-5g-testing-endless-edge-snapdragon-765g-130047105.html">affordable and compelling Edge</a>. The company&#39;s newest phone, <a href="https://www.motorola.com/blog/post?id=298">announced today</a>, falls somewhere in between those two devices. It’s not quite a flagship, but nor is it entirely a mid-range device either. Internally, the 2021 Edge features up to 8GB of RAM, up to 256GB of internal storage and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-6nm-chip-150029217.html">Snapdragon 778G</a> processor.</p><p>That’s a step down from the Snapdragon 865 Motorola included with the Edge Plus, but what the 2021 Edge has going for it over its predecessors is a 6.8-inch display with a 144Hz refresh rate panel. Both the 2020 Edge and Edge Plus were limited to 90Hz, which should make the new model feel more responsive even with its mid-range processor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6c21bbc0-0134-11ec-85df-dd2263d9817d" alt="Motorola Edge" data-uuid="579c5f15-c3d9-317b-b85c-403d3ee61518"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>Motorola also reworked the camera module on the 2021 Edge. The phone now features a primary 108-megapixel sensor that uses pixel-binning technology to improve performance in low-light situations. Supporting the main camera is an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a lens that features a 119-degree field of view. Rounding out the camera array is a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, there’s a 32-megapixel shooter that can also take advantage of pixel binning.</p><p>The 2021 Edge comes with support for a variety of global LTE and sub-6GHz bands. It also comes with WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 and NFC connectivity, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">C-band support</a>, which will come in handy as Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) and AT&amp;T use the spectrum in their ongoing 5G build-outs. Speaking of Verizon, the carrier plans to offer a mmWave model later in the year.</p><p>Powering everything is a 5,000mAh battery Motorola says should provide up to two days of uptime. On the software front, the phone will ship with Android 11 and the company’s My UX skin. Motorola plans to support the phone with two major platform updates and two years of bi-monthly security patches.</p><p>What you won’t find on the 2021 Edge is support for wireless charging or robust waterproofing. It’s only IP52-certified. Most high-end phones these days feature either IP67 or IP68 water resistance.</p><p>Like it did with the Edge, the company plans to sell the 2021 model at a $200 discount for a “limited time.” Motorola hasn’t said how long the phone would cost $500. Pre-orders for the unlocked model open on August 23rd, with general availability to follow on September 2nd.

The Alphabet subsidiary just <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/MostExperiencedUrbanDriver.html"><ins>provided an update</ins></a> on its Waymo Driver AI as well as more details about its self-driving tests.</p><p>An array of LiDAR, radar and cameras can track what&#39;s going on all around the vehicle in a variety of weather conditions, Waymo says. The system generates a 3D view of the vehicle&#39;s surroundings that humans would be able to understand. Along with other cars, the system can render pedestrians in addition to cyclists who narrowly pass by the vehicle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="09484cec9ca246adb929d95d9013c613"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2u2HlTgEWY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company says Waymo Driver can detect small objects and movements at a distance, such as a truck door in the middle of traffic and someone jumping out to deliver a package. It claims the AI can recognize steam emanating from utility holes and drive the vehicle through it, and understand the difference between a stop sign and its reflection.</p><p>Waymo has been testing its vehicles in San Francisco since 2009 and it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymos-set-to-test-its-self-driving-taxis-in-san-francisco-195806282.html"><ins>ramped up its efforts</ins></a> in the city earlier this year. Its vehicles now clock north of 100,000 miles on SF&#39;s roads every week. Between narrow streets, drastic changes in elevation and intersections right at the top of hills, San Francisco isn&#39;t an easy city to drive in, which makes it an effective testing ground for AVs.</p><p>The company&#39;s vehicles have autonomously driven more than 20 million miles on public roads as well as 20 billion miles in simulations. That&#39;s a significant bank of data to draw from. Waymo says the AI can recognize and adapt to local driving behaviors, such as what lane to turn in at each intersection. According to the company, Waymo Driver can also mimic other vehicles&#39; behavior, such as in SF, where people tend to drive a little slower while going up steep slopes.</p><p>Fully autonomous driving is likely several years away from going mainstream, but it seems Waymo is making significant strides toward that goal. Hopefully, Waymo Driver is getting more comfortable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-213249367.html"><ins>around safety cones</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Waymo is beefing up its autonomous truck ambitions. On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/expanding-our-waymo-via-operations.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> that it&#39;s building a trucking hub in Dallas-Fort Worth and partnering with Ryder to manage its fleet.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla&#39;s AI Day event takes place today.

Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-14-call-of-duty-wwii-historic-warfare.html">2017&#39;s <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em></a><em>,</em> the studio&#39;s previous project as lead developer on the franchise, <em>Vanguard </em>takes the series back to where it all started: the Second World War.</p><p>After talking about the studio&#39;s commitment to diversity and creating a safe space for all employees, essentially repeating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html">same company line</a> Activision Blizzard executives have been saying ever since California <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">filed a sexual harassment lawsuit</a> against the publisher, Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon introduced  <em>Vanguard </em>director Josh Bridge and campaign director David Swenson. Bridge told us how the studio came out of <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em> feeling like it had only scratched the surface of the stories the conflict had to tell. &quot;We see [<em>Vanguard</em>] as being rooted in but not beholden to history. There is no revisionist history here,&quot; he said, a bullet point on his Powerpoint presentation reiterating the statement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/164d8890-00ea-11ec-abdf-e2fe16aa4da1" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="6882366a-9c1b-349b-a9f1-96f64d28e37b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>After showing the game&#39;s cinematic trailer and a snippet of gameplay, Swenson talked about the game&#39;s story. Like <em>The New Order</em>, <em>Vanguard</em> uses an alternate reality of the war to tell its story, but it appears a much less ambitious retelling on the surface. In a return to the way Infinity Ward did things when the series first started, <em>Vanguard</em>’s campaign will feature four playable characters, each loosely based on a different historical person.</p><p>In Polina Petrova, Sledgehammer took inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko">Lyudmila Pavlichenko</a>, a Soviet sharpshooter who was known as Lady Death for her 309 confirmed kills, the most of any female sniper in history. Wade Jackson, one of the other characters, is based on <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/article/20100804/NEWS/801247315">Vernon L. Micheel</a>, a US Navy pilot who bombed two Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway. Then there&#39;s Lucas Riggs. He draws from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Upham">Charles Upham</a>, the only soldier in World War II to earn two Victoria Cross medals.</p><p>Finally, you have Arthur Kingsley. His inspiration is <a href="https://www.pegasusarchive.org/normandy/sidney_cornell.htm">Sidney Cornell</a>, a Black British paratrooper who earned a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions in Normandy. To Sledgehammer&#39;s credit, the studio enlisted the help of science fiction writer <a href="https://www.tochionyebuchi.com/">Tochi Onyebuchi</a> to write Kingsley&#39;s character and cast Chike Okonkwo, best known for his role as Will in <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, to give him his voice.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a655ad0-00e9-11ec-bb1f-627f89322f0e" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="b2c6c7bb-23c4-3f30-8a09-bba9b1b7cfd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>Initially, those four find themselves in different theaters of the war, but they&#39;re eventually brought together to take part in a fictional mission called Operation Phoenix. The Nazis, under the guidance of a character named Heinrich Freisinger, have hatched a plan to survive the end of the war and it&#39;s up to the newly formed special forces team of Petrova, Jackson, Riggs and Kingsley to stop them. Like the four protagonists, Freisinger has a historical counterpart. He&#39;s based on the infamous Gestapo chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_M%C3%BCller_(Gestapo)">Heinrich Müller</a>.</p><p>Bridge said the studio sees the title as &quot;a filmic blockbuster, with a contemporary lens on history.&quot; The throughline that connects both the story and multiplayer components of the game is how the Second World War saw the birth of the modern idea of the special forces. This is World War II reframed as an entry point into the expanded Call of Duty universe. I won&#39;t say that&#39;s unexpected, but after Sledgehammer tried to tell a more nuanced story about PTSD in <em>CoD: WW2, </em>I had hoped it would set its sights even higher.</p><p>At the reveal event, Sledgehammer spent far more time talking about <em>Vanguard</em>’s story than letting the game speak for itself. Of the single-player campaign, the developer only showed a brief snippet of an early level that features Kingsley taking part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Tonga">Operation Tonga</a>, which saw British paratroopers land near the city of Caen during the Allied invasion of Normandy. If you&#39;ve seen <em>Band of Brothers</em>, you already know exactly how this segment plays out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a14b0130-00e9-11ec-b373-79933b383e00" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="d9379ea9-0ef5-3008-baeb-008e50d431d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>You jump out of a plane as part of a pre-scripted sequence in which you lose your rifle before landing on the ground. After a series of quick time events, your character finds himself in front of a field, an objective marker telling the player to make their way to a windmill in the distance. For part of the level, you have to sneak your way through enemy lines.</p><p>Other than an unexpected moment toward the end of the clip, nothing about what I saw struck me as something the franchise hasn&#39;t done before, but the execution was still compelling. True to the conditions Allied paratroopers found themselves in during the D-Day invasion, much of the mission takes place in suffocating fog and darkness. That gave the level more of a sense of atmosphere than your typical CoD mission. In particular, the use of lighting was intentional in a way I hadn&#39;t seen from the series in a while, the effect made more realistic by the work Sledgehammer and the other CoD studios did to update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-30-call-duty-modern-warfare-campaign-preview-may-2019.html"><em>Modern Warfare&#39;s</em></a> IW 8.0 engine.</p><p>What also struck me about this sequence was the stolen Kar98K Kingsley used to dispatch his Nazi pursuers. When he fired the bolt-action rifle, it let out a deafening blast and left enemies crumpled against the floor and walls. There was more physicality to the weapon than the assault rifles that usually dominate the CoD metagame. That &quot;down the barrel&quot; gameplay is something the studio said it spent a lot of the nearly four years since <em>CoD: WW2 </em>perfecting.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e608f750-00e9-11ec-9af7-0dfed3fdb43d" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="6ebf6a6d-8ff9-3f09-9de7-6287bfbd0e82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>It&#39;s hard to say if the rest of the single-player campaign adopts the more methodical pace to gunplay Sledgehammer showed off in the snippet I saw. However, I can state that multiplayer will feel familiar to current <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> and <em>Warzone</em> players. What you will find is that Sledgehammer designed the maps to feature more destructibility and interactive elements. A clip the studio shared showed off how you could shoot bookshelves, tables and boarded-up windows to open sightlines as a match progresses.</p><p>At launch, <em>Vanguard</em> will feature 20 multiplayer maps, 16 of which will support up to 12 players for six-on-six matches. Additionally, Sledgehammer is bringing Gunsmith back, a fan-favorite feature that allows you to customize your weapons with different attachments and ammo types. Naturally, Treyarch&#39;s Zombies mode is making a comeback, and it will connect to the lore established in <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>. Oh, and Raven Software is working on a <em>Warzone </em>map and update that will feature an all-new anti-cheat system. Sledgehammer promised to share more information about the multiplayer component of <em>Vanguard, </em>including details on a new mode called Champion Hill that the studio says will offer something new for players to experience, in the coming weeks.</p><p>That will give <em>Call of Duty</em> fans time to see if <em>Vanguard </em>is worth another trip to World War II before the game<em>&nbsp;</em>lands on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5 and PC via Battle.net on November 5th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-november-5-174533819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ee121b4-8672-42d3-ad47-74bc27971f4b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:45:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629395756</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T05:58:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a2d271b0-007f-11ec-b55d-e14ccf35a8ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a2d271b0-007f-11ec-b55d-e14ccf35a8ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sledgehammer Games / Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook is testing Reels in News Feed and Groups in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, some Facebook users in the US will see Reels, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html">Instagram’s take on TikTok-like short-form videos</a>, appear throughout the company&#39;s main app, the social media giant told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632223/facebook-reels-update-app-test-launch"><em>The Verge</em></a>.

As such, <em>NHL 22</em> marks the &quot;biggest leap forward&quot; for the franchise in terms of gameplay and graphics, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210819005570/en/EA-SPORTS%E2%84%A2-NHL%C2%AE-22-Delivers-a-Breakthrough-Hockey-Experience-Powered-by-the-Frostbite-Engine%E2%84%A2-Arrives-on-Current-Next-gen-Consoles-October-15/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SP7CEH_PxTjduXJ0SDrbU6qcp-o_pnudlUwsb5apQ1S4gUE65BTfjH3-pSuqdv0gW3cb3F4oTIgUqCPafFkgu67Ap_pA_yJ1XPgPy1DuJnY">according to EA</a>.</p><p>Developer EA Vancouver has seemingly made every stitch of player uniforms visible via high-res graphics. Player models have been overhauled as well. EA says Frostbite enables enhanced spatial awareness, with players having upgraded eye animations and the ability to track and react to what&#39;s going on around them. The publisher is promising &quot;new physically accurate stick interactions&quot; as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d30612367dc4c2e9056c7186ab5a7ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RKtpwPUzF0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A system called Superstar X-Factors brings unique moves to some of the more high-profile hockey pros with abilities based on their real-world traits. For instance, cover star and Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews&#39; Shock and Awe move allows you to let fly with &quot;exciting shots,&quot; while Andrei Vasilevskiy’s Contortionist ability plays into the Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender&#39;s body-twisting flair to let him pull off impressive saves. Superstar X-Factors will feature in the Franchise Mode, as well as the Be A Pro, Hockey Ultimate Team and World of Chel modes.</p><p><em>NHL 22 </em>is the first game in the series to have dedicated PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions. It&#39;s also coming to PS4 and Xbox One, but the standard edition doesn&#39;t include a free upgrade to the PS5/Series X/S versions through EA&#39;s Dual Entitlement system.</p><p>For that, you&#39;ll need to opt for the X-Factor edition, which includes extra Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) packs and other bonuses, as well as three days of early access. If you buy the <em>NHL 22 </em>X-Factor edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you&#39;ll also have access to the respective previous-gen versions. However, the only game progress you can move from previous-gen consoles to PS5 or Xbox Series X/S is your HUT team, and it&#39;s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-22/buy/nhl-22-dual-entitlement-faq">a one-time content migration</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The FIFA and Madden NFL games moved to Frostbite in 2016 and 2017 respectively, so NHL is lagging behind a bit. That said, Frostbite was primarily designed for Battlefield and other first-person shooters. Some EA studios, such as BioWare, have found the engine <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428"><ins>difficult to work with</ins></a> and had to build some of the tools they needed from scratch. That might go some way toward explaining why it took so long to move the NHL franchise over to Frostbite.</p><p><em>NHL 22 </em>will be released on October 15th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nhl-22-trailer-releasedate-ps5-xbox-series-x-frostbite-engine-172025536.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">216c0ce1-7bec-41fb-92eb-6ae0dbb866c8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:20:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629392974</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T17:09:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Ice Hockey]]></category><category><![CDATA[National Hockey League]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/68216900-010f-11ec-aab3-ad538265e127" width="1399" height="787" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/68216900-010f-11ec-aab3-ad538265e127" width="1399" height="787" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA Vancouver]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NHL 22]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NHL 22]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: Samsung's best foldable yet is still a tough sell]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="a4a35e09fb994fb880a69377ccbb6435"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0Nb3pv0DRg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">the Galaxy Z Flip 3</a><em>should </em>be the first foldable for a mainstream audience. It&#39;s basically a regular smartphone you can fold in half and it could appeal to the swaths of people who miss the satisfying snap of a flip phone. Plus, with a price drop, the new Flip now costs about the same as an iPhone or Galaxy S flagship. Samsung’s latest foldable also features a larger external display than its predecessor, making it more useful when closed, and has water resistance for some peace of mind. It’s even got a faster screen than Apple and Google offer and nifty software that makes better use of the screen when you prop it up on a surface. But the question remains, even at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:a more reasonable $1,000" href="https://fave.co/3gch6c6">a more reasonable $1,000</a>, is the Flip 3 good enough to usher foldables into the mainstream or are they still a gimmick?</p><h2>Design and durability</h2><p>One of the most important factors in determining if the Flip 3 is ready for daily use is durability. Samsung used stronger aluminum for the Flip 3’s frame, refined its hinge and made the screen tougher with a new flexible PET protector. I can’t tell exactly how much more durable the Flip 3 is compared to its predecessor, but I have been taking more risks with it. In fact, I consider my placing the Flip 3 (and the Fold 3, for that matter) into my bag along with my keys, laptop and DSLR the bravest thing I’ve ever done during a review.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’m mostly worried because of a bad experience when I took the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-24-hour-test-camera-samples-motorola-razr-comparison.html">original Z Flip out for a day</a>. It vibrated off a table and cracked its corner. I’ve been fairly careful with the Flip 3, but I’ve avoided babying it, and so far it’s survived being tossed into a bag with various sharp objects. While it’s still prone to sliding around due to its glossy glass exterior, it’s yet to fall off anything. I’ve placed it on treadmills, ellipticals, window ledges and restaurant tables and I don’t want to jinx it but: so far my Flip 3 is scratch-free.</p><p>Does that mean it’ll remain pristine a week, a month or even a year from now? Probably not. But as someone who’s cracked her fair share of phone screens, I feel like the Flip 3 is about as sturdy as most glass-covered flagships.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e443b4c0-00f6-11ec-8f7f-3ee177ea0dd6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 fully open, held vertically in a hand with its screen facing the camera." data-uuid="8672e604-4c18-39b4-93fa-2b64d4adbd74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>That is, with one exception: Its flexible internal screen is still more likely to break than others, if for no reason other than you’ll invariably end up pushing into some part of it to close the device. I’ve yet to damage the Flip 3’s screen, and I’ve been careful not to push my thumb into the middle of the panel to close the phone, but I’ve been shutting it with some force. Whether the durability is indeed improved is something that’s hard to tell without months of testing or deliberately trying to damage the device, so I might have to revisit this after some time.</p><p>Speaking of closing the phone: Like its predecessor, the Flip 3 isn’t easy to shut with one hand. It <em>can </em>be done, but the hinge is stiff and provides enough resistance to let it stay open at various angles. Unless you have Dwayne Johnson’s hands, you’ll probably need some leverage to open or close the Flip 3.</p><p>Oh and thanks to the IPX8 water resistance, I was a lot less worried about leaving the Flip next to my sink when I washed my face and dripped all over it while reaching for the soap.</p><p>Besides improved durability and a larger external screen, not much has changed between the new Flip and the last generation. They weigh the same 183 grams (6.45 ounces) and the Flip 3 is a hair thicker. Samsung’s also offering a few new color options, including my two favorites: green and lavender. My review unit is a boring cream/off-white, though.</p><p>Phones in the same size and price range like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">the iPhone 12 Pro</a> Max and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-s21-plus-s21-ultra-first-look-hands-on-150014483.html">Galaxy S21+</a> are slightly heavier and thicker, but not by much. Of course, these devices are dust-resistant and sport triple cameras, while the Flip has just two. The conventional flagships are also not as narrow. But aside from the aspect ratio, the Flip 3 feels very much like a regular smartphone when unfolded. Bonus: It’s more compact when folded in half, which helps it fit into most of my pockets without peeking out. It actually almost reminds me of a pager when closed. Remember those?</p><section data-eng-breakout="a4210a0b68344d1b9a58f11860df9cad" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30c239c0-00f7-11ec-9fd8-797a1246144d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded, with its Cover Display showing a cartoon animal and the time."></section><h2>A bigger, more useful Cover Display</h2><p>The greatest difference between the Flip 3 and a typical smartphone is that you can close it, which is not only a satisfying means of putting your phone away, but also introduces a new way to interact with the device. The 1.9-inch external screen is four times larger than the previous model, and can show up to four lines of notifications at once. There are currently six widgets available for this window, which Samsung calls the Cover Display. To interact with this panel, you’ll have to first double tap on it, then swipe vertically or horizontally to see your notifications or widgets respectively.</p><p>This was a little confusing initially, as I didn’t know I needed to tap the screen before swiping. But after figuring it out, I’ve come to appreciate it because it prevents accidentally dismissing notifications and skipping songs on Spotify. That’s pretty helpful since I often unintentionally touch the Cover Display when closing the phone or picking it up.</p><p>Most of the time, I leave the Flip 3 closed until I need to reply to a message or when I start browsing my feeds. It’s certainly a lot less distracting to be able to put my phone aside and not have a long list of notifications that I can see from a distance. I initially set all six widgets to appear on my Cover Display, so scrolling sideways would bring up the weather, media controls, Samsung Pay, Health, Calendar and so on.</p><p>While I appreciated having all those options, after a while it became clear three widgets is plenty  — the endless swiping got tiring eventually. The software is also a little buggy at the moment. The alarms widget, for example, will randomly abandon its countdown if you pause and resume it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a7220730-00f7-11ec-877f-cd30e99d43ce" alt="A hand holding the closed Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 with its Cover Display facing the camera." data-uuid="60df54bd-7dde-3300-bb3d-32a38aa253f0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Another feature that sounds great in theory is using your Cover Display as a viewfinder. With the larger panel, you’ll have more room to frame up your selfies on the Flip 3 with the screen closed. I used it to snap a picture with three staff members of my building and while we were able to squeeze everyone in, the novelty wore off quickly.</p><p>The only time I can see preferring the outside screen as a viewfinder is if you need the sharper or wider rear cameras or when you’re really in a hurry and can’t spare the one or two seconds it takes to open the phone. I like that Samsung gives us this option, but even a selfie-obsessed person like me was never in that much of a rush to snap a portrait. Plus, the photos taken this way end up in a strange squarish crop, while those snapped using the main screen as a viewfinder are taller or wider.</p><h2>Internal screen and Flex mode</h2><p>When you’re back on the main screen, aspect ratio is still somewhat of an issue. The Flip 3’s 6.7-inch display runs at 2,640 x 1,080, which comes up to an uncommon 22:9 format. This didn’t cause too many problems — most apps fit nicely on the screen — but every now and then something will overflow. The pop-up dialogs in <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, for example, disappear into the edges of the display and I can barely tap the buttons I need to move on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dba5c8c0-00f7-11ec-beb2-ed4299ddc48d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 held horizontally between two hands, with the screen showing the Settlers of Catan app with " data-uuid="b4684c29-b27b-3671-b283-90a635a09521"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fortunately, I didn’t encounter this on most of my frequently used apps, but for now Samsung doesn’t have a workaround to help ensure you can see everything on the Flex.</p><p>That’s my main issue with the Flip 3’s internal screen, which is otherwise a lovely canvas for browsing Instagram and YouTube thanks to its flexible AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Images were vibrant with deep blacks and high contrast, and the display never stuttered when I scrolled my feeds in a frenzy. Oh I also didn’t mind the crease in the middle — yes it’s noticeable and does cause some distortion, but it doesn’t get in the way of readability. I also like how it felt beneath my thumb as I scrolled past it. It’s like stroking a soft, naked tendon, which is a lot better than it sounds.</p><p>Another update that makes the Flip 3 a better multimedia device than before are its stereo speakers. Now, when you hold it up to watch a video, you’ll hear its audio from both ends. It’s a little too easy to cover the bottom speaker with your hand when holding the phone horizontally, though.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0b4e8f30-00f8-11ec-afef-ec57a35b496e" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded to prop itself up on a table, with the top half of its screen showing a YouTube video and the bottom showing the title, likes, dislikes, channel, top comment and suggested videos." data-uuid="6bb984da-d64e-3147-942b-d91190dc65e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Something else the Flip offers that regular smartphones don’t is a Flex mode that kicks in when you half-fold the device. This only works on some apps, like Gallery, Camera and YouTube, where the screen is split in half to show your photo, viewfinder or video on top and navigation, controls or more info at the bottom. When you set the Flip 3 up on a table in Flex mode, you can watch your show as if it were full screen on the top half, while scrolling comments or suggested videos below.</p><p>I thought I’d only find Flex mode useful with the Flip 3 sitting on a table (propped up like it has its own kickstand), but it actually was more helpful in enabling one-handed use. Because the screen is so tall, some elements are out of my thumb’s reach. Flex mode makes scrolling pictures in my gallery or snapping a picture much easier with one hand. So far, though, only a handful of apps support this, so Samsung will need to work harder to make more of them compatible.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The Flip 3’s dual 12-megapixel cameras hold their own against the likes of the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. While Samsung, Apple and Google all have minor differences in the color temperature of their photos, they deliver similar quality and clarity in most situations. The Flip 3’s picture of a yummy bowl of noodles was just as bright and vibrant as those taken with the Pixel and iPhone, though it’s a little soft and failed to capture some detail on the ceramic surface.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e42f380-00f8-11ec-9f6e-75cb94987b1f" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&#39;s Cover Display and dual 12-megapixel cameras next to it." data-uuid="63cc2bea-cb10-349b-af5a-b0af50cf887c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Photos the Flip 3 shot at night are also similar to those from the competition — you’d need to really scrutinize minor exposure and noise differences to tell them apart. The pictures I snapped of a dog park and the city skyline at night all came out bright and colorful, though Google delivered a better closeup of the New York City nightscape thanks to its superior processing software.</p><p>The selfies captured by the Flip 3’s 10-megapixel camera were also bright and sharp. And, based on an informal poll on my Instagram, the majority of my followers preferred a portrait shot by the Flip 3 to the Pixel 5.</p><section data-eng-breakout="881a9243ddf54db79e4e9b4e4c2b7d57" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1969980-00f8-11ec-ba9f-8771adb574e7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 unfolded in someone&#39;s hand, with its rear facing the camera"></section><h2>Living the foldable life: In use and battery</h2><p>With a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Flip 3 performed smoothly during my testing. I haven’t encountered many delays when using the main screen to message my friends, post to Twitter and browse websites. It didn’t let up even as I recorded the screen while using the camera to capture footage of my friends trying to perform TikTok dances, either.</p><p>Occasionally, I felt like websites were scrolling more slowly than I was used to, and there are still some small software bugs (like the Cover Display’s alarm widget) that make the Flip 3 feel like it needs a bit more polish. But aside from these minor gripes and the fact that you can fold it, this phone feels very similar to its Samsung siblings.</p><p>That is, until we consider battery life. The Flip 3 never made it through a full day before needing a charge, and that runtime dropped when I enabled the Always On Display for the outer screen. On our video rundown test, the Flip 3 only clocked 11 hours and 27 minutes, which is shorter than most flagships I&#39;ve tested recently. The S21’s 4,000mAh cell typically stuck around for a day and a half, while the latest Pixels and iPhones easily outlast the Flip 3. Despite offering a larger Cover Display and a higher refresh rate on its main panel, the Flip 3’s 3,300mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, which might explain its disappointing endurance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/423d19c0-00f9-11ec-bdd7-634abf3e7174" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded and propped up in tent mode on a table." data-uuid="2e07df85-cb93-324a-9610-12f3638b8601"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After spending some time with the Flip 3 in the real world, I’ve come to realize a few things: I like being able to fold a phone, put it away and focus on work or living in the moment. But I can also turn a regular phone face down to do that. I enjoy the nostalgia and novelty of closing the Flip 3 when I’m mad at a caller or an app, too.</p><p>In general, the satisfaction and space savings from being able to fold a phone in half are not worth paying a premium for. The good news is that with the Flip 3, Samsung isn’t charging a hefty premium or making many compromises. Battery life is an unfortunate victim of the Flip 3’s larger external screen, but it’s at least not so short that you’ll need to charge it twice a day.</p><p>Ultimately, the Flip 3 is proof that Samsung can deliver a good phone with a foldable display at a relatively reasonable price. It’s also a satisfying upgrade from its predecessor, thanks to its water resistance and bigger outside screen. The most important question now is: Who should buy this? If you pride yourself on being an early adopter and want to get on the foldables bandwagon before they become more common, that might be you. The Flip 3 is a device capable of being a daily driver for those nostalgic or curious enough to buy one. But for a more mainstream audience, there simply aren’t enough benefits yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, thanks to water resistance and a larger, more useful Cover Display. Its $1,000 starting price puts it in the same class as flagships from Apple, Google and Samsung itself, too. While it mostly behaves like a regular modern smartphone that you can fold in half, the Flip 3 is held back by battery life and potential durability issues.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 or 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor (2.84Ghz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz)</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 8GB with 128/256GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Main display</strong>: 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display</p><p><strong>Main display resolution</strong>: 2,640 x 1,080 (22:9)</p><p><strong>External display</strong>: 1.9-inch Super AMOLED</p><p><strong>External display resolution</strong>: 260 x 512</p><p><strong>Rear (or external) cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera with OIS and 78-degree FOV, 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (123-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front (or inside) camera</strong>: 10MP f/2.4 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with One UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 3,300mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C with fast wired charging at 15W (QC2.0 and AFC) and fast wireless charging at 10W (WPC and PMA).
