Speaking during the company’s second-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook.” And on Instagram, TikTok competitor Reels is the “largest contributor to engagement growth.”</p><p>Though he stopped short of sharing more specific stats, the new details suggest Instagram’s Reels may be gaining more traction as the company vies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">for creator talent</a>. Zuckerberg also noted that the company’s focus on creators and shopping would also help it reach its longer term goal of becoming a “metaverse company.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook revealed earlier this week that it was tapping an Instagram exec to start a new team focused on creating a metaverse. “You can kind of think about this as an embodied internet that you&#39;re inside of rather than just looking at,” Zuckerberg said. “You&#39;re basically gonna be able to do everything that you can on the internet today, as well as some things that don&#39;t make sense on the internet today like dancing.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s comments come as the company reported some of its strongest growth in years, with revenue of more than $29 billion, an increase of 56 percent from last year. The company also reported more than 3.5 billion “monthly active people,” though user growth in the US once again remained flat.</p><p>Despite the strong numbers this quarter, the company warned that the rest of 2021 could look very different. Facebook expects revenue and growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of the year, said CFO Dave Wehner. He also noted that Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which allows users to opt out of the social network’s ad tracking, would have a “greater impact” next quarter.<em></em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6199e11-9eba-4fcd-bbdf-94d270d59271</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 21:43:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627509814</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T22:03:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SUN VALLEY, IDAHO - JULY 08: CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks to lunch following a session at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 08, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Created by YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober, the Dominator is the result of more than five years of work. Rober had help from two freshmen from Stanford University and a Bay Area software engineer in creating the <a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot"><ins>googly-eyed robot</ins></a>. The group programmed more than 14,000 lines of code, and outfitted it with components like omnidirectional wheels and 3D-printed funnels to create what Rober says is a “friendly robot that’s super good at only one thing: setting up a butt-ton of dominos really, really fast.”</p><div id="01dc59faf64741ee9bbd306bd111e18d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HEfIJlcFbs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Up against professional domino artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smZYelKX18&amp;t=0s"><ins>Lily Hevesh</ins></a>, the Dominator used its ability to lay down 300 tiles all at once to work about 10 times faster than a human. It took the robot about two hours to put down over 9,000 dominos.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Dominator is the face of the project, a lot of its efficiency comes from a separate sorting mechanism that consists of a Kuka robotic arm and almost three miles of Hot Wheels tracks. A series of conveyor belts ferry the dominions by color before the Kuka arm deposits them in the appropriate chute. When the Dominator visits the station for a refill, the lower platform slides away, instantly loading its 3D-printed funnels with all the dominos it needs to lay down 300 at once. In this way, downtime is kept at a minimum.</p><p>To put its final achievement in context, it would take a team of seven skilled domino builders about a full week to make the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-like mural the Dominator needed a little more than a day to complete.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dominator-video-211106466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af9e0bf7-e180-4499-8add-7b4ef1bfba58</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 21:11:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627506670</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T21:11:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/edf82030-efe6-11eb-a9fd-138bc340af5a" width="1000" height="625" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/edf82030-efe6-11eb-a9fd-138bc340af5a" width="1000" height="625" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mark Rober]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dominator]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dominator]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The NBA is working with iHeartMedia to produce over 20 basketball podcasts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Basketball Association is <a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/press/iheartmedia-and-nba-team-multi-year-podcast-partnership-present-groundbreaking-slate-nba">teaming up with iHeartMedia</a> for a significant new push into the podcast market.

I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.”</p><p>Kotick claims Blizzard Activision is taking “swift action” to ensure a safe, respectful and inclusive working environment for women and other minority groups. The company has hired law firm <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/en">WilmerHale</a> to review its policies, and Kotick says Activision Blizzard will implement changes to its hiring practices. It also plans to make personnel tweaks and remove content from its games employees and players have said is “inappropriate” in light of the allegations against the company. On Tuesday, the World of Warcraft development team said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wow-remove-inappropriate-references-california-lawsuit-035510730.html">remove specific references from the MMO</a>. While the team didn’t elaborate, those references may involve items and non-playable characters named after Alex Afrasiabi, one of the former Blizzard employees singled out in the DFEH lawsuit for repeated inappropriate behavior.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, the letter doesn’t make mention of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-riot-games-walk-out-sexism-lawsuits-arbitration.html">forced arbitration</a>, saying only the company “will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action,” nor does it promise greater transparency when it comes to employee compensation. Those are two issues Activision Blizzard employees who are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-activision-walkout-184945869.html#">staging a walkout</a> to protest for better working conditions highlighted in a statement of intent they shared on Tuesday.</p><p>In its initial public response to the lawsuit, Activision Blizzard said the allegations from DFEH included “distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past.” In a separate email to employees, Frances Townsend, executive vice president of corporate affairs at the company, claimed the lawsuit presents “a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f46a34b4-fd16-40a2-a470-58877c09e8f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 17:25:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627493142</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T17:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/eafeab50-8764-11eb-97ad-91d4b0437865" width="3500" height="2435" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/eafeab50-8764-11eb-97ad-91d4b0437865" width="3500" height="2435" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard, speaks at the Reuters Global Media Summit in New York November 30, 2010.

You&#39;ll also see safety details the developer chooses to highlight, such as whether an app encrypts your data, whether it&#39;s suitable for children and families and whether it&#39;s been independently validated against a global security standard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5917b2b0-ef8b-11eb-bcfa-5abd5aa4f796" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Google" data-uuid="928595c1-3b71-304b-8acb-01e1c985d041"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Further, you can tap the summary to see more details about the type of data an app collects and how it&#39;s used. It can show you whether an app collects location and contact data, personal information such as name and email address, as well as financial information. The section can also tell you whether the app uses your data for its features, for personalization or for other purposes.

Sony has <a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/a-new-milestone-sie-sells-10-million-playstation-5-consoles-globally/">revealed</a> that it has sold 10 million PS5 consoles as of July 18th, eight months after the system&#39;s November 12th debut. The company considered that no mean feat between the pandemic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-gaming-chief-says-the-ps-5-would-be-sold-out-even-without-covid-19-124538616.html">ongoing chip shortages</a> that reportedly held sales back.

Sources tell the site that Tesla will instead focus on finding cheaper spaces, like parking lots and warehouses, that will house a remote fleet of cars. The company also won&#39;t be firing its retail staff (it&#39;s actually in the <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/22/tesla-tsla-salesforce-hiring-spree-demand-us/">middle of a hiring spree</a>). Instead of being tied to individual stores, those workers will help to manage Tesla testing and purchases from those remote locations.</p><p>If this news sounds familiar, it&#39;s because Tesla previously said it was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-28-teslas-car-sales-are-going-online-only.html">close most of its stores</a> in 2019 before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-11-tesla-decides-to-keep-more-stores-open-and-raise-prices-instead.html">quickly reversing course</a>. This new strategy, if it ends up being implemented, seems to be a smarter implementation of that plan. Most Tesla customers already buy their cars online, so there&#39;s less of a need to have pricey mall stores around. The cheaper locations will also be better for holding more vehicles, which should help to satisfy increased demand for purchases and test drives.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-stores-high-end-malls-remote-fleets-142829801.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8a2a08d-8778-423a-a0b1-1fe0904c7703</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:28:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627482512</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T14:28:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9d249360-efae-11eb-9347-56aa82530c42" width="3500" height="2241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9d249360-efae-11eb-9347-56aa82530c42" width="3500" height="2241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hannibal Hanschke / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla car 'Model S' sits in a dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015.

As the name suggests, the latest member of the family is a true wireless set (and the company’s first model without a wired option). As you might expect, Nura’s flagship automatic hearing test (for sound tailored to your hearing) is here, along with many other features the company has already made synonymous with its brand. But with a smaller form factor, are compromises inevitable?</p><p>The Nuratrue ($199/£199) is a simplified version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-03-nura-nuraphones-review.html"><ins>Nuraphone </ins></a>over-ears and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuraloop-wireless-headphones-review-120007318.html"><ins>Nuraloop </ins></a>wireless (but tethered) sports buds. As mentioned, the audio customization feature is present, as is the “ambient” mode — which Nura calls “social mode.” There’s even Active Noise Cancelling and “immersion” mode, which simulates the feeling of being at a live event. The last two are a little simplified compared to their bigger siblings, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original Nuraphone’s immersion mode delivers tactile bass with transducers creating a sensation of volume and presence similar to being in front of a large speaker. On the Nuratrue, it feels more like a bass “boost” feature you might find on an equalizer. Active Noise Cancellation on the Nuratrue works pretty well, but is tied to the social mode feature which means they are activated as a pair. This makes no real functional difference, but something to bear in mind. Battery life is estimated at six hours here and seems accurate, which can be extended to around 24 hours via the charging case.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eef58e40-ef7e-11eb-b5bd-586bc02fc4c2" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="d4f3ebed-4ee4-3437-b2f0-8057b61ab44e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you were a fan of the Nuraloop, you might have expected the Nuratrue to be broadly the same, minus the connecting cable. But you’d be wrong. The new buds barely share any visual or physical DNA with their cabled sibling. Instead the Nuratrue has a much larger, circular body which sorta looks like you’re wearing “plugs,” but in the middle of your ear. This extra size might sound like a negative, but it makes them easier to touch (for controls) and likely helps keep them wirelessly connected to each other.</p><p>That “touchability” is important, as, like most TWS earphones, it’s how you’ll interact with them — in particular, for activating things like immersion or social mode. (ANC can only be toggled via the app it seems, and as mentioned disables social mode with it). In my testing with them the touch was more responsive than most other TWS headphones I’ve tried, especially the tricky double-tap which I find often requires a few attempts to register correctly. As with all Nura headphones you can easily assign different tasks to either side for both single and double taps, making it easy to have the controls you use the most at hand (or finger, technically).</p><p>Obviously, the main selling point here is Nura’s proprietary audio personalization. The ability to create personal hearing profiles is kinda Nura’s whole <em>thing</em>. It’s a feature you see on other brands, too, but Nura’s is the simplest and, in my experience, the most reliable. Mostly, because it doesn’t involve any subjectivity. Just pop the buds in your ears, walk through the profile creation process in the app and the headphones do everything else. Most other similar “tests” require you to tell the app how well/if you heard something. As someone who’s done more than their fair share of hearing tests, I always start imagining phantom sounds and worry that affects my results.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2be14240-ef7f-11eb-95ef-2ac45793c076" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="9c5efb9d-4837-31e9-bbbb-00680b14a3fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cool features are… cool and all, but you probably just want to know how they sound? I guess the smart answer is, that will depend on your ears. The slightly more helpful answer is that, for me, the personalized audio definitely puts the Nuratrue above most of the TWS headphones I have tried. It’s not that they have better bass or polished treble, although those would be fair statements, it’s more that they feel neutral and balanced.</p><p>Whereas “unpersonalized” buds may be technically balanced on a graph, I know that my hearing isn’t perfect and thus might be slightly worse at certain frequencies. With Nura’s personalized tuning, it’s hard to know what frequency curve I am getting, or even if that’s what my hearing really “needs” but what I do know is that I like it!</p><p>Now, I guess I should also say that I am never sure just how effective Nura’s hearing test really is. The company claims that it uses <a href="https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/otoacoustic-emissions/">otoacoustic emissions</a> to determine the characteristics of your hearing. The same test is sometimes used to determine cochlear hearing loss in newborns. That said, every time I’ve been to an audiologist (which is more times than I would like) I have asked them about using OAE tests for headphones, and all of them have been skeptical it can be done on hardware at this price. When I asked Nura about this, they gave the following reply:</p><p>“The OAE signal produced by a person&#39;s ears is indeed faint - much like the signals of GPS satellites are faint by the time they reach the Earth&#39;s surface. That&#39;s why GPS-enabled devices of 20-15 years ago were much larger, less accurate, and took longer to acquire a signal than today&#39;s smartphones or even smartwatches. Similar advances in signal processing have enabled the huge improvement in GPS device performance and the quick &amp; reliable measurements of OAEs in devices as small as Nuratrue.”</p><p>In short, the company claims that advances in technology have allowed for the test to be practical in small, consumer devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/50366800-ef7f-11eb-8cff-18d24091138f" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="eeccb67b-bcbe-36cc-ab90-d6e5bd5ecdb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Back to the physical design briefly. It might not be for everyone, but it feels very much in keeping with Nura’s apparent mission to do things a little bit differently. I’ve never really found a TWS design that I think has fully cracked it (although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html"><ins>Jabra’s Elite 75t</ins></a> comes close?), and that’s true here. But, as mentioned earlier, I do appreciate the large surface area for controlling playback or activating/deactivating the extra features. Extended wear remains comfortable, and the fit works well for my ears.</p><p>If I had one minor gripe, it’d be the maximum volume. It’s not low. In fact, for me, it’s more or less ideal for comfortable, extended use. It’s just that, “comfortable” is the maximum, so when a song comes on that I really love and I decide that, heck, I can crank this one up a bit before going back to normal levels… there’s nowhere to go. Again, this might not be an issue for you. I’ll be the first to admit I probably haven’t done my ears any favors over the years, but it was something I noticed fairly quickly in my time with the Nuratrue.</p><p>In an ocean of true wireless headphones, it’s hard to stand out. But Nura’s personalized audio is certainly enough to do just that. Of all the “customizable” headphones I’ve tried, Nura’s are still the ones to beat. And with the Nuratrue priced at least $80 cheaper than the flagship models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html"><ins>Sennheiser </ins></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html"><ins>Bose</ins></a>, that’s just another easy way for the company to garner attention.</p><p>The Nuratrue is available starting today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">296e041f-cc23-40c6-a533-1b50a3a95285</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627465321</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T09:42:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a0e8490-eee9-11eb-bbff-5bcf24e5afe0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a0e8490-eee9-11eb-bbff-5bcf24e5afe0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nuratrue review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nuratrue review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Archived WhatsApp chats will no longer come back to haunt you]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your archived <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-app-lets-you-use-different-wallpapers-for-individual-chats-080121431.html">WhatsApp chats</a> will no longer resurrect themselves — unless you let them.

Today, the audio giant was proved right, as new signups fell to nine million new users in the <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx">most recent quarter</a>. That said, slower growth isn’t always a bad thing. Of that nine million figure, seven million users signed up for Premium, versus just two million who went ad-supported. It means that Spotify was also able to announce a second successive quarter of profitability after a long period of losses.</p><p>The total number of Spotify users now stands at 365 million, of which 165 million are paying for Premium, while the remaining 210 are ad-supported. Converting more of Spotify’s vast ad-supported user base into Premium users is one way to ensure the company remains profitable. Another, of course, is to boost its growing advertising business, which has been bolstered by Spotify’s numerous podcast offerings. The company said that it saw “triple digit” year-on-year gain in ad-sales for the company’s owned podcast outlets, including The Ringer, Parcast and Gimlet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last three months has seen Spotify intensify work to push users toward cheaper forms of audio content than music. It says that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">Joe Rogan’s</a> podcast has performed “above expectations,” while shows out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-05-spotify-buys-the-ringer.html">The Ringer</a> saw big bumps in listenership as the NBA headed into the playoff season. No mention this month of how many people are tuning in to listen to former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen hang out, which was the second biggest podcast on the platform from the start of the year.</p><p>As for the future, Spotify says that it’s hoping to add at least 12 million more users in total, and at least another five million more paying customers. It is still expecting to reach the coveted 400 million user figure by the end of the year, although given the uncertainties still present with COVID-19, you never can be sure.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-q2-2021-premium-users-103530500.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94d0ec5d-6309-4645-801b-9126cab3b915</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 10:35:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627478287</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T13:18:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-02/f937c040-2a0e-11e9-b2b8-b86eee421003" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/f937c040-2a0e-11e9-b2b8-b86eee421003" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Coppola via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BROOKLYN, NY - AUGUST 09:  Spotify CEO Daniel Ek speaks onstage during Samsung Unpacked New York City at Barclays Center on August 9, 2018 in Brooklyn City.

The robot had to learn to make infinite subtle adjustments to be able to accomplish the feat. Yesh Godse, an undergrad from the OSU Dynamic Robotics Laboratory, explained: &quot;Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful method in AI that opens up skills like running, skipping and walking up and down stairs.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team first tested Cassie&#39;s capability by having it run on turn for five kilometers, which it finished with a time of 43 minutes and 49 seconds. Cassie finished its run across the OSU campus in 53:03. It took a bit longer because it included six and a half minutes of dealing with technical issues. The robot fell once due to a computer overheating and then again after it executed a turn too quickly. But Jeremy Dao, another team member from the lab, said they were able to &quot;reach the limits of the hardware and show what it can do.&quot; The work the team does will help expand the understanding of legged locomotion and could help make bipedal robots become more common in the future.</p><div id="1f74672132fe4a1081acd7d08dcbff43"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSaSjd_HOaI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-cassie-bipedal-robot-run-5k-093045955.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7482a1ed-7ef7-40b5-ad78-ed266c1be7a9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627475790</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T12:36:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Agility Robotics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG will reportedly sell iPhones in its South Korean stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rumors swirled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-iphones-to-be-sold-lg-stores-korea/">last week</a> that LG would start selling iPhones in some of its South Korean stores, since it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-mobile-worldwide-shutdown-020959355.html">stopped producing</a> its own smartphones,.

As such, when LG started to consider selling iPhones, it reportedly faced resistance from a smartphone reseller trade organization.

The company has 400 stores in South Korea, so the move could provide a significant boost to Apple.
