VW Group chief Herbert Diess has <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041">announced</a> that his company will debut the reincarnated microbus on March 9th. He didn&#39;t share more beyond a sketch, but VW&#39;s testing of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-buzz-electric-minivan-arrives-as-a-self-driving-prototype-125030104.html">self-driving prototype</a> suggests the finished van won&#39;t lose many of the design cues from the nostalgia-inspired concept.</p><p>The ID.Buzz is expected to launch in Europe later in 2022, and reach American shores in 2023. You&#39;ll have to &#39;settle&#39; for the passenger-focused long-wheelbase model in the US where Europeans will get short-wheelbase and commercial models. Europe is also more likely to get a self-driving variant, too. Entry models could start with rear wheel drive models that offer up to 200HP, while the range-topper could include AWD and 300HP. You may see up to three battery capacities.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Buzz might not be as mass market-friendly as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">the ID.4</a> and other more conventional models, but it could still be one of VW&#39;s most important EVs. Like the Beetle, VW&#39;s microbus design remains iconic. The Buzz could serve as a halo vehicle whose cachet attracts buyers to the brand&#39;s overall EV lineup, even if they ultimately settle for another model.</p><div id="accbe979b16046bda66c89488754fe55"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The legend returns on 03/09/22! <a href="https://t.co/Q4hFyCN5mr">pic.twitter.com/Q4hFyCN5mr</a></p>— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vw-id-buzz-microbus-reveal-date-173402540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dac16427-38a6-41e7-9c24-6577fd351376</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:34:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641489969</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T17:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New York Times is reportedly buying subscription-based sports site The Athletic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-the-athletic-sports-news-subscription-podcasts.html"><em><ins>The Athletic</ins></em></a>, which quickly came to prominence for publishing <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nwsl-uswnt-players-call-for-investigation-after-coach-paul-riley-accused-of-sexual-coercion-171549998.html"><ins>exclusive reporting</ins></a> and high-quality sports journalism, is getting a new owner.

All of Bowie&#39;s post-2000 studio albums (<em>Heathen</em>, <em>Reality</em>, <em>The Next Day</em> and <em>Blackstar</em>) plus a live album (<em>A Reality Tour</em>) have been remixed in Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">360 Reality Audio</a> for release on Amazon Music Unlimited, Deezer and Tidal on January 21st. You can also listen to four of the <em>A Reality Tour</em> songs today (January 6th) at 7PM Eastern through <a href="https://square.sony.com/ces2022/360ra/">Sony Square</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKezF4XDLq4">YouTube</a>, and through the <a href="https://music.artistconnection.net/sharedContent?token=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;studioUuid=faa1b390-624b-4f6a-a703-6e535cb40d90&amp;shareableId=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;mobileOnly=true&amp;studioId=2&amp;url=https:%2F%2Fapi.demo.artistconnection.net">Artist Connection</a> mobile app afterward.</p><p>Importantly, longtime Bowie producer Tony Visconti was responsible for the mixes. This is as close as you&#39;ll get to a Bowie-approved mix in 2022, in other words, and it&#39;s a fitting tribute for the rock legend&#39;s imminent 75th birthday. You can use any headphones to listen in 360 Reality Audio, although Sony would clearly prefer you use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">its products</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This won&#39;t satisfy fans who want 360-degree mixes of full classic albums like <em>Hunky Dory</em> or <em>Low</em> (really, the album with &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; didn&#39;t get a rework?). You likewise won&#39;t be thrilled if you prefer services like Apple Music or Spotify. Only a handful of Bowie songs have received the spatial audio treatment to date, though — this is still a treat for enthusiasts eager for some audio bliss.</p><div id="2d17e6cee5d64db8910dab6cce5e5559"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKezF4XDLq4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/david-bowie-360-degree-audio-mix-164016924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d39cee43-6dde-40b2-9cdd-83e6913ccc0f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:40:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641484706</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T15:58:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shaun Best / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[David Bowie performs his North American debut of "A Reality Tour" in Montreal, December 13, 2003.

The company has packed more features into the product, such as the ability to monitor body temperature. The graphite-infused foam mattress can cool or heat each side of the bed to maintain each person&#39;s preferred temperature throughout the night. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-sleep-number-climate360.html"><ins>Climate360 mattress</ins></a> also has such a feature.

That can prompt the bed to raise your head to mitigate moderate snoring. In addition, the bed can tilt entirely to open your airway and help you breathe more easily while keeping your spine properly aligned.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the core ideas behind the latest model is that it&#39;s designed to adapt to your changing needs.

Eventually, it may be able to monitor for signs of insomnia, sleep apnea or cardiac events and alert the sleeper about possible conditions. Software updates should add more features and insights over time.</p><p>The revamped 360 smart bed will be available in 2023. Pricing is expected to start at $1,099.</p><p>Sleep Number also announced some smart furniture that&#39;s designed to complement the bed.

Starting today, those in-app advertisements are starting to roll out. The company says its call-to-action (CTA) cards <a href="https://www.newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-06/spotify-introduces-call-to-action-cards-for-podcast-ads">will begin showing up</a> on its original and exclusive shows when the corresponding ad or offer is mentioned during an episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The new CTA cards will show up in the Spotify app as soon as the ad plays during a podcast on the player interface as well as on the show and episode pages. If you leave any of those places to do something else — like stream music, for example — the ads will display when you return back to that podcast in those three locations. Essentially, Spotify sees this as a way to not only relieve you have having to remember a promo code or specific URL, but it also argues you&#39;ll be able to interact with ads or brands you&#39;re interested in when you have the time to do so. There&#39;s no doubt a simple tap, if you&#39;re interested in what you&#39;ve just heard, is much more convenient than manually typing in the usual info. Of course, the downside is you&#39;ll now see ads in the app when listening to certain podcasts — even if you&#39;re a paid subscriber.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify doesn&#39;t see this as a potential issue, since even paid users hear ads on podcasts when listening to shows through its app. The advertisements keep podcasts afloat after all, and have turned the medium into a lucrative tool for businesses to promote goods and services. However, some might argue seeing an ad in the app and listening to one during a show are two very different things. Brands will probably be willing to jump on board quickly though since Spotify says the clickable ads have generated twice as many site visits during the early adoption phase than the &quot;traditional&quot; ad reads for companies like Ulta Beauty, Athletic Greens and Squarespace.</p><p>The CTA cards are powered by Spotify&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-spotify-podcast-ad-stats-sai.html">Streaming Ad Insertion</a>, a powerful analytics platform for podcast ads that automatically slots in pre-recorded promotional reads in the ideal spot for each listener. This is how the app knows when to begin showing the corresponding card for the ad when you hear it during a show. Of course, Spotify is promoting the CTA method as the first &quot;interactive&quot; podcast ads, and there&#39;s no doubt brands will be excited to have a more visible and, most importantly, clickable way to reach audiences. But it will be interesting to see how listeners respond to visual ads in their streaming app, especially those who pay a monthly premium so they don&#39;t have to hear them on non-podcast content.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-call-to-action-cards-podcast-ads-160009589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a365edf5-7824-4532-b16c-e22442e72a18</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641479552</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T14:32:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max are just $400 at Woot for Amazon Prime members]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a> might finally be within reach if you were waiting for them to reach a price threshhold.

When we last left the young crew of the <em>USS Protostar</em>, they had just left the Murder Planet and successfully fled the Diviner’s ship thanks to the activation of the ship’s secret experimental engine. Episode six, Kobayashi, picks up this thread, pushing the story… and possibly the timeline forward in some significant ways this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The title is a dead giveaway to one of the threads running through the episode, at least: “Kobayashi” is the name of the ship from the infamous “Kobayashi Maru” test (“Maru” means ship in Japanese). It’s basically a no-win scenario that cadets at Starfleet Academy are run through to test their readiness for command, except this time it’s self-proclaimed captain Dal in the big chair via a holodeck simulation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b25a2be0-6e6c-11ec-81ff-cea94c5ca9ba" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Brett Gray as Dal in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Aside from the absolute hilarity as Dal’s frustration mounts, it’s a pretty standard character study, designed to flesh out Dal and craft him more into the leader he wants to be.</p><p>There’s also some fan service here thanks to cameos from some favorite characters brought to life thanks to the wonders of CGI and well-chosen sound clips. As with Janeway, the show being animated keeps the older characters from having that creepy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-20-star-wars-rogue-one-cgi-actor.html"><em>Rogue One Princess Leia look</em></a>, but the audio samples could have used a lot more processing to have them match up. And why a show designed for newcomers needed this much fan service, I don’t know, but at least it’s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html"><em>Rise of Skywalker</em></a> bad.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c6fbb230-6e6c-11ec-bfee-019e5d750738" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Janeway has the files, except they’re classified and it’s up to Gwyn and Zero to try to open them up. And, though the initial reveal from them is a bit of a shocker (to be delved into next week), it’s the flashback sequence early in the episode that yielded the juiciest info for now.</p><p>We’re shown the Diviner 17 years earlier, in horrible health and already looking for the <em>USS Protostar</em>. He decides to create a “progeny,” in the hopes of continuing his race, even though it is against the rules. (Whose rules? That’s another unanswered question.) But the interesting reveal here is that the Diviner was already looking for the Protostar 17 years ago, suggesting that this series may not occupy the 2383 time frame we were given in press materials (though never mentioned on-screen).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe886e00-6e6c-11ec-baa3-fe2810ba79e3" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk, Brett Gray as Dal, Ella Purnell as Gwyn Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Even assuming the <em>Protostar</em> is built and launched in a year (which I doubt), <em>Prodigy</em> can’t take place any earlier than 2396, placing it firmly around the time of <em>Picard</em>, which is set in 2399. It’s possible that <em>Prodigy</em> is actually a few years later, however, making it the first Star Trek series set in the 25th century. Or the <em>Protostar</em> traveled through time, complicating things even further.</p><p>But assuming the time period is, in fact, the 25th century, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen the future of the Federation or Starfleet: <em>Discovery</em> is now set in the 32nd century, after all. But being much closer to the time period of earlier shows like <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and, of course, <em>Voyager</em> makes <em>Prodigy</em> more of a direct continuation of that era. The inclusion of Janeway as a training hologram already gave us a peek as the vaunted status the <em>Voyager </em>crew holds after their Delta Quadrant sojourn, but now the advanced tech seen in episode three “Starstruck” suddenly makes a lot more sense knowing it might be a few years… or decades since <em>Voyager</em>.</p><div id="aa466e8ad1ff497aa1446c179ed31d28"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8316X_cGYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>With the exception of <em>Picard</em>, the live-action shows have largely stayed away from the immediate future of the <em>TNG-DS9-Voyager</em> era, choosing instead to retread the 23rd century or even jump forward nearly a thousand years. It’s certainly odd given the popularity of those shows, but in leaving it be Paramount+ has left a lot of room for <em>Prodigy</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> to do something interesting there, experimenting with new genres while still appeasing hard-core fans. This may be the future we’ve been waiting to see on Star Trek.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-episode-six-140026030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc8d4063-e3f1-4fe2-9ef4-513873d1d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419343</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T21:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Angus Imrie as Zero, Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ Â©2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

It runs on an A14 Bionic chipset with a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU, and this particular model on sale has 64GB of storage and WiFi 6 capabilities. Apple refreshed the tablet&#39;s design to make it look more like the Pros, complete with flat edges, a USB-C port for charging and a lovely 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display. You won&#39;t get FaceID on this machine, but you will get TouchID thanks to the fingerprint reader on the device&#39;s power button.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Overall, we found the Air to be zippy both in performance and WiFi speeds, and its battery lasted up to 12.5 hours in our testing. While the latest iPad Pros are better if you&#39;re looking for a laptop replacement, you could use the Air as a 2-in-1 while on the go thanks to its compatibility with Apple&#39;s Magic Keyboard. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, allowing it to be a digital notebook for those that prefer writing things out by hand.</p><p>A discount like this is a good one to consider if you want an all-purpose tablet that&#39;s one step up from the base iPad.

Its original developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-15-torrent-front-end-popcorn-time-made-streaming-movies-free-and-ea.html">took the service down</a> and abandoned the project merely a few days after it launched in 2014. But since the project was open source, other developers were able pick up where they left off, and it&#39;s been killed and revived a few more times ever since. It remains to be seen whether Popcorn Time is now gone for good, but it looks like the biggest contributor to its most recent demise is the dwindling interest in the app.</p><p>On its website, the developers posted a graph of &quot;popcorn time&quot; searches over the past seven years. While   the app enjoyed a ton of searches in the months after its launch in 2015, the graph shows a sharp decline in interest by 2016. Its popularity continued to wane, and it never really recovered after that, at least based on Google Trends.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/popcorn-time-alternative-is-hard-to-find-as-app-shuts-down?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the group behind Popcorn Time announced its closure in an email. While they didn&#39;t say whether law enforcement action was a factor behind their decision to shut down the app this time around, Popcorn Time has had brushes with the law in the past. The original version may have closed after authorities got involved, and Hollywood studios even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-popcorn-time-hollywood-lawsuit.html">sued individual users</a> who allegedly downloaded and shared copies of movies illegally.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers associated with Popcorn Time previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-20-popcorn-time-p2p.html">talked about</a> how they&#39;re not responsible for piracy themselves, because the service doesn&#39;t actually host any content. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer sharing system and only provided a way for users to access content hosted on other people&#39;s computers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/movie-piracy-app-popcorn-time-shuts-down-115523694.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d05730b2-9427-4eac-99fd-d6d4cdb2cc4c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:55:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641467549</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T11:12:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[French regulator fines Google and Facebook a combined $238 million over cookies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>France&#39;s data regulator CNIL has <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">fined Google</a> €150 million ($170 million) and Meta/Facebook €60 million ($68 million) for violating EU privacy rules. Both companies failed to allow French users to easily reject cookie tracking technology as required by EU privacy rules, according to CNIL&#39;s news release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The fines were specifically levied against Google&#39;s US and Irish operations (€90 million and €60 million respectively) and against Facebook&#39;s Irish arm. Both companies face daily fines of €100,000 if they don&#39;t change their practices within three months of CNIL&#39;s official decision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>In addition to the fines, the restricted committee ordered the companies to provide Internet users located in France with a means of refusing cookies as simple as the existing means of accepting them, in order to guarantee their freedom of consent, within three months. If they fail to do so, the companies will have to pay a penalty of 100,000 euros per day of delay.</p></blockquote><p><em>&quot;</em>​​We are reviewing the authority&#39;s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-facebook-face-big-privacy-fines-in-france/"><em>Politico</em></a>. &quot;Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision under the ePrivacy Directive,&quot; a Google spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>CNIL said it has issued 100 orders and sanctions related to non-compliance with cookie legislation since it went into force on March 31, 2021. The regulator previously fined Google €100 million for cookie violations under European e-Privacy rules and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-france-fines-google-over-gdpr.html">€50 million</a> for GDPR violations.&nbsp;</p><p>Google is still fighting the €100 million fine before France&#39;s highest court. It&#39;s expected to fight the latest sanction as well, according <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-facebook-face-big-privacy-fines-in-france/"><em>Politico</em></a>. At the same time, the fines against Google and Meta&#39;s Irish operations point to major tension between the EU and Ireland. Europe sees Ireland&#39;s actions as too friendly toward tech giants headquartered there, and hostile toward user privacy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/france-cnil-facebook-google-cookies-fine-112543645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46bbd165-67e2-49ce-8b40-3accb7e77dcc</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:25:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641467334</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T11:09:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/f3b8c070-7999-11ea-9d9d-0d8bf585a053" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/f3b8c070-7999-11ea-9d9d-0d8bf585a053" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LIONEL BONAVENTURE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture taken on January 29, 2013 shows France's computer technology watchdog CNIL (Commisson Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes) sign in Paris.

Now, Nike has filed a lawsuit against the company over Mirror, accusing it of patent infringement. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-at-home-mirror-gym-and-fitness-apps.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-mirror-fitness-technology-11641429626"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Nike&#39;s lawsuit allege that Mirror — a full-size interactive mirror that brings a live fitness instructor into the user&#39;s home — and its apps use technologies that it invented and patented.&nbsp;</p><p>The sports apparel giant specifically mentioned that it filed a patent application in 1983 for a device that can prompt users to exercise, monitor their heart rate, determine their speed while running and the calories they burned. Nike also has a number of mobile apps for fitness, including the Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nike sent Lululemon a list of patents it allegedly infringed on back on November 3rd. As you&#39;d expect, the company more known for making yoga pants and other types of gym clothes disagreed with Nike&#39;s assessment. A spokesperson told the publications in a statement that the patents &quot;in question are overly broad and invalid.&quot; They also said that Lululemon is confident in its position and &quot;look forward to defending it in court.&quot;</p><p>Mirror operates as a standalone company within Lululemon, putting the workout clothes-maker in direct competition with the likes of Peloton and Tonal. Lululemon CEO Clavin McDonald previously <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-ceo-explains-why-it-bought-mirror-170336105.html">said</a> that the purchase was all about connecting with consumers, because they&#39;re bound to spend more the more they engage with the brand. Last month, however, the company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lululemon-slashes-sales-estimate-for-its-mirror-brand-growth-slows-2021-12">halved</a> its sales forecast for the device, calling 2021 &quot;a challenging year for digital fitness.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the only patent-related legal battle Lululemon is embroiled in. Last year, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/business/lululemon-peloton-lawsuit.html">filed</a> a patent infringement lawsuit of its own against Peloton, alleging that the design the other company used for a new line of leggings and sports bras infringe on its intellectual property.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nike-sues-lululemon-over-mirror-home-gym-081555042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47c94904-62ec-4217-af21-7f03767caff7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 08:15:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641456956</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T08:16:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lululemon/Mirror]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Facebook moderators can work from home following protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta&#39;s in-house staff won&#39;t have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-allows-return-to-office-deferrals-141013788.html">return to the office for months</a>, but some of its contracted workers are only now getting a similar reprieve. <em>BuzzFeed News</em> has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/facebook-moderators-who-were-ordered-back-to-the-office-can">learned</a> subcontractor Accenture has scrapped a requirement that hundreds of Facebook moderators return to in-person work in Mountain View, California on January 24th.

The moderators said it was impossible to maintain Accenture&#39;s social distancing requirements given tightly packed offices, closed stairwells, and poor enforcement, and that the company didn&#39;t provide exemptions for immunocompromised workers or vulnerable family members.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An Accenture spokesperson confirmed that moderators working from home &quot;should continue to do so&quot; based on COVID-19 health data, and claimed the company worked &quot;collaboratively&quot; to accommodate individuals in compliance with the law. Meta, meanwhile, said it would &quot;continue to prioritize&quot; the health and safety of all workers. Meta&#39;s own employees can defer returns to the office to as late as June.</p><p>These concerns aren&#39;t strictly new. Moderators accused Meta (then Facebook) in 2020 of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-coronavirus-protections-202420431.html">putting lives at risk</a> by asking some contractors to work from the office even when family members were highly vulnerable. Meta disputed some of the claims at the time, but not all.

The tech is different from your standard OLED in that it only uses blue organic light-emitting diodes. Those diodes then shine the light they produce through a series of quantum dots, allowing the panel to produce the full spectrum of color visible to the human eye. The approach has multiple advantages.</p><p>The most notable, particularly compared to current OLED displays, is that the panel can get a lot brighter. In a demo <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1641348163"><em><ins>FlatspanelsHD</ins></em></a> saw at CES, one display produced more than 1,000 nits of peak brightness across a 10 percent window. For comparison, some of the more recent TVs from LG can produce between 700 nits and 1,000 nits of brightness across the same area. Brightness is something LG has consistently tried to address with its WOLD panels. In December, the company’s display subsidiary unveiled its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html"><ins>OLED EX</ins></a>” tech, claiming it would enhance brightness by up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another advantage of the technology is better color performance. The panels Samsung Display showed off at CES 2022 covered 90 percent of the Rec. 2020 color gamut. LG’s WOLED panels, which people consistently praise for their accurate and vibrant colors, hit about 70 percent of the Rec. 2020 standard. Lastly, viewing angles are improved. In addition to TVs, the technology will make its way to gaming monitors, with Samsung and Dell planning to use the tech in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-quantum-dot-oled-gaming-monitor-160035802.html">34-inch displays</a>.</p><p>We’ll have to see how the panels perform in the real world, but at least on paper, QD-OLED could easily become the new standard for high-end consumer TVs. One of the first companies set to release a TV with a QD-OLED panel is Sony with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html"><ins>A95K</ins></a> sets. Unfortunately, Sony has yet to announce how much those TVs will cost, and we won’t know until closer to release sometime this spring.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d29de600-da31-496c-9f46-7d7b40360258</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:50:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419441</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:20:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch GM's Silverado EV reveal in 10 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="629f9bd2c57c4315a786deb0b6c210b9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNZR1ckXLlk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>GM had a lot to show off during its virtual CES 2022 keynote, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, which is built on the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery platform</a>.

They&#39;re organizing under the auspices of the Alphabet Workers Union, a year-old division of the Communication Workers of America which is seeking to represent employees and contractors at all level of Google&#39;s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>The 11 workers — 10 of whom have signed cards since the union drive began in October — are jointly employed by Google and a staffing agency called BDS Connected Solutions. That&#39;s not out of the ordinary, as staffing arrangements with Alphabet go: a 2019 story in the <em>New York Times</em> found temps and contractors made up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html">the majority</a> of the tech giant&#39;s workforce, while a <em>Recode</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/31/18644866/google-contractors-pay-ratings-glassdoor">report</a> that same year indicated that this second class of laborers earned significantly less than Google&#39;s own full-time employees. According to two BDS workers who spoke to Engadget, customer representatives had been feeling left out of key conversations about staffing and safety protocols, and communication with management has deteriorated.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We started off by just asking, &#39;Hey, how do you feel about this idea? Do you feel like you have enough say, in the conditions that you work in?&#39; We basically received a unanimous &#39;No, I don&#39;t feel like we do,&#39;&quot; Emrys Adair told Engadget. &quot;It hasn&#39;t always been like this,&quot; Mike Knox, who has been a Google Fiber representative for several years, said &quot;the general relationship between management and the workers. It used to be closer.&quot; Kansas City was the very <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-fiber-1-gigabit-internet-launches-in-kansas-city/">first market</a> Google Fiber launched in, nearly a decade ago.</p><p>What makes this push to form a bargaining unit somewhat unusual, however, has been the decision to skip straight to petitioning the National Labor Relations Board. Typically, this is the longer, more arduous option when an employer refuses to voluntarily recognize a union. But, according to Adair, Alphabet and BDS have neither attempted to quash the union drive, nor expressed a willingness to recognize it.&quot;There&#39;s been no acknowledgement, no pushback. no response at all yet,&quot; they said. Google and BDS have not responded to requests for comment from Engadget.</p><p>Like many workplaces in recent years, these service representatives have cycled through closures, reduced hours and the occasional need to isolate and work remotely when a colleague tests positive for COVID-19. While they weren&#39;t keen to give too many specifics as to what they&#39;d hope to secure in a first contract, one of the  benefits they&#39;re seeking to obtain is hazard pay. &quot;As far as the actual COVID precautions go, they&#39;ve done a pretty alright, job,&quot; Adair said. &quot;Our main concern is just that we&#39;re still working in the store in person in a pandemic, which in and of itself, no matter how you do that is a risk.&quot;</p><p>It may be months or years before the NLRB makes a ruling on these workers&#39; right to form a bargaining unit. In the meantime, Knox hopes it might spur action from others within Google Fiber. &quot;We&#39;re really hoping that this inspires in that regard,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re hoping that&#39;s a flashpoint where other people can see that and decide to push for more input.&quot;</p><p><em>Are you a Google employee, TVC or contractor?

The <a href="https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/ces/0105-cadillac-halo.html">InnerSpace concept </a>looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there&#39;s a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we&#39;ve ever seen. There&#39;s no steering wheel or pedals, of course. Instead, there&#39;s a built-in ottoman and a compartment for slippers and a blanket. Where GM&#39;s going, you won&#39;t need any sort of manual control.</p><div id="869d0e6dc9ec48289373dcd6b6579225"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBDJBKZg9iA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Even stepping into the car seems like something from science fiction: the doors pop out, while the large windshield/sunroof rises up. As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac&#39;s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it&#39;s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM&#39;s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.”</p><p>As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can&#39;t avoid it, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they&#39;ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-innerspace-autonomous-concept-car-201347425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bcca169-048b-4aa6-8396-c2bd55d7f184</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 20:13:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641413060</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T20:04:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cadillac expands its vision of personal autonomous future mobility with the InnerSpace concept â a dramatic, two-passenger electric and autonomous luxury vehicle.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cadillac Innerspace]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive reveals a VR wrist tracker for the Focus 3 headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC Vive" href="https://fave.co/3JJAKJk">HTC Vive</a> has revealed a wrist tracker for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">Focus 3 headset</a>. The device is 85 percent smaller and 50 percent lighter than the Vive Focus 3 controller.</p><p>The brand says the wearable can track your arm from fingertips to elbow. The Focus 3&#39;s cameras can monitor LEDs for standalone tracking. As such, attaching the Wrist Tracker to an object allows the headset to track it with six degrees of freedom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the help of high-frequency IMU (inertial measurement unit) data and an advanced kinematic model, Focus 3 will still know the exact position of your hand and wrist when the tracker isn&#39;t in the cameras&#39; line of sight. It can predict your pose too, so if you, for instance, reach behind your head with a tennis racket to play a smash shot, the headset should still have a good idea of what you&#39;re doing.</p><p>The Vive Wrist Tracker will be released in early 2022, starting in the US. It costs $129/€129/£119. HTC Vive also revealed new accessories for the Focus 3, including a multi battery charger and charging case, in part to reduce downtime between sessions.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-virtual-reality-wrist-tracker-focus-3-195333828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af0c1dad-2a31-4605-89fe-2dfbe1eda46b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:53:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641414711</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:21:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4c17c490-6e5e-11ec-8f2e-7bc65fa40e60" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4c17c490-6e5e-11ec-8f2e-7bc65fa40e60" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HTC Vive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person's arm wearing an HTC Vive Wrist Tracker.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Wrist Tracker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lyft and Kakao drivers can soon take ride requests through Android Auto]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many ride hailing drivers won&#39;t have to mount their phones in the near future.

At CES 2022, that technology finally made its way to the automotive industry as BMW unveiled an e-ink vehicle exterior that can change colors depending on weather and traffic conditions, or just the driver&#39;s mood.&nbsp;</p><p>In answer to your first question, no, this futuristic feature is nowhere near production ready despite appearing at the show on a live demonstration vehicle, dubbed the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The electrophoretic coloring material itself is applied as a vehicle body wrap but works just like it e-ink displays do in your Kindle. The wrap is embedded with millions of microcapsules each containing a negatively-charged white pigment and a positively charged-black pigment. Depending on the setting, applying an electrical charge to the material will cause either the white or black pigments to rise to the top of the microcapsule, changing the vehicle&#39;s color in moments.&nbsp;</p><p>While the current iteration can only swap between a pair of colors, the palette could eventually be expanded to display a rainbow&#39;s worth of differing shades. &quot;This gives the driver the freedom to express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they sit into their car,&quot; Stella Clarke, Head of Project for the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink, said in a prepared statement. &quot;Similar to fashion or the status ads on social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of different moods and circumstances in daily life.&quot;</p><p>E-ink exterior displays could also prove useful in more practical applications such as changing colors depending on the weather to increase a vehicle&#39;s battery life (and therefore, range) in cold climates or reduce the need for air conditioning in balmy weather.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30f802d9-7499-42bf-b31b-ca93337b734f</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641336068</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:21:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/052bdbe0-6da3-11ec-bf9f-aab4b9ca3980" width="2200" height="1238" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/052bdbe0-6da3-11ec-bf9f-aab4b9ca3980" width="2200" height="1238" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[the iFlow e-ink system from BMW]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[the iFlow e-ink system]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
