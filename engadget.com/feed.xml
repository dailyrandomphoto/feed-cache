To start with, the service will be available for free to GM employees and certain members of the public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Earlier this week, I requested a ride through our Cruise app and took several back-to-back rides in San Francisco — with no one else in the vehicle,&quot; Vogt wrote in a <a href="https://youtu.be/dmvZBiWYkFQ">YouTube video description</a>. &quot;There are lots of other Cruise employees (not just me) who are testing and refining the full customer experience as we take another major step toward the first commercial AV [ride hailing] product in a dense urban environment.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7ca78dbbfa1b45978473c453b709b782"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmvZBiWYkFQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Vogt said the Cruise launched the Bolt vehicles on Monday at 11PM, and it &quot;began to roam around the city, waiting for a ride request.&quot; He got his first ride from a Cruise Bolt EV called &quot;Sourdough,&quot; saying the experience was &quot;smooth.&quot; A <a href="https://youtu.be/svebS-uR7wc">separate video</a> showed sections before and after the vehicle picked up passengers while it was in &quot;ghost mode&quot; with no one in it.</p><p>Early last month, Cruise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-approval-driverless-rides-california-070950457.html">received</a> a California DMV permit to operate the service between the hours of 10PM and 6AM at a maximum speed of 30 MPH in mild weather conditions (no worse than light rain and fog). It&#39;s allowed to run them without drivers and charge for delivery services, but not ride-hailing. For paid robo-taxi rides, it must apply for a final permit with the California Public Utilities Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>GM recently launched its &quot;Ultra Cruise&quot; system for passenger vehicles, promising that it will &quot;ultimately enable hands-free driving in 95 percent of all driving scenarios.&quot; The company has spent 10 million miles testing the system, and its previous Super Cruise has generally garnered <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-cadillac-escalade-super-cruise-quick-drive-review/">positive</a> reviews <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/cadillac-super-cruise-is-as-good-or-better-than-tesla-autopilot/">compared to</a> rival systems like Tesla&#39;s Autopilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-cruise-is-now-offering-driverless-taxi-rides-in-san-francisco-103542426.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f938c21a-d77e-4a9c-b993-b632273f5216</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 10:35:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636020680</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T10:11:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f32a8e0-3d52-11ec-b7dd-743871b058c9" width="1122" height="676" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f32a8e0-3d52-11ec-b7dd-743871b058c9" width="1122" height="676" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cruise]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM's Cruise is now offering driverless taxi rides in San Francisco]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM's Cruise is now offering driverless taxi rides in San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto scammers stole $500K from wallets using targeted Google Ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scammers used a new type of phishing campaign, which doesn&#39;t use emails, to steal around $500,000 worth of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-073957132.html">cryptocurrency</a> from wallets this past weekend alone. According to <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</a>, those bad actors purchased Google Ads placements for their fraudulent websites that imitate popular wallets, such as Phantom App and MetaMask. The malicious websites have URLs close to the original&#39;s, such as &quot;phantonn.app&quot; — the real service&#39;s URL is &quot;phantom.app&quot; — with designs also copied from the real deal.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2ff746b0-3d52-11ec-ab77-c4a8cf26a68e" alt="Check Point Research" data-uuid="3e0272e4-9c50-3400-8018-d9d94e5b8a63"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Check Point Research</div></figure><p>The scammers will then steal the victim&#39;s passphrase if they visit the fake website and type it in. If the victim uses the fake website to create a new wallet, they will be given the attacker&#39;s secret recovery phrase. In the event that they use the recovery phrase to log in, they&#39;ll actually be logging into the bad actor&#39;s account, and any fund transferred to it will go to the scammer. For MetaMask, in particular, the fake website  has the option to import an existing wallet. Since doing so requires a seed phrase, the scammers will  also get access to it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Check Point Research explains, the Phantom App and MetaMask are some of the most popular wallets for Solana and Ethereum. It cross-referenced Reddit forums to come to the conclusion that around half a million dollars were stolen last weekend alone, and it found 11 compromised wallet accounts containing crypto worth between $1,000 and $10,000. The scammers had already withdrawn funds from those wallets before CPR found them.&nbsp;</p><p>CPR says scamming groups are now bidding on keywords on Google Ads, which is a testament to how effective the method is. It&#39;s now advising users to examine the wallet&#39;s URL closely and to skip Google Ads results altogether so as not to unknowingly fall for the scam.</p><div id="90e807589a25456ea04a57657e22d424"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRlgjBSQCw0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-google-ads-phishing-campaign-100044007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">789bde4d-583e-40f0-986a-9770f1b1cdcf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 10:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636020210</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T10:03:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[dulezidar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ljubljana, Slovenia - may 14 Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency close up shoot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Debt-laden FC Barcelona begins selling NFTs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-laliga-barcelona-real-madrid-tech.html">FC Barcelona</a>, one of football’s biggest clubs, is <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2328623/barca-and-ownix-join-forces-to-create-nfts-unique-digital-assets-bases-on-photos-and-videos-featuring-iconic-moments-from-the-clubs-history">auctioning off NFTs</a> “based on some of the club’s historic moments.” Details are scarce for now, but it appears as if the club will allow fans to bid on clips of highlights in a style similar to that of NBA Top Shot. The transactions will take place through <a href="https://ownix.com/">Ownix</a>, a new Ethereum-based marketplace which will offer auctions for digital trinkets in a variety of categories. The company says that the Barcelona NFTs will be selected by a “special joint committee” and then minted, first as unique one-off auctions, and then later as a broader limited edition or collection. Ownix, which is emerging from stealth with this announcement, currently has a fairly limited selection of items to purchase, including some <a href="https://ownix.com/auction/29-0"><em>Squid</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ownix.com/auction/30-0"><em>Game</em></a> and <a href="https://ownix.com/auction/27-0"><em>Batman</em>-themed</a> fan art, <a href="https://ownix.com/auction/24-0">plus whatever the hell this is</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Barcelona’s decision to begin selling NFTs may have been prompted by the debt crisis the club is currently in, with debts reported around $1.56 billion this summer. The club’s previous leadership is accused of reckless spending on a number of players on high wages that have subsequently underperformed. This summer, the club was forced into a fire sale and, due to rules on how big its wage bill could be, was unable to retain Lionel Messi, one of the world’s most successful players. That NFTs are, essentially, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">the definition of money for old rope</a>, means that it&#39;s the sort of financial opportunity a club like Barcelona are incapable of turning down right now.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The club isn&#39;t alone in leaping feet-first into the cryptocurrency mire, with many major names offering &quot;Fan Tokens&quot; through Socios. That company offers clubs the ability to mint their own coins and use it to run engagement schemes with their fans. But, unlike real socios — the Spanish word for the members who own a real ownership stake in their club — these tokens will only allow you to take part in polls set out by the club&#39;s leadership, enter competitions, and so on. But despite the obvious limitations, Socios is already making money, and when France&#39;s Paris Sant-Germain signed Lionel Messi, part of his &quot;welcome package&quot; was a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/lionel-messis-welcome-package-at-psg-includes-cryptocurrency-fan-tokens-12379687">bundle of these tokens</a>, believed to be worth (at the time) up to $34 million.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fc-barcelona-ownix-nfts-092038747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7abcc314-635f-44fb-9b08-211f2e968c96</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 09:20:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636017642</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T09:20:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54a6dad0-3c89-11ec-b3ff-69350949d3ae" width="3250" height="2167" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54a6dad0-3c89-11ec-b3ff-69350949d3ae" width="3250" height="2167" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BSR Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KIEV, UKRAINE - NOVEMBER 02: Frenkie de Jong of FC Barcelona celebrates his sides first goal during the Group E - UEFA Champions League match between Dinamo Kiev and FC Barcelona at the NSC Olimpiyskiy on November 2, 2021 in Kiev, Ukraine (Photo by Andrey Lukatsky/BSR Agency/Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dinamo Kiev v FC Barcelona - Group E - UEFA Champions League]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo lowers its Switch sales forecast due to global chip shortage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has cut its Switch sales forecast due to ongoing semiconductor shortages, the company announced in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211104_4e.pdf">earnings report</a>. It now expects to ship 24 million Switch units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 instead of the 25.5 million units it had originally predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue came into focus this quarter, as Nintendo managed to ship just 3.83 million Switch consoles compared to 6.86 million during the same quarter last year. So far, its net sales for the year are down 18.9 percent to 624.2 billion yen ($5.46 billion) year-over-year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That&#39;s not a huge surprise, however, as Switch and software sales exploded during the COVID-19 lockdown and following that has proved to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-2021-q1-financial-post-animal-crossing-slump-100125720.html">impossible</a> — particularly as chips and components have since become more scarce. Today&#39;s numbers don&#39;t include any sales of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html">Switch OLED</a>, as the earnings only provide data up to September 30th, a full week before the updated console arrived.</p><p>Despite the revised sales expectations, Nintendo expects to match total revenue of 1,600 billion yen ($14 billion) from the previous fiscal year, thanks in part to games. It aims to sell 200 million software units, 10 million more than last year, which would help offset the console sales drop. Upcoming titles include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-trailer-details-art-style-161620641.html"><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond </em>and<em> Shining Pearl</em></a> plus a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch</a>.</p><p>The most popular games so far this fiscal year include <em>Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> (3.6 million units sold), <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> (3.34 million units) and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> (2.22 million units). The launch of <em>Metroid Dread</em> came after the earnings period Nintendo is reporting today.</p><p>Despite the reduced expectations and tepid console sales this quarter, Nintendo has now sold 92.87 million Switch units to date. That&#39;s still short of the Wii, which has the company&#39;s current home console sales record of 101.63 million units shipped. However, if Nintendo comes close to matching the 11.57 million units sold during last year&#39;s holiday period, the Switch — aided by the new Switch OLED model — could finally top that mark by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lowers-its-switch-sales-forecast-due-to-global-chip-shortage-083924964.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0399fd90-d130-4575-a6d2-44ccbc4d8ead</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 08:39:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636017170</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T09:12:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/014bdef0-3d45-11ec-a7dd-edc0e14d97fe" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/014bdef0-3d45-11ec-a7dd-edc0e14d97fe" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo reduces its Switch sales forecast due to chip shortages]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo reduces its Switch sales forecast due to chip shortages]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo releases big 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' update earlier than expected]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has released its last free major content update for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-175925109.html"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> over a day earlier than planned. During its Direct <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html">presentation</a> in October, the gaming giant announced that it&#39;s rolling out <a href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/news/#!/animal-crossing-new-horizons-expands-into-new-waters-with-a-free-update-and-paid-expansion-on-nov-5"><em>New Horizons version 2.0</em></a> on November 5th. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nintendo-animal-crossing-early-update/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> and <a href="https://sea.ign.com/animal-crossing-switch/178498/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-version-20-update-is-live-early"><em>IGN</em></a> have confirmed, though, the update is now live and can be downloaded to your Switch. Version 2.0 adds quite a number of new features to the game, including characters from old <em>Animal Crossing</em> titles.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those characters is Brewster, the quiet pigeon proprietor who&#39;ll open up the Roost café at the museum after you do a certain favor for museum director Blathers. Kapp&#39;n, the singing sailor kappa, is also back and will take you to remote islands on his boat. You can only purchase boat rides once a day with Nook Miles, though, so you can&#39;t endlessly sail around all day. If you want to shop from new stores owned by familiar characters, you can head over to Harv&#39;s Island, which now has an open market. Reese &amp; Cyrus&#39; shop, for instance, will offer new types of furniture customization, while Katrina will read your fortune.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update adds gyroid hunting and cooking activities, as well. For the latter, which will be part of DIY recipes, you can combine anything you harvest and other ingredients to create new dishes. Finally, <em>New Horizons</em> 2.0 introduces several quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to establish ordinances. You can make the residents get up at the time of the day you&#39;re active in the game, for example, or reduce weeds&#39; growing rate. The update also allows you to keep more items by giving you a bigger home storage and storage sheds you can place around your island.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the free update, Nintendo announced last month that it&#39;s releasing a <em>Happy Home Paradise </em>paid DLC that&#39;ll let you design vacation homes for characters on November 5th. That one isn&#39;t available yet, but it&#39;ll set you back $25 when it comes out tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-version-2-080043672.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b5c1755-cc1f-469f-b10d-4a613ee35e72</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 08:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636012828</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T08:00:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bcbcb340-3d3f-11ec-af3b-0fa997d8937e" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bcbcb340-3d3f-11ec-af3b-0fa997d8937e" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max and Discovery+ might merge into a single platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in May, AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-spins-off-warner-media-in-a-merger-deal-with-discovery-123716979.html">spun off</a> its WarnerMedia division and merged it with Discovery in a $43 billion agreement.

Discovery (as the merged company will be called) may offer HBO Max and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discovery-plus-now-available-roku-amazon-fire-181032400.html">Discovery+</a> as a bundle. In the next phase of the plan, the company may merge the two streaming services into one platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/discovery-hbo-max-may-bundle-combining-after-merger"><em>FierceVideo</em></a> said Perette described both streaming services as an &quot;incredibly attractive tech buffet.&quot; He expects the new company to take the best parts from both to create a new platform, as there will be &quot;meaningful cost savings&quot; and &quot;meaningful consumer benefits&quot; from combining the two services,</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav also <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-max-subscribers-discovery-plus-warner-bros-merger/">revealed</a> during the earnings call that less than half of Discovery+ subscribers in the US are also subscribed to HBO Max. He said that with the right packaging, the fact that the overlap in subscribers isn&#39;t too big &quot;provides a real opportunity to broaden the base of [the] combined offering.&quot;</p><p>When and where the joint HBO Max and Discovery+ service will initially be available remains to  be seen. Discovery said it might be easier for the company to combine its streaming service with HBO Max in regions where Discovery+ isn&#39;t available yet. At the moment, it&#39;s being very selective when it comes to rolling out Discovery+ to new markets to minimize the need to re-platform two streaming services in the future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-discovery-merge-single-platform-061538436.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c4532af-cb2f-43bb-9aed-0552dfd5d90c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 06:15:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636006524</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T06:15:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/beeb4c70-bc71-11eb-b3db-2aba3c3ff686" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/beeb4c70-bc71-11eb-b3db-2aba3c3ff686" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/05/23: In this photo illustration the AT&T logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen with the Discovery and WarnerMedia logos in the background.

According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/technology/google-pentagon-artificial-intelligence.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, the company is “aggressively” pursuing the Defense Department’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability cloud contract. A Google spokesperson confirmed to Engadget it was pursuing a bid.</p><p>Announced at the start of July, the program is a replacement for the military’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html"><ins>cancelled $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure</ins></a> initiative. With JEDI, the Pentagon had planned to modernize its IT infrastructure with help from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-jedi-dod-azure.html"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a>. However, the contract stalled after Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html"><ins>challenged it in court</ins></a>, in part over allegations former President Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html"><ins>interfered with the evaluation process</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike JEDI, JWCC is a multi-vendor contract that will see the military eventually working with more than one company. When the Pentagon announced the program, it said it would collect proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft. At the time, it said they were the two vendors best suited to meet its needs, but noted it was also open to working with other companies. Google did not bid on JEDI in part because of what happened with Project Maven.</p><p>The program, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-06-google-is-helping-us-military-train-ai-to-study-drone-footage.html"><ins>with help from Google</ins></a>, saw the military use machine learning to interpret drone footage. When the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-06-google-is-helping-us-military-train-ai-to-study-drone-footage.html"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> its involvement in Maven, it said its technology was involved in “non-offensive uses only,” and that it was flagging material for “human review.” Outrage within the company quickly grew. Approximately 4,000 employees petitioned Google CEO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-04-google-employees-petition-ceo-to-drop-out-of-pentagon-ai-project.html"><ins>Sundar Pichai</ins></a> to pull the company out of the project. Some workers even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-14-google-project-maven-employee-protest.html"><ins>left Google over the episode</ins></a>. In the aftermath of the protest, the company did not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-01-google-will-not-renew-military-ai-contract-project-maven.html"><ins>renew its contract</ins></a> with the Pentagon.</p><p>It also established a set of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-30-google-military-ai-guided-by-ethical-principles.html"><ins>ethical principles</ins></a> to guide its military AI work. Those <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__ai.google_principles_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=yIKn3dr03T860uJ5xTuM701cyo36v50Ry2mCT2ubPVc&amp;m=SeuhbFvZ7eqiEibt1wR73qCZG5jPkYQTuwczAkzDaXI&amp;s=0K4nvsAP8R9Ylnu9EqHo00H8XshjNj4F-YtiaR165_s&amp;e="><ins>guidelines</ins></a> prohibit the company from using machine learning in relation to “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.” When Google established the principles, Pichai reportedly told workers his hope was they would stand “the test of time.”</p><p>In spite of those guidelines, Google is pursuing the JWCC contract. According to <em>The Times</em>, the company has “raced” to prepare a proposal to present to Pentagon officials on why it should be involved in the project. The contract is reportedly a priority for the company, with the outlet reporting that Google pulled employees off other assignments to work on its bid.&nbsp;</p><p>“We strongly believe a multi-cloud strategy offers the department the best solution today and in the future,” a spokesperson for the company said. “We are firmly committed to serving our public sector customers, including the DoD, Department of Energy, NIH, and many other government agencies, and we will evaluate any future bid opportunities accordingly.&quot;</p><p>Google will reportedly find out if it qualifies to make a bid sometime in the next few weeks. The question then becomes if the contract is compatible with its AI guidelines, and what effect that will have on its employees. Those principles leave room for it to work with the military on projects that involve things like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0520/defense-innovation-unit">cybersecurity</a>, and it already has contracts in place to help the Defense Department with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/1208/defenseinnovationunit">pilot training</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2020/0827/corrosiondetectionfornavy">Navy ship maintenance</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If it obtains the contract, Engadget has learned the company anticipates it could help the Defense Department with cloud services like hosting, storage and networking, in addition to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, the Pentagon could use Google&#39;s data analytics capabilities to predict and monitor forces like climate change and the current pandemic. Any custom AI work the job involves will need to be vetted through the company&#39;s guidelines. It also expects it could work with the Pentagon on more prosaic issues like security, employee travel and finance.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-jwcc-contract-214046745.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17a78586-7bd5-42f9-8350-24fb180146d1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 21:40:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635976471</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T21:54:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a7a8b220-3ce9-11ec-bfb7-aa1db157bdf4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a7a8b220-3ce9-11ec-bfb7-aa1db157bdf4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kiyoshi Tanno via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of the Department of Defense, the cornerstone of United States defense.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[American City Aerial / Department of Defense (Pentagon)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's latest patch hints at cloud-synced driver profiles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is preparing for a world where your driver profile can follow you across different cars, be it your personal EV or a rental. The car maker has added a Cloud Profiles section in its latest software release, which points to an &quot;Enable Vehicle Sync&quot; option for backing up driver profiles, <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/626/exclusive-tesla-adding-vehicle-sync-feature-to-driver-profiles"><em>Tesla Software Updates reports</em></a>. The news isn&#39;t a huge surprise, as Elon Musk previously said <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/72/tesla-to-add-driver-profiles-to-the-cloud-giving-you-the-ability-to-use-your-profile-on-any-vehicle">cloud-synced profiles</a> were on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>For a tech-focused car company like Tesla, giving its customers a simple way to bring their settings to multiple vehicles simply makes sense. That&#39;s particularly true after Hertz announced it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">would be buying 100,000 Teslas</a> for its rental fleet. Though Musk was quick to point out that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html">order hasn&#39;t been placed yet</a>, it&#39;s not hard to imagine a world where anyone can easily rent a Tesla. They&#39;d be easier to maintain than gas-powered cars, and the Model 3 is already cheaper than many luxury vehicles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And sure, for the truly privileged, cloud profiles could also make it easier to synchronize settings across multiple vehicles. According to <em>Tesla Software Updates</em>, synced settings include your display brightness, Autopilot and navigation options. It&#39;d also be helpful to have your Stopping Mode synchronized, as that seriously changes how Tesla&#39;s braking functions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-driver-cloud-sync-update-211525117.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">093153c7-9a34-4eef-8ea7-8871c238acad</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 21:15:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635972938</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T20:55:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - OCTOBER 17, 2021 - A Tesla Model 3 is displayed at the Tesla Experience store in Joy City, Yantai, East China's Shandong Province, Oct 17, 2021.

The FCC has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-authorizes-boeings-broadband-satellite-constellation">authorized</a> Boeing&#39;s application to launch a satellite broadband constellation. The network would serve home, business and government customers in the US and worldwide. The satellites would sit talk to each other as well as the ground, although the FCC rejected Boeing&#39;s bid to use certain frequencies for satellite-to-satellite chatter.</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t said when its satellite network would launch or what capabilities it would offer. Boeing would operate at much higher altitudes than SpaceX&#39;s Starlink, however. The majority of the constellation, 132 low Earth orbit satellites would fly at an altitude of 656 miles. A batch of 15 non-geostationary orbit satellites, meanwhile, would operate between 17,000 and 27,500 miles. Starlink operates at altitudes between 215 and 350 miles. That might increase lag, although real-world performance might vary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The project has been in development for a long time. <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-telecom-regulator-circulates-boeing-satellite-plan-approval-2021-10-08/">notes</a> Boeing first asked for approval back in 2017.

All the same, it&#39;s easy to see Boeing remaining patient.

There&#39;s also the simple matter of jumping into the satellite internet field before it&#39;s too late. Amazon, SpaceX, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneweb-softbank-investment-175824581.html">OneWeb</a> and others are either launching satellites or have clear plans.

The biggest move is that it&#39;s transitioning from an open platform to a closed one, with the goal of eventually vetting every campaign before it goes live. <a href="https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2021/11/10-years-1-takeaway-community-trust.html"><ins>In a blog post</ins></a>, Indiegogo&#39;s vice president of product and customer trust Will Haines noted that when the company started in 2008, the idea was to let anyone raise money for just about any purpose with few restrictions.</p><p>&quot;However, I’ve learned that &#39;open&#39; is not what our community wants,&quot; Haines wrote. &quot;Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap in the dark. And it certainly can’t be scamming. Our community of backers is the reason that anything happens on Indiegogo, and they are counting on the platform to be a safe, trusted space to engage with innovation.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, Indiegogo will scrutinize projects more closely before those seeking funding can push their campaigns live. Under what the company is calling <a href="https://entrepreneur.indiegogo.com/the-guidepost-program/">The Guidepost Program</a>, Indiegogo will do more to ensure that projects have a viable plan to follow through and fulfill their rewards.</p><p>Haines stressed that Indiegogo can&#39;t guarantee every campaign will deliver on its promises, but it &quot;can protect backers from unfeasible projects and outright scams. We now have the resources and expertise to apply this level of scrutiny to all of our largest campaigns and will expand it to every campaign moving forward.&quot;</p><p>Indiegogo has expanded its trust and safety team to help it screen campaigns, and it formed a review board to oversee the riskiest campaigns and the &quot;most impactful&quot; decisions made by the trust team. In addition, the company has teamed up with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gofundme/">GoFundMe</a> to create the <a href="https://entrepreneur.indiegogo.com/crowdfunding-trust-alliance/">Crowdfunding Trust Alliance</a>. The group&#39;s goal is to share best practices and discuss industry trends, and it aims to enlist other reputable crowdfunding platforms.</p><p>One feature that&#39;s on the way to Indiegogo is the Trust Loyalty Program. This will highlight campaigns from creators who have run successful projects in the past. Haines wrote that Indiegogo will &quot;tailor our vetting to match the historical risk level of these entrepreneurs.&quot;</p><p>There have been many crowdfunding-related scams and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-ftc-investigates-700000-crowdfunding-campaign.html"><ins>allegations</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-06-ftc-lawsuit-ibackpack-fraud-indiegogo-kickstarter-crowdfunding.html"><ins>of fraud</ins></a> over the years, as well as campaigns for products that don&#39;t seem to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-30-arubixs-indiegogo-hoax.html"><ins>pass the smell test</ins></a>. It&#39;s likely a net positive that Indiegogo is getting more serious about screening campaigns, even if some legitimate projects might fall through the cracks. In any case, it&#39;s still wise to exercise caution whenever you consider contributing to a campaign, since there&#39;s always going to be at least <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-07-indiegogo-requires-campaigns-disclose-product-status-risk.html">a little risk</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/indiegogo-closed-platform-crowdfunding-campaign-screen-165238148.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0c6eeb75-c386-4a07-8f1f-f2aa4bb3f7a8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635958362</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T16:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/f267f5e0-ad80-11ea-b5d7-547e496ead61" width="5056" height="3414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/f267f5e0-ad80-11ea-b5d7-547e496ead61" width="5056" height="3414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Prostock-Studio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Togetherness concept.

The Chromium-based browser is available either through Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">website</a> (in .deb and .rpm formats) or through the command line using a Linux package manager.</p><p>The Linux version has been a long time in coming. Microsoft was testing the Edge variant in its Dev and Beta channels for about a year, and it&#39;s arriving more than two years after the Mac and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-chromium-edge-browser-release-date.html">Windows versions</a>. It&#39;s not clear what prompted the wait, although Linux has historically had little consumer PC market share.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature parity is largely intact, at least. You unsurprisingly won&#39;t find an Internet Explorer compatibility mode (only Windows has that), but you can sync tabs, bookmarks, passwords and extensions. This may be your browser of choice if you use Linux on a personal system but want the browser setup from your Windows PC at work.</p><p>The release is symbolic of how Microsoft&#39;s relationship with Linux has changed over the years. The company was notoriously antagonistic in the early 2000s, when CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux &quot;a cancer&quot; on intellectual property and otherwise treated it as a threat to Windows. Internet Explorer effectively served as a deterrent to would-be Linux switchers as many IE-optimized sites wouldn&#39;t run properly on Linux browsers without significant effort, if they ran at all.</p><p>Flash forward two decades and it&#39;s a different story. The company is now much more focused on services than Windows, and that means making offerings like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-available-worldwide-164731336.html">Microsoft 365</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-365-cloud-virtual-pc-150022333.html">Windows 365</a> as accessible as possible. Microsoft needs to be friendly to Linux users to keep them from using rivals like Google Workspace — Edge for Linux could be worthwhile if it leads to years of subscription fees, even if users have no plans to switch to Windows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-linux-stable-release-161545904.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5a8f443-62a3-4626-bac4-3ece9719d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:15:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635955136</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T15:58:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' Vivobook Slate is a 2-in-1 laptop with an OLED display for $600]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/asus/">ASUS</a> is preparing to ship what it claims is the first 13.3-inch Windows 2-in-1 laptop with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oled/"><ins>OLED</ins></a> screen.

In fact, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-preview-e3-130020326.html"><em>Metroid Dread is the first all-new game</em></a> in the series since the divisive <em>Metroid:</em><em>Other M </em>arrived in 2010. As the fifth mainline, side-scrolling game in the series, <em>Dread</em> has a lot to live up to. And while it’s not a total reinvention of the franchise, like <em>Metroid Prime</em> was 19 years ago, it also does a great job of avoiding the pitfall of feeling like a retread, an issue that occasionally plagues Nintendo’s other flagship franchises.</p><p>If you’ve played any of the previous side-scrolling Metroid games, <em>Dread </em>will be familiar. As usual, Samus Aran loses all her powers and needs to escape an underworld maze, fighting baddies and retrieving power-ups that let you explore new sections (or old parts of the map you couldn’t get through before).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11701b3fccf940bc96696126b644aa5c"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>That’s a well-trodden path, but Nintendo flipped things this time with the E.M.M.I. encounters, terrifying robotic enemies that stalk you through specific parts of the map. They can’t be killed until you explore their area to find a weapon power-up that puts you on equal footing. At first, I was worried that these encounters would be too frequent, or too hard to escape, but developer MercurySteam did an excellent job balancing out the E.M.M.I. areas. Escaping from the dreaded robots by leaving the zones they patrol isn’t too tough, and you don’t have to spend <em>so </em>long in their areas that the whole game devolves into stealth tension.</p><p>On the other hand, if you get caught by an E.M.M.I., that’s pretty much it. You have one chance to block their lethal attack, and I’ve only done it right once. I’ve probably gotten caught several dozen times and have never made it out alive. Fortunately, the game just resets you to the door entering the E.M.M.I. zone if you fail, so you won’t lose much progress.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4e594c0-3cb3-11ec-bf2b-54560b27f0f5" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Metroid Dread" data-uuid="114d91d1-6953-35fb-b3c0-98cd07601d3e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, I’ve had a blast exploring the dank tunnels and caverns that make up the world of <em>Dread. </em>As with most Nintendo games, the atmosphere and art style are top-notch, even if <em>Dread</em> doesn’t hold a candle to the more technologically advanced titles on the Xbox Series X or PS5. When I play a game that is this well-designed and thoughtful about what it does with the technology available to it, I don’t worry about counting pixels. That said, it also looks extremely impressive docked to my 4K TV.</p><p>Most of the gameplay hallmarks of Metroid titles are here, including power-ups like charged shots, the morph ball, the missile cannon and plenty of other returning favorites. But there’s enough new here, like the grapple beam and screw attack, to keep the game feeling fresh.</p><p>Maybe for people who have obsessively played the Metroid series before, <em>Dread </em>will feel like more of a retread. But while I’m familiar with the core components of these games, the first-person <em>Metroid Prime</em> is the game I know the best — I never beat the original game, or the highly-regarded <em>Super Metroid</em> on the Super NES. If you’re like me, don’t let that stop you from trying <em>Metroid Dread</em>. There’s a reason so-called Metroidvania games are still popular.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you haven’t tried one before, getting the newest installment in the series that helped define the genre is a great way to get your feet wet. Most importantly, it doesn’t feel like MercurySteam and Nintendo just checked the boxes for this game. Indeed, the skill that MercurySteam brought to <em>Samus Returns</em> (a remake of 1991’s <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus</em> for the Game Boy) is on display here; Nintendo definitely picked the right developer to make the first mainline Metroid game since 2002. It’s an inspired addition to a series that already has an impressive legacy. Just don’t get cocky — run like hell if an E.M.M.I. tracks you down.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-is-a-nintendo-essential-151014629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5479586-5147-44de-8b89-c6b8f31f0a61</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 15:10:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635951570</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T14:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9e3bf780-3cb5-11ec-b8db-0c85ec70153b" width="2500" height="1517" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9e3bf780-3cb5-11ec-b8db-0c85ec70153b" width="2500" height="1517" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/edddd960-3cb1-11ec-9efd-cd7cb1062cde" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[3]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US bans trade with security firm NSO Group over Pegasus spyware (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Surveillance software developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html">NSO Group</a> may have a very tough road ahead. The US Commerce Department has added NSO to its Entity List, effectively banning trade with the firm. The move bars American companies from doing business with NSO unless they receive explicit permission. That&#39;s unlikely, too, when the rule doesn&#39;t allow license exceptions for exports and the US will default to rejecting reviews.</p><p>NSO and fellow Israeli company Candiru (also on the Entity List) face accusations of enabling hostile spying by authoritarian governments. They&#39;ve allegedly supplied spyware like NSO&#39;s Pegasus to &quot;authoritarian governments&quot; that used the tools to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">track activists, journalists</a> and other critics in a bid to crush political dissent. This is part of the Biden-Harris administration&#39;s push to make human rights &quot;the center&quot; of American foreign policy, the Commerce Department said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest round of trade bans also affects Russian company Positive Technologies and Singapore&#39;s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy, bot of which were accused of peddling hacking tools.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked NSO Group for comment, although its official media contact address produced an error. The company has strongly rejected claims of enabling abuses in the past, including denials that Pegasus was used to target murdered journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. NSO said it had blocked access for previous abuses, and it even hired a libel attorney who accused investigative journalists and their partners of misinterpretation and making unfounded assumptions.</p><p>The Commerce Department claims to have evidence of NSO&#39;s actions, though. The net effect is the same. NSO isn&#39;t necessarily doomed. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-expands-huawei-trade-restrictions-140237627.html">blocklist member Huawei</a>, though, it may struggle to operate without access to any American partners it used before.</p><p><strong>Update 11/3 12PM ET:</strong> An NSO Group spokesperson told Engadget the company was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the decision, and claimed its tools helped the US by &quot;preventing terrorism and crime.&quot; NSO said it would call for a reversal of the ban and reiterated claims it had the &quot;world’s most rigorous&quot; human rights and compliance systems. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world’s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-trade-ban-nso-group-145347522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">39548dc9-7d6a-42a5-ad95-0722ef36360d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:53:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635955764</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T16:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e15b4080-3caf-11ec-bded-cfe17379e28f" width="8066" height="5378" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e15b4080-3caf-11ec-bded-cfe17379e28f" width="8066" height="5378" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amir Cohen / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man walks past the logo of Israeli cyber firm NSO Group at one of its branches in the Arava Desert, southern Israel July 22, 2021.

It all adds to a bunch of silly fun that anyone aged eight and up can partake in.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.target.com/Ao3QdD" id="a6ee6e5bbbb44c09a94d11ea65c81bb4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Target;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Space Invaders at Target - $20</a><h2>Summer Camp</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19756c10-3cac-11ec-bfbd-806e7772324f" alt="The  Summer Camp board game for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="2885f251-7517-3979-b1da-9be20b016afa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Buffalo Games</div></figure><p>Another excellent family game is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Summer Camp" href="https://goto.target.com/BXy9N4">Summer Camp</a>, which will have your loved ones recalling fond memories of canoeing, making friendship bracelets and roasting marshmallows.

Ford has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html">introduced</a> an F-100 Eluminator concept that upgrades the circa-1978 pickup truck with two of the company&#39;s new Eluminator electric crate motor kit. The powerplants, taken from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html">Mustang Mach-E GT</a> Performance Edition, give the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#39;t discuss performance benchmarks or range, but it&#39;s safe to presume you could smoke some sports cars with that kind of power.</p><p>The truck has more customizations beyond the EV motors, including the vertical center-stack touchscreen from the Mach-E. You&#39;ll also see custom aluminum Forgeline wheels, a billet aluminum dash from JJR Fabrication and avocado-tanned leather from MDM Upholstery. This may look like a classic truck, but it&#39;s not appointed like one.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can&#39;t buy this concept, as you might have guessed. Instead, Ford would rather you buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries, controllers and traction inverters. You&#39;d only want to buy the motor right now if you have the resources to complete the rest of the puzzle yourself. This does, however, hint at a future where many beloved combustion engine cars can get a second life through an EV transplant.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1aab210-3cad-11ec-af5c-53f4f2d5d505" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="F-100 Eluminator concept truck interior" data-uuid="9918c78d-f734-34e7-ad7b-5003be09c21c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ford</div></figure>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9c24160-8b84-4f38-8ce7-c3187763e78a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:05:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635947820</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T13:57:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa-powered indoor air quality monitor alerts you to pollution]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon still isn&#39;t done announcing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html">Alexa-powered smart home gadgets</a> this year.

However, Waymo clearly hopes to use this knowledge for its long-term autonomy goals in various cities.</p><p>The rollout will focus on Manhattan below Central Park (aka midtown and lower Manhattan), including the financial district and a portion of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. All tests will operate during daylight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The dry run will help Waymo&#39;s Driver AI cope with New York City&#39;s notoriously heavy traffic, of course, but the company is particularly interested in weather testing. Like many northern cities, NYC has its fair share of ice and snow, both of which remain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-08-waymo-snow-navigation.html">huge challenges for driverless cars</a>. This test will give Waymo further opportunities to test its navigation in winter conditions, not to mention the heavy rainfall more common in the region.</p><p>Waymo said it was &quot;encouraged&quot; by the responses from politicians, regulators, industry and non-profits. With that said, it&#39;s easy to see the potential for a backlash. NYC has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">highly protective of its taxi business</a> at times, and is heavily dependent on ridesharing. While fully driverless ride hailing services like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-phoenix-public-193945960.html">Waymo One</a> may not arrive for a long time in the city, taxi and rideshare operators alike likely won&#39;t be thrilled at the prospect of being replaced by autonomous systems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f025f4b-12e3-4d4a-b32c-fd4fdc9aed08</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635951108</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T14:52:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a2fefa0-3c1b-11ec-bfeb-09e0beaa0f08" width="5287" height="2974" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a2fefa0-3c1b-11ec-bfeb-09e0beaa0f08" width="5287" height="2974" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[March 2, 2020 Mountain View / CA / USA - Waymo self driving car performing tests on a street near Google's offices, Silicon Valley; Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is developing an autonomous car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Waymo self driving car performing tests on a street near Google's offices]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
