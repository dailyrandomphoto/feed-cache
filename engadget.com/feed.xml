The headline feature is a carousel that shows local news in response to search queries, launching around the world in all languages starting today. Google initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-21-google-coronavirus-search-hub.html">launched</a> the feature to provide local information for COVID searches, but it&#39;s now been expanded to other topics like sports, local government and more.</p><p>Google said it&#39;s been tweaking its systems so that authoritative, relevant local news sources appear more often next to national publications in Top Stories and other general news features. &quot;This improvement ensures people will see authoritative local stories when they’re searching for news, helping both the brand and the content of news publishers reach more people,&quot; Google said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also able to drill down into narrow subtopics related to local news, like high school football. Combined with its location services (provided you have those enabled), you should get more relevant results. &quot;For example, if you’re in Detroit and search for football, we’ll now show you results for local high school and college teams, rather than just showing you results for, say, the professional team,&quot; Google said. It will also surface tweets from news organization along with &quot;authoritative sources and authors.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ad6e3f0-46d6-11ec-b7b0-b4f76d9be602" alt="Google launches new features to support local news organizations" data-uuid="14b195a2-c8e6-30f8-af3c-158ee9f837b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Alongside the new consumer features, Google announced new data tools for reporters. First up is the Census Mapper project, a map that can be embedded in stories to display Census data at the national, state and county level. It was produced as part of the 2020 Census Co-op, supported the Google News Initiative. It can show Census data at a local level, showing how populations have shifted over time. Google is also improving its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-journalist-studio-pinpoint-110047367.html">Common Knowledge Project</a>, a visual journalism project that allows reporters to explore local data.&nbsp;</p><p>The new features might be cold comfort to the many local newspapers and websites that have been <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-24/local-newspapers-dying-ways-to-save-them">gone out of business</a> in part due to the flow of ad dollars to companies like Facebook and Google. Both of those tech giants have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-facebook-invest-local-newsrooms.html">put in some funds</a> to support local journalism, but that has done little to stop the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/reader-center/local-news-deserts.html">decline</a> of newspapers that perform a valuable service in their communities.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-launches-new-features-to-support-local-news-organizations-152504647.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d661acc5-7767-4637-ae43-441078dadf49</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:25:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637075717</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T15:15:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is seen at the entrance to the Google retail store in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

A <a href="https://png.sainsburys.co.uk/">website</a> for the upcoming SmartShop Pick &amp; Go store only mentioned the technology coming from a &quot;third-party supplier,&quot; but <em>Bloomberg</em> sources said Amazon was responsible.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment. A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson wouldn&#39;t confirm or deny Amazon&#39;s involvement, but did say it was testing an &quot;upgraded version&quot; of SmartShop with employees in a Holborn store. The shop is believed to be opening to the public on November 29th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hardware certainly appears to be Amazon&#39;s, if <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s visit to the store was any indication. Customers scan their phones on the way in, and ceiling-mounted cameras use AI to detect what they take from shelves. You&#39;re charged as soon as you leave the store.</p><p>Sainsbury&#39;s has a few incentives to adopt Just Walk Out. While the UK has relaxed many of its pandemic measures, this could be appealing to customers who still want to avoid contact with staff and often-touched self-checkout kiosks. The faster turnarounds could lead to more customers even without safety concerns. And then there&#39;s competition — Tesco recently opened a nearby Express store using rival technology from Trigo Vision. Sainsbury&#39;s risks losing business from time-conscious shoppers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">828e2255-d2c7-4a5a-8c04-c831c733cc56</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:10:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637075018</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T15:03:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/74a6c1e0-46ea-11ec-9c9f-e1c84dc77e48" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/74a6c1e0-46ea-11ec-9c9f-e1c84dc77e48" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2020/11/05: A man wearing a face mask walks past the Sainsburys shop in Holborn, London as Sainsbury's announce they are to cut 3,500 jobs and close 420 Argos stores.

Food Scan is the latest addition to the app’s “scan” functionality, which also allows users to identify plants and dog breeds and items of clothing.</p><p>Now, scanning a food will turn up recipes containing the item, as well as a link to the Wikipedia entry for the ingredient. Snap has partnered with allrecipes.com on the feature, which it says can recognize more than 1,200 items and suggest more than 4,500 dishes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I got the chance to preview the feature, and the app’s food scanning abilities were mostly spot-on. It was able to correctly identify a variety of produce and recommend relevant recipes (including a persimmon bar recipe that looked intriguing). Like most of these types of visual search features, though, it’s not entirely foolproof. It suggested cherry recipes when I scanned a bag of cherry tomatoes. And a hunk of ginger managed to totally stump the feature. No matter what angle I held the camera, Snapchat was unable to recognize it as food, and instead recommended reptile and human hand-themed AR lenses.</p><p>The feature is also not meant to work with packaged foods — Snapchat has a separate feature that can scan those items for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-food-and-wine-labels-130019011.html"><ins>nutritional info</ins></a> — so it won’t be able to help you figure out what to do with that random can of tomato sauce or whatever else is collecting dust in the back of your pantry. But even with those limitations, the feature is still a useful starting point for when you’re out of ideas or just want to try something new. And, even when it doesn’t quite work, you might still find an entertaining new AR lens to try out.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchats-camera-can-scan-food-to-recommend-recipes-150040166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17f49f18-3fde-4824-bdd2-2814cb830970</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637028049</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T02:00:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat's camera can scan food for recipe inspo.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snapchat food scan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlayStation Remote Play now supports PS5 DualSense controllers on Android 12]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.remoteplay&amp;hl"><ins>PS Remote Play app</ins></a> on Android, which now has some extra controller features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2012/"><ins>Android 12</ins></a> users.

Thankfully, there&#39;s a somewhat more accessible option. The instrument brand has <a href="https://www.fender.com/acoustasonic/player/en">unveiled</a> an Acoustic Player Telecaster with both a more affordable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,200 price" href="https://fave.co/3osZV9k">$1,200 price</a> and a simpler design with a three-way voice selector (versus five on other models) and one blend knob.

This might be the ideal guitar if you need to play electric on stage, but acoustic in your apartment.</p><div id="2bcf24668fb94cf6af2f625cb33edf42"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5nAngwKsus?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-guitar-140315674.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">060fe199-dc73-4ba8-bdbf-0c7f827aae3f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:03:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637072730</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T14:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Musical Instruments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fd065390-46e8-11ec-bf7a-85322da96f5e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fd065390-46e8-11ec-bf7a-85322da96f5e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fender]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fender Acoustic Player Telecaster hybrid guitar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fender Acoustic Player Telecaster hybrid guitar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firefox Relay offers unlimited email aliases as part of its new premium plan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-rally-data-platform-130034616.html">Mozilla</a> launched <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/">Firefox Relay</a> as a free product that gives you five email aliases you can use every time you need to sign up for a random account online.

The version, called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html">1Password 8</a>, features a brand new design and new productivity and security capabilities. Company chief experience officer Matt Davey said 1Password created a whole new design language dubbed Knox for the project to help ensure consistency across devices. As we mentioned in the past, categories have moved from the sidebar to a dropdown menu, and you&#39;ll also see new icons and the option to switch to dark mode.</p><p>The new version was built to be faster than its predecessor, with a feature called Quick Access that gives you a way to find and use saved credentials even when the 1Password app isn&#39;t open. There&#39;s also a new Item Catalog feature that guides you through the process of viewing or adding items, and smart suggestions that recommend matches as soon as you type in your search term.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the security front, 1Password 8 comes with a new Watchtower Dashboard that helps you identify weak or compromised passwords and inactive two-factor log-ins. You&#39;ll also be able to restore deleted items, which can be extremely helpful for when accidents happen, and you&#39;ll be able to share log-in details with anyone through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-passwords-new-feature-will-let-you-securely-share-logins-with-anyone-130044719.html">Psst!</a> The company introduced the password-sharing feature in October, giving you a way to safely share logins with co-workers or clients even if they don&#39;t have an account themselves.</p><p>1Password also made the latest version available for early access on Macs in August, a couple of months after early access came out for Windows. It has yet to announce when general availability will be open for Mac users, but it did say in the past that it expects to release 1Password 8 for Apple&#39;s OS later this year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-officially-available-windows-140021850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccb84f7e-72d6-40c5-8ad8-7e539edcd204</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637069982</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T13:39:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c9e47c0-46db-11ec-bffb-b7e54357990e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c9e47c0-46db-11ec-bffb-b7e54357990e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[1Password]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[1Password]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1Password]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 is back down to $600 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw the 512GB Mac Mini M1 go on sale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-512-gb-returns-to-a-record-low-of-750-at-amazon-133540260.html">earlier this month</a> and now it&#39;s the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:base 256GB model&#39;s" href="https://amzn.to/3FkZBjH">base 256GB model&#39;s</a> turn to be discounted. The small desktop is $50 off on Amazon and it has an extra, automatically applied $50 coupon that will bring the final cost down to $600. That&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen and a great deal on the most affordable M1 machine available. If you&#39;re willing to pay a bit more for the extra storage, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3cdWXzU">512GB model</a> remains on sale for $750 thanks to another automatically applied coupon that knocks an additional $30 the sale price.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FkZBjH" id="a7915f9583e744bc8df4153d0c1e0789" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $600</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3cdWXzU" id="2da669df04994ca28836f39c6550a20f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $750</a><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/30owQDE">MacBook Air M1</a> starting at $999, the Mac Mini M1 is the most budget-friendly way to upgrade to a machine with one of Apple&#39;s latest chips. You can expect the Mac Mini to perform similarly to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air</a> — speedily and smoothly. We were impressed by the M1 chipset&#39;s performance — it made the MacBook Air feel lightning fast and native apps performed better than we&#39;ve ever seen them. The Mac Mini M1 has eight-core CPU, an eight-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks. You&#39;ll also get 8GB of RAM in this machine along with 256GB of storage. If you plan on storing a lot of photos, documents and other things on the desktop, you may want to spring for the 512GB model — or simply invest in a solid portable SSD that you can connect to the Mac Mini.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the rumor was that we would see an updated Mac Mini this year, that didn&#39;t end up happening. That means the machine looks much the same as it has for the past few years. It&#39;s a small silver box housing a variety of ports including two Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A connectors, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Thanks to its size, good array of ports and upgraded power with the M1 chip, the Mac Mini is a solid option for those who want a compact machine that doesn&#39;t compromise performance.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

It&#39;s a small device with a 4.9-inch display, and as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/15/balmuda-phone-japan/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> notes, its looks are highly reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-04-02-htc-one-x-review.html">HTC One X</a> that was released almost a decade ago. While Balmuda is known for designing unusual upmarket appliances in its home country, this announcement isn&#39;t entirely surprising: It <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Sleek-toaster-maker-Balmuda-to-serve-up-smartphones-in-Japan">revealed</a> back in May that it was making a foray into the smartphone market before the year ends.</p><p>The company teamed up with Kyocera to manufacture the Android device, which has 5G connectivity and supports wireless charging. Its 4.9-inch screen has a 1080p resolution, and it comes with a 48-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, as well as a fingerprint sensor. The Balmuda Phone is powered by a Snapdragon 765 processor, and it has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage and a 2,500 mAH battery capacity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, the company only has plans to release the phone in Japan. Those curious enough to give the device a shot can get it with a plan with Softbank, though they could also purchase an unlocked version if that&#39;s the better option. Pre-orders in the country will begin on November 17th at 10AM Japan time, and shipping will start on November 26th. Balmuda didn&#39;t say whether the device will eventually be available elsewhere, but the company did release the iconic &quot;The Toaster&quot; in the US last year for those who don&#39;t mind paying $329 to get perfectly toasted bread every time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/japanese-toaster-maker-balmuda-first-smartphone-112521675.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d1bc3fd-3124-43ac-b6f9-be5f3a299da7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:25:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637059771</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T10:49:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73eeb1c0-46c4-11ec-bdfd-c3cd47e42f09" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73eeb1c0-46c4-11ec-bdfd-c3cd47e42f09" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps grocery pickup feature expands to 2,000 US stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is bringing a bunch of updates to Maps this holiday season today, making the app more useful for getting around while you&#39;re gift- or grocery shopping. Most of the new features were either already announced or available in limited regions, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-indoor-live-view-eco-friendly-routes-pickup-and-delivery-integration-100020907.html">grocery shopping integration in select Fred Meyers stores in Oregon</a>. Now, after that pilot test, Pickup with Google Maps is available in over 2,000 stores in the US from the Kroger Family organization, including Kroger, Fry&#39;s, Ralphs and Marianos.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that when you shop at a participating outlet via its website, you&#39;ll be able to track your order status in Maps, share your ETA with the store and let them know when you&#39;ve arrived. According to Google, people who use pickup with Maps &quot;typically wait less than five minutes for their groceries.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also adding <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/maps101-popular-times-and-live-busyness-information/">Area Busyness</a> to Maps, which is similar to the existing graph you&#39;ll see in Google Search results for restaurants, businesses and popular attractions. It&#39;s also reminiscent of the feature that launched earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html">let Maps users see how crowded specific trains or buses</a> are in real time. With Area Busyness, you can check out how many people are in a specific neighborhood, as well as the individual &quot;restaurants, shops and recreational places (like a museum) within it,&quot; Google said. It&#39;ll be available globally on Android and iOS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ab7dd5d0-4688-11ec-8ffb-0408a281f137" style="height:972;width:2000;" alt="A composite of four phone screenshots showing the four steps on how the new Pickup with Google Maps works. " data-uuid="038598a3-c578-33de-b0e1-23f4721e249f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In the US, Google wants to help budget-conscious diners hone in on restaurant search results by offering price ranges based on contributions from other Maps users. You&#39;ll see how much a meal at each establishment typically costs, like $10 to $20 for example, and the number of people that estimate is based on. You can also tap into the details to see how many people submitted a price range, just like you&#39;d see the number of reviewers who rated a product one, two, three, four or five stars on most shopping sites.</p><p>You can add your own feedback about how much you paid at each place, and Google is also making it easier to add info like whether there&#39;s outdoor seating, curbside pickup and delivery options in your reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the company is bringing the Directory tab to Android and iOS for all airports, malls and transit stations around the world. In the past, this was <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-maps-adds-mall-directory-search-browse-local-panel-292366">selectively available</a> under the more information section of specific malls or businesses. Now, &quot;when we have this data available,&quot; Google said, you&#39;ll be able to get detailed information about the types of stores in a building, like parking lots, airline lounges, toy stores or clothing outlets, and see a list of shops in each category. It&#39;ll also show opening hours, store ratings and the floor they&#39;re on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-area-busyness-directory-grocery-pickup-updates-110055937.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28427e62-4c40-4ba6-89c9-d320711f334d</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637031850</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T03:04:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b766a60-4684-11ec-9bbf-3d27374f47c0" width="2096" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b766a60-4684-11ec-9bbf-3d27374f47c0" width="2096" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A graphic showing the Google Maps logo surrounded by drawings of buildings, snowflakes, holiday lights, cars and silhouettes of trees, a frozen pond and a skater on it.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Maps holiday updates 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impossible Meatballs are heading to Walmart]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after releasing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html"><ins>Impossible Nuggets</ins></a> as well as <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005208/en/Impossible%E2%84%A2-Sausage-Made-From-Plants-Arrives-in-Home-Kitchens"><ins>Impossible Sausage</ins></a> in grocery stores, the California-based company is introducing yet another faux meat product. It’s called Impossible Meatballs, and unlike the others, it’s actually debuting in retail before restaurants. Impossible Meatballs will be available at Walmart stores this month and at additional retailers later this year. They’re priced at around $6.48 per pack.</p><p>Instead of being made out of one “animal,” the Impossible Meatball was designed to be a mix of both “beef” and “pork.” According to the company, each meatball is a custom mix of Impossible Burger and Impossible Sausage along with a “homestyle meatball” seasoning blend that includes dried onions and garlic. They come in a resealable freezer bag, and each contains around 14 or so meatballs. There’s around 12 grams of protein per serving.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3c1033d0-46c1-11ec-b95f-54ede99d4fec" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Impossible Meatballs" data-uuid="f5c7431e-d26a-3188-9ae6-e9af462fe2da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I received a sample of the meatballs over the weekend. They come already cooked so all you need to do is reheat them via the oven, microwave, stovetop or air fryer. The oven method was listed as recommended so I baked them in a single layer on a baking tray in a 350-degree oven for 17 minutes. The end result is quite delicious — very savory and moist. I could still tell they weren’t really made out of meat though; they lacked a certain texture that I missed. But when I doused them in marinara sauce, that didn’t quite matter as much.</p><p>In addition to selling Impossible Meatballs, Walmart will also introduce a dedicated plant-based section of its frozen aisle that will feature various Impossible Foods products. That includes Impossible Chicken Nuggets, Impossible Sausage in spicy and savory flavors, Impossible Burger and the aforementioned Impossible Meatballs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ca73c90-46c1-11ec-bdde-256b0a44c5b7" style="height:1166;width:2000;" alt="Impossible Meatballs" data-uuid="804b6bff-9a96-39da-a27d-5443c016bca9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ErinKunkel</div></figure><p>According to the company, Impossible Meatballs is a retail-led product aimed at grocery shoppers. That’s a slightly different strategy than the company’s previous faux meat products, which debuted at restaurants first before being rolled out to grocery stores. However, Impossible Meatballs will still be available for restaurants later this month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/impossible-meatballs-110028994.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebc09b92-2f59-482d-ab12-5422b8ea7188</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637056365</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T09:52:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ca73c90-46c1-11ec-bdde-256b0a44c5b7" width="2000" height="1166" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1fe02b20-46c1-11ec-a37f-b2475a9b4312" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engaget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Impossible Meatballs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Impossible Meatballs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon launches a dedicated Prime Video app for Mac]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has released a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333">Prime Video app for Mac</a>, and you can now get it for free from the App Store.

The car soccer game for iOS and Android was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-mobile-game-ios-android-psyonix-173433198.html">revealed earlier in March</a> as a mobile, 2D version of <em>Rocket League</em> that lets you play solo or team up with a friend for two vs. two matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the regular 3D <em>Rocket League</em> perspective, <em>Sideswipe</em> has a 2D side-on view, as the name suggests. It uses touch controls that are relatively easy to master, according to Psyonix, but will also offer advanced control mechanics for better players. As with the original, it will offer a ranking system for competitive modes with plenty of car customization options.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="788ccaf3c32c4d14b357573daa7cc662"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/leYd3809NNA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As the game trailer above shows, it looks to capture the spirit of the original game and actually crosses over in one way. As the developer detailed, logging in with your Epic Games account for online matches will let you earn extra XP across both <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Sideswipe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Every time you level up in <em>Sideswipe</em>, you&#39;ll earn a &#39;Bonus Win&#39; in <em>Rocket League</em>. Then, once you win an Online Match in <em>Rocket League</em>, you&#39;ll get extra XP for that Bonus Win. Bonus Wins can also be earned for <em>Sideswipe </em>by playing<em> Rocket League, </em>so enjoy the extra XP in both games,&quot; Psyonix wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Psyonix no doubt launched Rocket League Sideswipe in Oceania (Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia)  to shake out any bugs, but confirmed that the game will launch globally before the end of the year. So far, however, it has yet to provide any details for a further rollout.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile-has-launched-into-pre-season-073500710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83840e08-deed-402c-8307-5863a2067efb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 07:35:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637047216</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T07:20:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/be09b500-46a8-11ec-bf3f-392cebe17d3b" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/be09b500-46a8-11ec-bf3f-392cebe17d3b" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Psyonix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' for mobile has launched into pre-season]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' for mobile has launched into pre-season]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alexa can now 'Play Something' on Netflix if you ask it to]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-shuffle-play-feature-160057616.html">launched</a> Play Something earlier this year as a way to help viewers who may be suffering from decision fatigue and just want to watch anything that may suit their taste at the end of the day. Now, viewers can even <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/alexa-play-something-on-netflix-e8d8f4fe5115">ask Alexa</a> to do it for them.

Charlotte Maines, Director of Fire TV, said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Over the past 12 months, we’ve seen that Fire TV customers that used voice engaged with content almost twice as much as those who didn’t.

According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/space-exploration-science-business-697f5aa719331ab6e74102ebb06b52d8?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"><em>Associated Press</em></a>, US Space Command started tracking the space junk in the early hours of the morning. The situation saw the station pass the debris field every 90 minutes, forcing those on board to close and reopen several compartments multiple times throughout the day. The four American, one German and two Russian astronauts aboard the ISS will need to stay on alert for the next several days.</p><p>&quot;Thanks for a crazy but well-coordinated day, we really appreciated all the situational awareness you gave us,&quot; US astronaut Mark Vande Hei told NASA mission control before he and the other crew members aboard went to bed at 12PM EST.  &quot;It was certainly a great way to bond as a crew, starting off our very first workday in space.&quot; Four of the astronauts arrived at the station late last week.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d5c44e2b9abe4462835e785faffa69f5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The U.S. State Department confirms and condemns that Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test in low Earth orbit.<br><br>Full statement: <a href="https://t.co/2WIUuWV6Mh">pic.twitter.com/2WIUuWV6Mh</a></p>— Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1460330386085531649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Neither NASA nor the US government has said what created the debris field that put the ISS in danger. However, later in the day, the US State Department condemned a Russian missile test that destroyed one of the country’s own satellites and created more than 1,500 trackable pieces of orbital debris. “The test will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. “Russia’s dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia’s claims of opposing the weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.”</p><p>The State Department said the US would work with its allies to respond to Russia’s act. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-reports-debris-generating-event-outer-space-2021-11-15/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the country has yet to comment on the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Along with their partners, NASA and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency frequently move the International Space Station to avoid incoming space junk.

With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board.&quot;</p><p>“All nations have a responsibility to prevent the purposeful creation of space debris from ASATs and to foster a safe, sustainable space environment,&quot; he continued. “NASA will continue monitoring the debris in the coming days and beyond to ensure the safety of our crew in orbit.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-debris-field-215745675.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c232c067-6f28-4955-ac46-bcb6ab9f87a4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 21:57:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637020330</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T23:52:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c1a9f0-465d-11ec-bff7-25df01936713" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c1a9f0-465d-11ec-bff7-25df01936713" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[European Space Agency]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[International Space Station]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[International Space Station]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat is adding TikTok-like AR music lenses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap has signed a music licensing deal with Sony Music Entertainment.

Highlights include the entire Max Payne series and F.E.A.R franchise, in addition to <em>Skate 2 </em>and <em>Star Wars: Jedi Knight II. </em></p><p>Every title Microsoft is adding today will support Auto HDR on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. You&#39;ll also see an increase in resolution when playing original Xbox games. The Xbox Series X and Xbox One X will render those titles at four times their native resolution, while the Xbox Series S will do so at three times and Xbox One S and Xbox One at double. Additionally, 11 titles will support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-backwards-compatible-170055413.html">FPS Boost</a>. The feature increases the framerate of a game up to 60 frames per second. 26 titles that were already a part of the backward compatibility library will now support FPS Boost as well. Included in that list are <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV, Dragon Age: Origins </em>and<em> Dead Space 2.  </em>&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before today, the last time Microsoft added any new titles to the backward compatibility program was in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-10-xbox-backward-compatibility-scarlett.html">2019</a>. At the time, that was supposed to be the end of the road for the initiative. Now, Microsoft says this is the final update. &quot;While we continue to stay focused on preserving and enhancing the art form of games, we have reached the limit of our ability to bring new games to the catalog from the past due to licensing, legal and technical constraints,&quot; Xbox Compatibility Program Lead Peggy Lo said. Hopefully the final list of approximately 700 games includes some of your favorite titles.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatability-76-games-annoucement-185623778.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33903a1f-a6de-48dd-9de3-ec0e75c4b827</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 18:56:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637002588</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T18:56:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9776d2b0-4644-11ec-8f7b-372b8a9ebab2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9776d2b0-4644-11ec-8f7b-372b8a9ebab2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox Backward compatibility program]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox Backward compatibility program]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Halo Infinite's free multiplayer mode is available now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rumors started swirling over the last few days that Microsoft will release the free <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/halo%20infinite/"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> multiplayer mode before the full game.

Since Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">bought Bethesda Softworks owner ZeniMax Media</a> earlier this year, questions have been swirling around platform exclusivity for ongoing franchises, such as Elder Scrolls, Doom and Fallout.</p><p>Spencer previously noted exclusivity would be decided on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-game-pass-exclusives-roundtable-phil-spencer-184648938.html">&quot;case-by-case basis.&quot;</a> He later said Microsoft would &quot;continue to invest in communities of players&quot; and that &quot;there might be things that have either contractual things or legacy on different platforms that we&#39;ll go do.&quot; Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-game-pass-exclusives-roundtable-phil-spencer-184648938.html">he was adamant</a> that the ZeniMax/Bethesda deal was largely about &quot;delivering great exclusive games.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/xbox-phil-spencer-todd-howard-interview"><em>GQ</em></a> to mark the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-170016982.html">20th anniversary of Xbox</a>, Spencer strongly hinted that, like next year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html"><em>Starfield</em></a>, <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> will be locked to Xbox consoles, PC and Xbox Cloud Gaming. “It’s not about punishing any other platform, like I fundamentally believe all of the platforms can continue to grow,” he said. “But in order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have.
