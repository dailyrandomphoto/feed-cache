The network has <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/">unveiled</a> a CNN+ service that will offer a blend of live and on-demand shows that are &quot;separate and distinct&quot; from existing TV coverage. It will debut sometime in the first quarter of 2022. CNN hasn&#39;t narrowed down the price, but lead executive Andrew Morse told <em>Variety</em> in an <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/">interview</a> that there wouldn&#39;t be an ad-supported tier at launch.</p><p>The centerpiece, as you&#39;d expect, will be the live material. CNN+ plans to offer eight to 12 hours of in-depth topical coverage and &quot;lifestyle&quot; material every day, with both veterans and newcomers at the helm. You&#39;ll also have chances to interact with anchors and experts in real-time discussions. This won&#39;t be a digital replica of CNN&#39;s usual news, then, but you may have reasons to tune in every day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The on-demand catalog unsurprisingly taps into CNN&#39;s existing collection, including shows like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> and <em>United Shades of America</em>. There will be original shows and movies for the internet service, although CNN+ won&#39;t reveal those until later in 2021.</p><p>Officially, Morse said CNN+ wouldn&#39;t be bundled or otherwise tie into HBO Max despite the WarnerMedia connection. <em>Variety</em> sources, however, claimed there was a &quot;strong probability&quot; the service would be bundled with HBO Max and Discovery+ after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">WarnerMedia and Discovery</a> finalize their merger.</p><p>Morse considered the CNN+ launch the largest the network has had since it started TV service in June 1980. It was also a chance to experiment with formats that blur distinctions between entertainment and news, the executive added.</p><p>The question, of course, is whether or not viewers will bite. CNN has had success with long-form content like the late Anthony Bourdain&#39;s shows, but it&#39;s not clear if people are ready to pay a monthly fee to see them. There&#39;s also the matter of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-please-stop-making-streaming-services.html">streaming service overload</a> — you might not be thrilled to subscribe to yet another offering just to be sure you catch everything CNN has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cnn-plus-streaming-service-launch-153702038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b42bb611-7e1e-4966-a69a-6ca3ae388f30</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:37:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626709024</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:37:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dish will pay AT&T $5 billion to serve its mobile customers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/at&amp;t"><ins>AT&amp;T</ins></a> is set to provide voice, data and messaging services to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dish%20network"><ins>Dish</ins></a>&#39;s Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless customers for the next 10 years.

Prop up your phone, stand 10 feet away and you can walk through a familiar &quot;can you read this&quot; test that will gauge whether or not your glasses or contacts need updating.</p><p>The update isn&#39;t automatic. An eye doctor will review the results and give you a verdict within two days. If you&#39;re seeing well enough, you&#39;ll just need to pay $15 to renew your prescription. If you&#39;re either struggling or just aren&#39;t eligible to use the app (see below), Warby Parker will recommend that you get a thorough eye exam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is clear that this isn&#39;t a replacement for your eye doctor, and that you&#39;ll have to meet certain criteria beyond what we just mentioned. You have to be between 18 and 65 years old, with no existing eye health concerns and a single-vision distance prescription.</p><p>The approach relies on iOS&#39; Vision Framework to measure your distance from your iPhone and ensure that you&#39;re far enough away from a proper test. We&#39;ve asked Warby Parker about an Android version, although that might take a while given that it would need a rough equivalent to Vision Framework.</p><p>The motivations behind Virtual Vision Test are clear — on top of the renewal fee, this could lead to more people buying Warby Parker glasses and visiting the company&#39;s stores. Regardless, it could be very useful if you either can&#39;t make time to update your prescription or are still skittish about a visit while COVID-19 remains a concern.</p><div id="69f7067959d24c01ac391727048578e4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warby-parker-virtual-vision-test-app-150052775.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6bf0d22d-d6a2-44d7-88b4-3f74ce2a8a6a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626707495</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:11:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eye Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warby Parker]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gadgets for students under $50]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The little things can get you when you’re in college. You arrive on campus, fresh and ready to go, but before you know it, you’re a few weeks into the new semester and you have a long list of small things you forgot to pack and need to buy ASAP. We at Engadget also know from experience that there are unassuming gadgets that can make your collegiate life easier. To help you get ahead of the game, we’ve compiled the best school gadgets under $50 so you can buy the most crucial ones before you even step on campus.</p><h2>Anker PowerExtend Cube USB-C power strip</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a111c41-df36-11eb-b6fd-1b0b78f3f641"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Basic, two-receptacle wall outlets just don’t cut it anymore now that we all have a small army of devices that we rely on every day.

This cube has two USB-A ports, one 30W USB-C port and three AC outlets, giving you more ways to keep your laptop, phone, tablet, headphones and other devices charged up. The five-foot cable is another perk as it prevents you from needing to hug the wall of the library in order to get things done. Also, it weighs just 9.2 ounces so you can bring it with you whenever you need your own personal charging station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy PowerExtend strip at Amazon - $40" href="https://amzn.to/3htSgnw">Buy PowerExtend strip at Amazon - $40</a></p><h2>Incase Bionic accessories organizer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a077f53-df36-11eb-b7ed-ebe176fffb42"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Staying organized is key to staying sane while in school, and that’s true for both your digital and physical essentials.

It has a number of pen loops inside for those that prefer to take handwritten notes, but it also has a bunch of variously sized pockets that can easily hold things like your portable hard drive, an extra phone charger and even a compact wireless mouse. And unlike those cheap pencil cases you’ll find at the dollar store, this one’s made of ocean-recycled material that’s the equivalent of seven plastic bottles.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Bionic accessory organizer at Incase - $50" href="https://fave.co/3waxXRA">Buy Bionic accessory organizer at Incase - $50</a></p><h2>Lention 4-in-1 USB-C hub</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a06bc01-df36-11eb-87df-e5193e919762"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Your brand new laptop might be blazing fast and super light, but it’s probably lacking in the port department.

It’s compact, measuring 3 x 1.4 inches, and it includes three USB-A ports and one USB-C port. That should let you connect accessories like mice and keyboards, and even access files on a thumb drive when you’re working on a group project. The USB-C port is charging only, but that’s not necessarily a downside — you can use it with your laptop’s power adapter and USB-C cable to power your machine while using the adapter at the same time.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lention 4-in-1 hub at Amazon - $20" href="https://amzn.to/3AiPGtc">Buy Lention 4-in-1 hub at Amazon - $20</a></p><h2>Anker PowerLine II USB-C to Lightning cable (10-foot)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a06bc00-df36-11eb-bd4f-951d018715c5"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As a student, there’s nothing worse than realizing your iPhone is down to 2 percent battery when you’re in the middle of submitting an assignment online.

And since it plugs into a wall outlet, they never have to remember to charge the Echo Dot like they would with a portable speaker.

The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">declared</a> &quot;with a high degree of confidence&quot; that hackers linked to China&#39;s Ministry of State Security (MSS) were responsible for a digital espionage campaign using the Exchange vulnerabilities. Officials have confronted senior Chinese leadership with this and &quot;broader&quot; hostile online activity, the White House said.</p><p>The US further accused China of running an intelligence operation that relied on &quot;contract hackers&quot; who frequently launched attacks meant solely for profit, such as ransomware schemes and crypto jacking. The Chinese government&#39;s reported unwillingness to tackle these abuses is believed to hurt businesses, governments and infrastructure with &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in damage, the White House said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the Justice Department has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">revealed</a> indictments of four MSS-affiliated Chinese men for allegedly conducting an extended hacking campaign meant to steal intellectual property and trade secrets, including health research. The initiative, which ran between 2011 and 2018, reportedly saw Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, Zhu Yunmin and Wu Shurong compromise comptuers worldwide to grab information ranging from autonomous vehicle technology and chemical formulas through to research on Ebola, AIDS and other diseases.</p><p>Biden&#39;s administration has already taken multiple actions in response to attacks, including &quot;proactive network defense actions&quot; like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-hafnium-exchange-server-060721872.html">deleting backdoors</a> on compromised Exchange servers. It added private companies to its Unified Coordination Group to bolster its security incident response. CISA, the FBI and the NSA also released an advisory outlining China&#39;s strategy for compromising US and ally networks using the Exchange holes and other methods.</p><p>This comes on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dhs-tsa-cybersecurity-rules-pipeline-companies-colonial-pipeline-164141100.html">stricter security rules</a> for pipeline companies as well as a pilot to tackle vulnerabilities in sectors like electricity and water supply.</p><p>China has historically denied involvement in attacks like these, and it&#39;s doubtful the country will have a change of heart after this. The White House effort is more of a warning — the US will not only pin attacks on China, but respond to them in kind.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/white-house-blames-china-for-exchange-cyberattacks-132053693.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8552d474-22be-4f33-906d-24fe2f2f25c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:20:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626700856</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:21:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WANG ZHAO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chinese honour guards prepare for celebrations in Beijing on July 1, 2021, to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Whether you’re heading to a physical campus, taking classes online or a mix of both, a laptop is likely going to be the control center for your studies.</p><p>And things have changed quite a bit over the last year or so. We’ve seen the introduction of Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks and Microsoft just announced Windows 11. With ARM-based computers harkening a future where the line between mobile and desktop computing is blurry and Windows 11 working to bridge that gap by supporting Android apps, the laptop market is the most exciting it’s been in years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But that might lead to more questions for shoppers. What should you look out for if you want an ARM-based PC? Will they run  Windows 11 when that update is available? What are some key specs you should add to your must-have list this year? We compiled this guide to help you make the right choice, alongside a list of this year’s best laptops.</p><h2>What to look for in a laptop for school (and what to avoid)</h2><p>First: Windows on ARM still isn’t worth it. Snapdragon laptops may look and feel classy, offer excellent battery life and cellular connections, but they’re typically too expensive, especially considering their limited app compatibility and finicky software. Apple’s M1 MacBooks, on the other hand, are great for almost everyone, barring those who need external GPUs, niche software or more than 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Over on the Intel side of things, almost every notebook released this year packs an 11th-generation Core processor. You’ll likely be able to find a cheaper version of a product with a 10th-generation chip, and it should still serve you well. And don’t forget about AMD’s Ryzen, either — they’re plenty powerful and no longer just for the bargain bin. If you&#39;re eagerly awaiting the arrival of Windows 11 devices, don&#39;t expect to see them before the semester begins. They&#39;re more likely to show up in the fall around Microsoft&#39;s usual hardware event in October.</p><p>Across the industry, companies have shifted to taller aspect ratios for their screens. The Surface Laptops sport 3:2 panels, and many Dell and HP models offer 16:10. While the older 16:9 format is nice for watching videos, you’ll probably appreciate a taller option when you’re writing an essay. Some devices, like Dell’s XPS and Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro, come with OLED panels, which will be nice for working with photos and videos. They usually cost more and take a toll on battery life, though, so you’ll need to weigh your priorities.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a diverse selection of laptops around, so you should be able to find a suitable one regardless of your preferences. Here are our favorite notebooks for your return to academia.</p><h2><strong>Apple MacBook Air M1</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37c97a60-df2f-11eb-9ecb-f6cb740aca90"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With its swift performance, slim fanless design and excellent battery life, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">MacBook Air M1</a> is a no-brainer for any Apple user. You’ll appreciate familiar features like the Retina display, solid keyboard and trackpad. Plus thanks to the company’s excellent Rosetta 2 emulator software, you won’t notice a huge performance difference when relying on Intel apps.</p><p>The big news though, is the ARM-based M1 allows the laptop to run iPhone and iPad apps too. While not every app will be available on macOS, the potential for more options on your desktop here is great. Now you just have to make sure you can keep the distractions at bay — which should be easy with the upcoming Focus modes on macOS Monterey, which rolls out later this year.</p><p>Unfortunately for those looking for more internal storage or something to run their bespoke video streaming setup, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> tops out at 256GB storage while both the Air and the Pro only go up to 16GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro M1 also lacks support for multiple monitors and an external GPU. Those with more demanding workflows might need to look to Windows or an Intel-powered MacBook to ensure app compatibility.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Dell XPS 13</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53f7ae50-df2f-11eb-abef-05df19e0597f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Dell’s XPS series has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">our favorite for years</a>. Despite a somewhat plain design that some might call “classic,” the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">XPS 13</a> still stands out for nailing pretty much everything a laptop should have. Great performance? Check. Gorgeous screen? Check. Comfortable keyboard? Check. Throw in a long-lasting battery and a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-laptops-11th-gen-intel-cpus-130009045.html">the latest versions</a>, and you’ve got a powerful workhorse for all your classes (and more).</p><p>The company shifted to a 16:10 aspect ratio in 2020, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">recently added a 4K OLED option</a>. That means you’ll see greater contrast ratios and deeper blacks for maximum display goodness. The OLED configuration will cost you $300 more than the Full HD LCD option, but those who want the best viewing experience may not mind the premium. We also recommend you spend a little more and get at least the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM" href="https://bit.ly/3ywh0CO">Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM</a> instead of the meager 4GB that the base model offers.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930</a></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e0b8dc0-df2f-11eb-bbe7-52280094a124"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for an excellent typing experience, look no further than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop 4" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Surface Laptop 4</a>. Microsoft has killed it with the keyboards on its recent Surface Laptops and this one’s no different. Though they’re not as deep and springy as ThinkPads, the buttons here are deliciously responsive and have ample travel. The roomy trackpad is solid, too.</p><p>Of course, it’s important that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-4-review-2021-bigger-better-ultraportable-133047360.html">Surface Laptop 4</a> deliver on everything else, or we wouldn’t recommend it. The 15-inch version that we tested offered breezy performance, respectable battery life and a lovely 3:2 Pixelsense screen which supports Microsoft’s Surface Pen input. Though its design is a little staid, the Surface Laptop 4 still has a clean, professional design and a luxurious aluminum case that&#39;s sturdy enough to withstand being stuffed in your backpack. Plus, at 3.4 pounds, it won&#39;t burden your shoulders too much.</p><p>The best thing about the Surface Laptop 4 is that its base model, which comes equipped with AMD’s Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of RAM, starts at $1,000. That rivals the Dell XPS 13, making it a better buy for the value-conscious: You get more screen, more power and more RAM for the money. Both the Surface and the XPS are great options, but the latter offers an OLED panel and thinner bezels that make it look more modern.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8391a7b0-df2f-11eb-9fdf-c928301f5bd2"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For those whose priority is light weight, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Book Pro" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Galaxy Book Pro</a> series should be at the top of your list. At just 2.36 pounds for the clamshell and 3.06 pounds for the convertible model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review-price-specs-130006444.html">15-inch Galaxy Book Pro</a> is one of the lightest 15-inch laptops around. It’s also super thin at 0.46 inches thick, and despite its compact size it manages to house three USB-C ports (one of them supporting Thunderbolt 4), a microSD card reader and a headphone jack.</p><p>It also packs an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor and at least 8GB of RAM, along with a 68Whr battery that delivers a similar runtime to the Dell XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4. That’s particularly impressive given the Galaxy Book Pro has a Super AMOLED screen, which offers sumptuous image quality, high contrast ratio and deep blacks. Unfortunately, Samsung is still stuck on a 16:9 aspect ratio, which will feel outdated in a year or two, but it’s not a deal breaker.</p><p>The Galaxy Book Pro’s keyboard isn’t as comfortable as the Surface Laptop 4’s but it’s pleasant enough, and the trackpad is enormous. We’re more concerned about the odd webcam software that makes you look dark and splotchy, so if looking your best on video calls is of concern you might want to consider something else. Plus, the $1,100 base model comes with an Intel Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage, making it a competitive offering against the Dell and Surface laptops. Awful camera aside, there’s plenty to love about the Galaxy Book Pro, especially for those looking to lighten their loads.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999</a></p><h2>Acer Chromebook Spin 713</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f3731fb0-df2e-11eb-997e-b8fa781ff86f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re considering saving a few hundred bucks by opting for Chrome OS, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer Chromebook Spin 713" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWzeYv">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a> might be the right choice. Sure, there are cheaper Chromebooks out there, but it’s one of few machines with a 3:2 aspect ratio and has a utilitarian design that makes it perfect for butterfingers.</p><p>That price also gets you an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and sturdy 360-degree hinge so you can set it up in a variety of modes. The 13.5-inch screen is also more pixel-dense than most 1080p displays of the same size. Though the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">Spin 713</a> only clocked about 8 hours on our battery test, that’s enough to get you through a work day. If $700 feels too expensive for a Chromebook, you could also wait till it inevitably goes on sale to save a bit more. There are sleeker, more powerful Chromebooks available, but Acer’s Spin 713 offers a good mix of performance and a modern screen for the money.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $700" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWzeYv">Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $700</a></p><h2><strong>Acer Aspire 5</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1a4b6de0-df2f-11eb-b3f6-fa8726392216"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If price is your utmost concern, then we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer Aspire 5" href="https://fave.co/36hK70i">Acer Aspire 5</a>. It’s a 15-inch Windows laptop with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage that costs between $400 and $450. Yes, that’s less memory than anything else on this list, but it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">costs much less</a> than any of our non-Chromebook suggestions.</p><p>There’s plenty of ports here — including an Ethernet socket — and the aluminum chassis should make this laptop feel more expensive than it is. You’ll also appreciate its reliable performance, comfortable keyboard and 1080p display. For the price, the Aspire 5 offers everything you need to get through the school day, making it a great bargain.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Aspire 5 at Acer starting at $399" href="https://fave.co/36hK70i">Buy Aspire 5 at Acer starting at $399</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0033e2b5-610e-3f15-9d56-aa74b5d388e3</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:06:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626700918</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:22:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[Dell]]></category><category><![CDATA[xps13]]></category><category><![CDATA[galaxybookflex]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[MacBookAir]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></category><category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[bts2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[surfacego2]]></category><category><![CDATA[SurfaceLaptop3]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7e73d400-df2b-11eb-8b7d-224d93864217" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7e73d400-df2b-11eb-8b7d-224d93864217" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Three laptops against a bright colorful background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Laptops - Back to School ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA shows 'Wolfenstein: Youngblood' with RTX ray-tracing on ARM]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mediatek-arm-pcs-gpus-170021586.html">recently said</a> that it was working with MediaTek to bring RTX graphics to ARM-based laptops, and now it has shown what that might look like for gamers. At the Game Developers Conference (GDC), it <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/">unveiled</a> a technical demo with an RTX-powered MediaTek ARM processor running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-wolfenstein-youngblood-e3-demo-video.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>NVIDIA showed off real time ray-traced reflections and DLSS on the game using an ARM-based platform for the first time. It also showed off a demo called <em>Bistro</em> (from Amazon&#39;s Lumberyard game engine) running real-time ray-tracing on ARM, with RTX direct illumination (RTXDI) and NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser (NRD) features turned on. The demos ran on a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 ARM-based platform combined with a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c9dc21c047b40eeb74ffd727199a46f"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBfci5hYN1c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA made the tech work by porting several RTX SDKs to ARM devices. Those include deep learning super sampling (DLSS) to boost sharpness, RTX direct illumination, NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser, the RTX memory utility (RTXMU) and RTX global illumination. NVIDIA said that the RTXDI, NRD and RTXMU SDKs for ARM with Linux are now available for developers, with RTXGI and DLSS coming soon.</p><p>Of course, you won&#39;t get to see any of this until manufacturers add RTX hardware to their ARM-based laptops, Chromebooks or other devices. Game manufacturers will also need to implement the tech for ARM-based games. However, both the <em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em> developer and game engine company seem bullish.&nbsp;</p><p>“RTX support for ARM and Linux opens up new opportunities for game developers to provide more immersive experiences on a wider variety of platforms,” said Unity&#39;s senior technical product manager Mathieu Muller. &quot;An iD Tech-based game running on an ARM CPU with ray tracing enabled is a significant step in a journey that will result in many more gaming platforms being available to all game developers,&quot; added Machinegames CTO Jim Kjellin.</p><p>Of course, NVIDIA&#39;s relationship with ARM is set to get a whole lot closer as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-arm-acquisition-softbank-000846113.html">bought the company</a> last year for $40 billion. However, the deal is subject to regulatory approval and NVIDIA rival (and ARM customer) Qualcomm has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">objected</a> to the deal. On top of that, ARM employees 3,000 people in the UK and that country&#39;s regulator is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-cma-investigating-nvidia-arm-acquisition-130504069.html">investigating</a> the sale.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-shows-wolfenstein-youngblood-running-rtx-ray-tracing-on-arm-130037247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c1b8331-66aa-43d0-83f7-db4b277ce035</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626701816</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:37:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An onscreen example of NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Klipsch's newest soundbars offer 8K HDR passthrough and Dolby Atmos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Klipsch has a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-klipsch-soundbars-at-ces-2020.html">futureproof soundbars</a>, and that&#39;s certainly true of its latest models.

Sound quality is noticeably better than previous AirPods models, thanks in part to a built-in amplifier and  Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-range frequencies to your ears. Active noise-cancellation does a good job blocking out surrounding sounds and the earbuds&#39; touch controls let you quickly enter Transparency Mode whenever you need to hear the world around you.</p><p>But the AirPods Pro carved out a spot on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">our favorite wireless earbuds</a> list because of how easy they are to use with other Apple products.

Ocado — which competes with Amazon Fresh — has been forced to cancel orders for some customers after a robot collision sparked a fire at its warehouse in south-east London. The incident appeared to involve three bots on the grid and led to the evacuation of its Erith customer fulfilment center, the company <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/response-to-fire-at-erith">said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ocado revealed that the fire triggered the site&#39;s sprinkler system, but was contained by its mitigation measures. Nonetheless, the London Fire Brigade was called to the scene to deal with the blaze, the company added. In all, Ocado said the damage was limited to just 1 percent of its grid, adding that it would take a week for the facility to resume operations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UK company&#39;s south-east London warehouse contains 3,000 robots that move at 13 feet per second when fetching grocery orders. Ocado also licenses its automation platform to others including <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/our-solutions/our-global-partners/kroger">Kroger</a> in the US, which recently deployed the system at its 375,000-square-foot customer fulfillment center in Monroe, Ohio.</p><p>Based on the proximity of the droids and the speedy nature of their task, it&#39;s a miracle more clashes haven&#39;t occurred. As detailed in a recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/world/ocado-supermarket-robot-warehouse-spc-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> report, the bots — described as &quot;washing machines on wheels&quot; — move within five millimeters of each other on a grid-like system to collect items. Ocado even told the news publication &quot;we basically play chicken with them: they go on a collision course only to divert at the last moment.&quot;</p><div id="7e3a207efa7542b88805857b854c7d67"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssZ_8cqfBlE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ocado-robot-collision-fire-114027027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c5b5257-78e5-42ae-a0f4-8d7107c62147</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 11:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626694133</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T11:29:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7542a820-e881-11eb-beb7-052ca37e986b" width="1394" height="811" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7542a820-e881-11eb-beb7-052ca37e986b" width="1394" height="811" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Japan breaks the internet speed record]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists at Japan&#39;s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-breaks-internet-speed-record-200136933.html">smashed the internet transfer record</a> by shifting data at 319Tbps, almost double the last speed test attempted in August 2020.

Zoom notes that it was already a &quot;long-term&quot; customer of Five9 and said the partnership will give Five9&#39;s business clients access to Zoom products like the multi-platform <a href="https://zoom.us/zoom-phone-features">Zoom Phone</a> app.</p><p>The acquisition won&#39;t have much of an impact on consumers, as Five9 is largely a business-to-business company. However, Zoom&#39;s recent growth has been fueled in part by employees needing to work and communicate from home due to the pandemic.

Tencent is to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-sumo-group-plc/15063228">fully acquire</a> Sumo Group, the UK developer behind <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and <em>Crackdown 3</em>. The Chinese web giant is offering 513 pence per share for the studio, in which it already owns an 8.75 percent stake, valuing it at $1.26 billion (£990 million).</p><p>The acquisition brings another major developer into the Tencent fold. Already the world&#39;s biggest gaming company, Tencent owns <em>League of Legends </em>studio Riot Games, and has a financial stake in several publishers including Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Bluehole, Paradox Interactive, Supercell, Grinding Gear Games and Yager, along with chat platform Discord. In February, the company acquired a minority position in <em>DayZ</em> developer Bohemia Interactive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But, Tencent&#39;s dominance has triggered regulatory pushback at home and abroad. Earlier this month, Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-live-streaming-firm-douyu-terminates-merger-deal-with-huya-2021-07-12/">blocked</a> its plan to merge its two game livestreaming sites, Douyu and Huya. Tencent is also negiotiating an agreement with a US national security panel that would allow it to retain its stakes in US companies<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Riot Games and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/chinas-tencent-is-reportedly-in-talks-with-us-to-keep-gaming-investments.html">according</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-tencent-talks-with-us-keep-gaming-investments-sources-2021-05-05/">multiple</a> reports.</p><p>The Sumo acquisition hands Tencent a mix of AAA and indie content. Alongside <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and spinoff <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-online-multiplayer-save-transfer-ps4-ps5-182149137.html"><em>Sackboy</em></a><em>, </em>both published by Sony,<em>&nbsp;</em>Sumo was also behind <em>Hitman 2. </em>It also owns UK-based indie developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/thechineseroom">The Chinese Room</a> (<em>Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture</em>) and Red Kite Games, best known for ports of games like <em>Two Point Hospital</em>. In February, the studio purchased Poland&#39;s PixelAnt Games for £250,000.</p><p>“The business will benefit from Tencent’s broad videogaming ecosystem, proven industry expertise and its strategic resources, which will help secure and further the aspirations and long-term success of Sumo,” Ian Livingstone, non-executive chairman of Sumo, said in a statement.</p><p>Between Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html">acquisition of ZeniMax</a> and EA&#39;s deal for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-completes-codemasters-acquisition-141803521.html">Codemasters</a>, 2021 is already turning out to be a blockbuster year for video game consolidation.

Last week, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/nintendo-switch-s-big-price-hike-takes-gamers-into-new-territory?sref=P6Q0mxvj"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> citing industry analysts claimed that the new model only cost Nintendo about $10 more per unit to produce, while the $350 price is $50 more than the previous model.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;A news report on July 15, 2021 (JST) claimed that the profit margin of the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) would increase compared to the Nintendo Switch.

However, the report involves potential profits and Nintendo specifically mentions &quot;investors,&quot; so it may have wanted to head this one off for fiduciary reasons. If <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s report was accurate, Nintendo would be making $40 more per Switch, a pretty notable boost. The OLED Switch replaces the LED display on the original Switch with a 7-inch 720p OLED screen and doubles the storage to 64GB, while adding an ethernet port and improved kickstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-nintendo-could-launch-two-new-switch-consoles-this-year.html">reports</a> also pointed to the possibility of Nintendo launching another console, the Switch Pro, with higher-end components and NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. However, Nintendo also shot down that rumor. &quot;We also want to clarify that we just announced that Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) will launch in October, 2021, and have no plans for launching any other model at this time,&quot; Nintendo added in a follow-up tweet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-denies-it-will-squeeze-more-profit-from-oled-switch-sales-074528512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f686c0e-a56a-459e-8c08-feb69b365d45</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:45:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626680730</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T07:45:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grimes, Will.i.am and Alanis Morrissette will judge an avatar singing TV show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you more comfortable singing behind a virtual persona than you are on a real stage?

It&#39;s just a question of whether or not audiences enjoy the concept. Anonymizing music shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fox-tubi-original-shows-151552495.html"><em>The Masked Singer</em></a> have been hits, but they still involve a physical presence for the

UC Riverside researchers have <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/07/16/air-powered-computer-memory-helps-soft-robot-control-movements">developed</a> pneumatic computer memory that they used to help a soft robot play keyboards.</p><p>Instead of conventional transistors and electric circuits, the &quot;air-powered&quot; memory relies on microfluidic valves that control airflow. Atmospheric pressure in a given valve represents a binary &quot;0,&quot; while a vacuum indicates a &quot;1.&quot; The researchers&#39; memory has a complex-enough array of these valves to function like an 8-bit RAM chip — not exactly powerful, but good enough that a pair of soft robot hands can play &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; at a slow but steady pace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The absence of positive pressure makes this particularly safe — there&#39;s no danger of the memory exploding  in mid-use.</p><p>The technology is far from ready for everyday use. Besides needed improvements to complexity and speed, a robot would need soft versions of processors and other components to completely eliminate the need for rigid electronics. The goal is clear, however. Pneumatic memory could at least reduce the need for chips in soft robots, and points to a future of completely flexible robotics that shouldn&#39;t hurt you if there&#39;s a collision.</p><div id="fca6e9ee57884d9c8aad3310d89da23e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnG7ApR5GS0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soft-robot-pneumatic-memory-200149552.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55844c3b-174e-4be8-99fb-bf3764c75fad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 20:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626699251</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T12:55:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UC Riverside]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NSO spyware was allegedly used to target activists and journalists]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Critics have previously claimed that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">NSO Group spyware</a> was misued to target the media and other innocent people, but new findings might have revealed the extent of that misuse. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">shared</a> a multi-partner investigation claiming that NSO&#39;s Pegasus software was used to successfully hack 37 phones, including journalists, activists and the two women closest to murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p><p>The victims were on a 2016-era list of 50,000 phone numbers from countries believed to conduct both extensive surveillance and use of NSO tools, such as Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The list included 1,000 people who didn&#39;t obviously fit the software&#39;s intended criminal targets, including over 600 politicians, 189 journalists, 85 humans rights activists and 65 business executives.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roughly a dozen Americans working overseas were on the list, but the investigation partners couldn&#39;t conduct forensic studies on most of their phones or find evidence of successful hacks. NSO previously said Pegasus couldn&#39;t be used to snoop on American devices.</p><p>NSO flatly denied the claims stemming from the investigation. It maintained that the information had &quot;no factual basis,&quot; and rejected the notion that Pegasus was used to target Khashoggi or his associates. It maintained that it shut down access &quot;multiple times&quot; over past abuses, and that the list was too large to be focused solely on numbers its client countries would have targeted. The company went so far as to hire a libel attorney, Thomas Clare, that accused the investigation partners of having &quot;misinterpreted and mischaracterized&quot; data while making &quot;speculative and baseless assumptions.&quot;</p><p>NSO has historically pinned abuse claims on the countries themselves, and has said it reviewed the human rights records of a given nation before doing business.</p><p>The report comes a year and a half after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html">Facebook sued NSO</a> for allegedly enabling call exploit attacks against WhatsApp, and mere months after Citizen Lab claimed that NSO software was used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">hack <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists&#39; iPhone</a>s using an iMessage flaw.

As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/18/gurman-iphone-13-apple-watch-always-on/">notes</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman used his weekly &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> to say the 2021 iPhone will potentially have an &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Apple Watch</a>-like&quot; always-on display with better battery life in addition to a 120Hz refresh rate, a smaller screen notch, an A15 chip and video recording upgrades.</p><p>Gurman didn&#39;t outline the always-on screen functionality. However, a past leak from Max Weinbach suggested Apple would use an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panel that, like on the Apple Watch and a few Android phones, could drop to extremely low refresh rates to offer persistent information without a large hit to battery life. You might see some notifications, battery life and the clock without having to wake up your phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The writer also used his newsletter to narrow the time frame for a long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">MacBook Pro redesign</a>. He now expects Apple to start mass production of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">mini LED</a>-equipped laptops in the third quarter of 2021 (aka this summer) with a launch between September and November. That&#39;s still somewhat vague, but it does suggest you won&#39;t have to wait until next year (or watch for a surprise early announcement).</p><p>The new MacBook Pros are rumored to have a &#39;flat&#39; design like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the new iMac</a> (minus the colors) while using a more powerful take on Apple&#39;s M1 chip that could support up to 64GB of RAM and more ports. Mini LEDs could deliver a screen that offers high contrast ratios and brightness while keeping battery life in check.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12s-always-on-display-leak-164539339.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e3e05f5-dba8-4379-8c1f-cab7b3cb91f2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 16:45:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626626742</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T16:45:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da2eba60-e7e3-11eb-bcbe-053ea084ddce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da2eba60-e7e3-11eb-bcbe-053ea084ddce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max display with multitasking in view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max display with multitasking in view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook rejects Biden claim it's 'killing people' with COVID-19 misinformation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook isn&#39;t exactly enthusiastic about President Biden&#39;s claim that it and other social networks are &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">killing people</a>&quot; by allowing COVID-19 misinformation to spread. The social media firm <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/">posted</a> a refutation of the allegations, using data to suggest that something other than Facebook was responsible for a slowdown in vaccination rates and a rise in cases.</p><p>The company noted that vaccine acceptance in user polling had risen from 70 percent in January 2021 to as high as 85 percent in July, and that cultural group disparities had declined &quot;considerably&quot; over the same period. This was ahead of Biden&#39;s goal of getting 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July — to Facebook, this was a sign the company was &quot;not the reason&quot; the US fell short of that target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook added that Canada and the UK had higher vaccination percentages despite using the social network about as much as their American counterparts. There&#39;s &quot;more than Facebook&quot; to the US results, the company said. It also pointed to its efforts to both promote <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-covid-19-forecasts-160038962.html">accurate claims</a> and fight falsehoods, including the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-notifications-harmful-coronavirus-misinformation-191233820.html">misinformation labels</a>, reduced exposure and takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet giant didn&#39;t attempt to find an alternate explanation for US troubles. Some observers have <a href="https://twitter.com/NGrossman81/status/1416724328591282176">pointed</a> to a possible link between political affiliation and vaccination rates, but Facebook didn&#39;t even hint at this in its refutal.</p><p>It&#39;s not a flawless argument. Facebook is trying to draw a link between its polling data and the entire US, which doesn&#39;t make for a neat and tidy comparison. The company also hasn&#39;t shared estimates of how much COVID-19 misinformation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">slips through the cracks</a>. The social site has a strong incentive to downplay its possible contribution to the problem given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html">past complaints</a> that it hasn&#39;t done enough to stop misinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the data shifts the attention back to the Biden administration — it may need to provide more substantial data if it&#39;s going to show that health misinformation on social networks like Facebook is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">major threat</a>, as the US Surgeon General recently said. If nothing else, it suggests the answer is a complicated one regardless of how much Facebook is responsible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-rejects-biden-covid-19-misinformation-154349002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a0aa434-f1e1-4b9a-99d1-f045fca245f7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 15:43:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626623031</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T15:44:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenage student receives a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during a vaccination event for local adolescents and adults outside the Bronx Writing Academy school in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 4, 2021.

Ideally, the rover could investigate the emissions and determine their true nature.</p><p>Curiosity has detected the methane spurts six times since landing on Mars in 2012, but scientists haven&#39;t had success locating their sources until now. Europe&#39;s Trace Gas Orbiter has also failed to spot methane at atmospheric levels. The Caltech team narrowed down the on-the-ground sources by modelling methane particles as packets and tracing their routes based on historical wind velocity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The research hasn&#39;t yet been peer-reviewed, so we&#39;d take it with a grain of caution. It&#39;s also entirely possible that the gas has non-organic origins. Even if that&#39;s the case, though, the burps could be tied to geological activity linked to liquid water. Early Mars reportedly held <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-04-early-mars-tsunami-evidence.html">massive amounts of water</a> — even if there&#39;s no active water at these sources, a close-up study could help illustrate Mars&#39; history.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/curiostiy-microbe-methane-burp-location-on-mars-210435829.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4f11f3a-c772-4171-b89b-2fd1db682b4b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 21:04:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626555877</ingested><modified>2021-07-17T21:04:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66d49040-e73d-11eb-bf6e-8e23a98843c4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66d49040-e73d-11eb-bf6e-8e23a98843c4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA Curiosity Mars rover selfie from October 11th, 2019]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA Curiosity Mars rover selfie from October 11th, 2019]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
