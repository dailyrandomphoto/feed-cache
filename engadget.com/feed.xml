Starting on November 30th, 20 Verizon stores nationwide will begin selling the device, with online availability to follow on December 2nd. The carrier will sell the glasses for $599, and while you can use them with either an Android or iOS device, Nreal says you’ll get the best experience with a OnePlus 8 or recent Samsung Galaxy phone — both of which Verizon will happily sell you.</p><p>We got our first look at the Light mixed reality glasses at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-sunglasses-hands-on.html">CES 2019</a>. The primary focus of the device is on entertainment and productivity applications. Nreal&#39;s Nebula software allows you to access your phone&#39;s Android apps without taking the glasses off. You can also use them as makeshift VR glasses, but the 52-degree diagonal field of view is limited compared to a dedicated headset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">793b4827-e2a1-4718-87d7-795a306ff49f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637197979</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T01:13:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4cbe5e60-480a-11ec-abff-307c102e7f8b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4cbe5e60-480a-11ec-abff-307c102e7f8b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nreal]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nreal Light]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nreal Light]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's Streambar hits an all-time low of $80 ahead of Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roku not only launched a new $15 streaming player <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-le-streaming-player-walmart-black-friday-082730326.html">yesterday</a>, it&#39;s discounting some other products ahead of Black Friday.

The new location — at 59th Street between Park &amp; Lexington Avenues — will combine the Starbucks app&#39;s order ahead feature with Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the store sounds a like a cross between the cafe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-amazon-big-go-grocery-store-seattle-cashless.html">Amazon Go</a> store, which served as the launching pad for the e-commerce giant&#39;s cashierless tech experience.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a lounge area customers can enter by using the &quot;In-Store Code&quot; in the Amazon Shopping app, by scanning their credit cards or by scanning their palm registered with Amazon One on the terminals onsite. Once they&#39;re in, they&#39;ll find a small Amazon Go market containing a curated selection of customer favorites from both companies. Anything they take from the shelf will be added to their virtual carts, and they will be charged after they leave like in any other location that uses Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out tech.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Over the past year-and-a-half, Amazon has expanded the availability of its cashierless technology.

Amazon also added the technology to a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">Whole Foods</a> locations and, more recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html">licensed</a> it for use to UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#39;s.

In a major shift in policy for Apple, the company is launching a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Self Service Repair program</a> that will let you repair products yourself using official Apple parts and tools.</p><p>It’ll launch in the US in early 2022 (rolling out later that year for other countries) and will initially give the resources to fix an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13. Apple says M1 Macs will follow after that.</p><p>So why the change? It could well be all this government pressure. The White House, the Federal Trade Commission and multiple states have backed right-to-repair measures that could have forced Apple’s hand. There was even a shareholder resolution deadline <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-shareholder-proposal-presses-apple-to-expand-access-to-repair/"><ins>coincidentally timed</ins></a> for the same day.</p><p>Once this program launches, any skilled person will be able to replace parts like the screen, camera and battery on the latest iPhone models. There will reportedly be 200 parts and tools available at the start.

That lets you take a picture then choose among 100 combinations of effects (including &quot;Soft Focus,&quot; &quot;Light Leak,&quot; &quot;Monochrome&quot; and &quot;Retro&quot;) and print the image afterward by pulling the print lever.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilms-hybrid-instax-mini-evo-camera-has-double-the-resolution-of-past-models-091009145.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-colorful-new-homepod-mini-is-on-sale-for-the-first-time-ahead-of-black-friday-135046185.html"><ins>Engadget Deals: Apple&#39;s colorful new HomePod mini is on sale for the first time ahead of Black Friday</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/artist-rights-groups-protest-amazon-palm-tech-100024591.html"><ins>Artists, activists demand concert venues drop Amazon&#39;s palm-scanning tech</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html"><ins>Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming arrives on consoles</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-101233882.html"><ins>Amazon says it will stop accepting UK-issued Visa credit cards on January 19th</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html"><ins>Mercedes&#39; EQS defines luxury EVs</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-062707716.html"><ins>Porsche unveils the Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo EVs</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-accused-of-copying-lightstream-obs-140742760.html"><ins>Streamlabs accused of copying material for its console streaming platform</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/alien-isolation-ios-android-release-date-163249099.html"><ins>&#39;Alien: Isolation&#39; is coming to iOS and Android on December 16th</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-ariya-ev-price-reservations-171536739.html"><ins>Nissan starts taking reservations for its $46,000 Ariya crossover EV</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tascam-portacapture-x8-annoucement-170543095.html"><ins>Tascam&#39;s Portacapture X8 is a beefy portable recorder with a smartphone-like interface</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-wearables-130050343.html">The best smartwatches, fitness trackers and wearables to gift</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-repair-i-phones-and-macs-yourself-121558268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">897ff350-dd3f-4ad5-ac70-2374fe4dcfe6</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:15:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637236749</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T11:59:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b44a09d0-47b0-11ec-9567-0b9e9bf6adc8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b44a09d0-47b0-11ec-9567-0b9e9bf6adc8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iFixit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro teardown by iFixit]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro teardown by iFixit]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's synchronized song lyrics are now available to everyone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-lyrics-united-states-test-ios-android-140045159.html">testing the feature</a> in the US and elsewhere, Spotify has launched synchronized song lyrics for users around the world, the company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/">announced</a>. The new feature is coming to the &quot;majority&quot; of Spotify tracks for both free and premium users, and will be powered in-app by Musixmatch .&nbsp;</p><p>The feature will work across iOS and Android devices, desktop, TV and consoles. To use it, you tap on the &quot;Now Playing View&quot; on a song and swipe up from the bottom of the screen. From there, you&#39;ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time, along with a share button for social media.

The main Carrier Crusher product is a $100 annual plan designed for customers who use less than 10GB of data a month. It costs $100 a year and will give customers access to unlimited talk and text, as well as 1GB of high speed data. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-acquires-boost-mobile-wireless-carrier-171217646.html">Dish-owned</a> prepaid mobile carrier cited a couple of studies in its announcement, including one that found that 45 percent of Americans are paying for unlimited data, even though one in three use less than 5GB.</p><p>Stephen Stokols, CEO of Boost Mobile, said:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The US market is set up for the carriers to provide a high price point to all Americans today. It&#39;s great for the 15 percent of users who consume over 10 GB of data per month, but for the rest of us, we are subsidizing the bill for those users. You wouldn&#39;t pay $70 for an all you can eat buffet if you only wanted a salad, so why are we forced to choose all you can eat in wireless?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to the $100 annual plan, Boost has also launched a Carrier Crusher product with unlimited talk and text plus 15GB of data. It costs $20 a month, but customers will be billed annually. For those who prefer paying monthly, it now offers a $25 and a $15 plan with unlimited talk and text, as well as 5GB and 2G of data, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Dish <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-att-mobile-services-boost-ting-republic-wireless-t-mobile-151607721.html">struck a deal</a> with AT&amp;T back in July, paying the carrier at least $5 billion over 10 years to provide voice, data and messaging services to its Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless customers. Boost used to be Sprint&#39;s prepaid brand until the company had to spin it off as part of its merger with T-Mobile. Prior to its deal with AT&amp;T, Boost was entirely reliant on T-Mobile&#39;s network. However, the companies&#39; relationship soured when T-Mobile announced that it was shutting down the Sprint legacy network Boost is using on January 1st, 2022. Dish argued that the deadline doesn&#39;t give it enough time to migrate its customers, and T-Mobile ultimately agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-3g-cdma-shutdown-delay-151546831.html">move it</a> to March 31st next year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boost-mobile-carrier-crusher-plans-att-110008725.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10fe51db-8b18-4c83-9f8c-be19075ccdd5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 11:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637233178</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T10:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6b6ef790-f380-11eb-bfff-fbb6d36830ac" width="6980" height="4656" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6b6ef790-f380-11eb-bfff-fbb6d36830ac" width="6980" height="4656" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Inside Creative House via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cropped image of happy girl using smartphone device while chilling at home]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cropped image of happy girl using smartphone device while chilling at home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mattel arrives at the LA Motor Show with a life-size Barbie Extra EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What kid hasn&#39;t wished that their toy car was a full-sized road-going vehicle?

The 20- and 22-inch (front/rear) pink and rainbow-hued wheels were apparently 3D-printed and hand painted. The headlights are gold and star shaped, which, nice touch. Sure, the whole affair is designed to promote Mattel&#39;s lineup of Barbie Extra dolls and accessories, but it should make the auto show a bit more accessible for kids.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mattel-has-a-full-sized-barbie-car-at-the-la-auto-show-094036175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ee50824-cd50-4869-b253-2e6e0c617988</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 09:40:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637227127</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T09:18:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Toys]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ad2d35c0-4844-11ec-b3ff-a7722a5fcd6f" width="5359" height="3573" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ad2d35c0-4844-11ec-b3ff-a7722a5fcd6f" width="5359" height="3573" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PATRICK T.

That said, Scarlett isn&#39;t the only face of the movement. Most of the posts on the website are by Janneke Parrish, the other #AppleToo lead organizer who was fired by the company back in October. Apple fired its former program manager for allegedly sharing private information, something that Parrish <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2021/10/appletoo-organizer-didnt-expect-to-be-fired.html">denies</a>. When details of a company meeting were leaked to the press, Apple investigated Parrish and confiscated her work devices. She deleted some apps and work information before doing so, which Apple interpreted as being noncompliant with its investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from Scarlett, former Apple senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik also filed a complaint with the NLRB. She said she spent months talking to Apple about unsafe working conditions and sexism in the workplace and was put on indefinite paid administrative leave after raising her concerns.

There was a long laundry list of complaints: the series is too dark, everyone is mean, everyone cries too much, the Klingon designs suck, it shouldn’t be set before the original series, Michael Burnham is an unlikeable main character. While some changes have been made to the show over the years to smooth these rough edges, the elevation of Michael Burnham to the captain’s chair for season four has made it clear that <em>Discovery</em> is still largely going to do its own thing, regardless of what the fandom thinks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the past, season four for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek/">Star Trek</a> series has always been a turning point, the moment when a show finally figures out what it wants to be. Season four of <em>The Next Generation</em> started with the riveting “The Best of Both Worlds,” and produced a number of classic episodes like “Family,” “Clues” and “The Drumhead.” <em>Deep Space Nine</em> added Worf to its crew in its fourth year, while <em>Voyager</em> got Seven of Nine. <em>Enterprise</em>’s final season is generally considered its best. So fans were curious to see if the pattern would continue in the Kurtzman era of Trek.</p><div id="804a30d349da4581a95a3fb61d0f6a31"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIPT9WC6Vsk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Things certainly looked promising at the end of last season. The crew of <em>Discovery</em> had jumped 900 years into the future, to a galaxy where dilithium fuel for space travel was in short supply and the Federation was in tatters thanks to an event known as “The Burn.” Burnham and the rest of the <em>Discovery</em> crew figured out the source of the disaster and solved the problem in last year’s finale, opening the doors to a show dedicated to rebuilding the Federation and its ideals. After three seasons of war, it finally looked like the <em>USS Discovery</em> could finally get down to Starfleet’s long-stated mandates of science and exploration.</p><p>Season four begins five months after the previous episode, with the Federation now in high gear reaching out to old members and allies. That’s where we join the <em>USS Discovery</em>, as Burnham and Cleveland Booker are attempting to give a shipment of dilithium to a species new to the Star Trek audience. The mission quickly goes awry, strongly reminiscent of the madcap opening of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek Into Darkness" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/NKRxLN"><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em></a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f880180-47ea-11ec-bf9f-1b663cf552d4" alt="Pictured: David Ajala as Book and Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

They exhibit some of the excesses of modern Trek like an emphasis on frantic action and quippy dialogue — at least there’s less lens flare this time around. And everyone seems to be in a good mood, a contrast to when everyone was just worn down in the 23rd century by years of war and secret experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>The season opener is largely dedicated to showing off a new optimistic status quo, with Starfleet Academy being reestablished, Booker traveling to attend his nephew’s coming-of-age ritual and a new Federation president getting sworn in. It all seems rather staid, but Star Trek has always had its share of pomp and circumstance so it was actually a nice change of pace for the program. But things do go awry when the <em>Discovery</em> is tasked with rescuing a station crew and have to make a few hard choices, thus the title of the episode: “Kobayashi Maru.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/779510e0-47ea-11ec-acfe-7a455c2b4d2c" alt="Pictured: Mary Wiseman as Tilly of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

In the simulation, the cadets are faced with the choice of rescuing a ship stranded in enemy territory. To cross the border to rescue the craft is to risk war, but to preserve peace means to consign that crew to death. It’s been called a “no win” scenario,” and the Academy is interested in how a cadet reacts to it rather than the actual outcome. Kirk is known as the only person to have actually beaten it, because he reprogrammed the scenario; he cheated.</p><p>Like Kirk, Michael Burnham also doesn’t believe in the no-win scenario. She always does what she feels is best, and it’s made her crew unfailingly loyal to her over the past few seasons. But it’s earned her a share of detractors off-screen, because Burnham often disobeys orders and ignores good advice. She’s the rebel cop who plays by their own rules. Except this is Star Trek, a franchise about teamwork. Michael’s actions — and the fact that they always succeed — often undermine her superiors and even her own crewmates.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c20cf070-47ea-11ec-abf6-939c8320d357" alt="Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

But even then the show felt it needed some sort of conflict, bringing the Federation president along to question Michael’s judgment in front of her crew. I couldn’t help but be reminded of how before the show aired, the producers and writers were bragging about how they were going to break one of Gene Roddenberry’s key rules for the series: No inter-crew conflict. Watching that in action in this episode, however, was mildly uncomfortable and even a little embarrassing to see.</p><p>Not everything is rosy by the end of the adventure, but it’s still a better outcome than we’ve seen at the end of many Star Trek outings. But the new “happy” status quo is thrown out the door by an anomaly at the end of the episode. As seen in previews, this anomaly will be an ongoing concern for the <em>USS Discovery</em> and the entire Federation — not just as a threat to life, but as a threat to the Federation’s efforts to pull itself back together.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d2256b0-47eb-11ec-9b97-075806a2a5c6" alt="Pictured: Emily Coutts as Lt.

Fans who love “planet of the week” adventures and were hoping for the show to embrace that format will come away disappointed for now. However, while episodes one and two are involved in setup for the ongoing anomaly plot line, episodes three and four still make room for some vaguely one-shot adventures, albeit ones designed to further character development.</p><p>But while <em>Discovery</em> doesn’t seem all that interested in changing how it does things, the environment around it has changed. It’s no longer the only Star Trek show on TV, thanks to the premieres of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20picard/"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20lower%20decks/"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> in 2020, last month’s kid-oriented <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-episode-lost-and-found-070033462.html"><em>Prodigy</em></a> and the debut of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-paramount-plus-020913184.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a> next year. All of these shows tackle the Star Trek universe in their own way, and are not required viewing to understand what’s happening in other shows (though there are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html">some references to Picard</a> in the first episodes of <em>Discovery</em>). Viewers can choose the Trek that suits them best, removing the pressure from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Discovery" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/EaZn7n"><em>Discovery</em></a> to be all things to all fans and making it even easier to just do its own thing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-four-episode-one-premiere-080055200.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5b91bc3-9dd4-4e77-acf4-cdbb816c95ea</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637188853</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T22:41:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26b53f80-47e8-11ec-bab3-439d8be6ae78" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26b53f80-47e8-11ec-bab3-439d8be6ae78" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

The angular design language is a centerpiece, but the real highlight may be technology that, in some cases, eclipses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-officially-debuts-the-ev-6-awd-electric-crossover-080006032.html">the EV6</a>. For one, the cockpit is dominated by a single 27-inch display that covers both driver and passenger needs — it&#39;s not as huge as the Hyperscreen in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">Mercedes EQS</a>, but it&#39;s more expansive than the EV6&#39;s dual 12-inch panels.</p><p>You can also expect solid performance with up to 300 miles of range and 350kW charging that brings the Concept EV9 from a 10 percent charge to 80 percent in 30 minutes.

Apart from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-redesign-interior-221606865.html">yoke-like</a> wheel, the EV9 can turn into a social hub when it&#39;s stationary. A Pause mode turns the second row into a table and swings the front row to face the back, while Enjoy Mode pivots the third row and opens the tailgate for parties and marvelling at nature. You can also expect the obligatory eco-friendly materials like recycled fishnets (flooring), reused plastic bottles (seats) and a vegan leather interior.</p><p>Kia hasn&#39;t said how closely this might resemble a production EV9, although we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the company cuts the rotating seats, yoke and giant 22-inch wheels (among other frills) for any real-world model. The biggest question may be price. Kia sold its First Edition EV6 for $58,500, but that was a limited, maxed-out version. We&#39;d expect Kia to offer more aggressive prices if there is a shipping EV9, although the road-ready machine could easily cost more than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-2019-kia-niro-ev-review.html">Niro EV</a>.</p><div id="6628a569ec1b4731860aa4f941787262"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1klApgPyB4?start=740" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kia-concept-ev9-electric-suv-221504011.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9404f295-3d4f-44f8-8108-1e055eb430b0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:15:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637241979</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T13:26:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b1462bf0-47ed-11ec-b5ed-a2a2cb504771" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b1462bf0-47ed-11ec-b5ed-a2a2cb504771" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kia Concept EV9 electric SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kia Concept EV9 electric SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Streamlabs drops 'OBS' from its app name after plagiarism complaints]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-accused-of-copying-lightstream-obs-140742760.html">accusations of plagiarism and copycat naming schemes</a>, <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> has announced that it&#39;s removing &quot;OBS&quot; from the name of its popular livestreaming app. At first glance, the move is a direct response to the developers behind <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcasting Software</a> (OBS), who claimed that Streamlabs used their naming scheme against their wishes.

It also offers premium services on top of its free core app, so you could argue that Streamlabs was partially fueling its business based on OBS&#39;s popularity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-drops-obs-name-livestreaming-215852461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b3821f2-af48-4960-bdb3-e52e46ad5a0a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:58:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637186334</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T21:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1788b820-47ed-11ec-ba7f-4abb4506fe6d" width="5357" height="3514" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1788b820-47ed-11ec-ba7f-4abb4506fe6d" width="5357" height="3514" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 11: In this illustration photo logo of Streamlabs is displayed on a smartphone and a pc screen in Ankara, Turkey on May 11, 2021.

The notification will direct those individuals to use the company’s mainline app to continue chatting with their friends. When Instagram discontinues support for Threads, it will remove the software from the App Store and Google Play. It will also log users out of the experience.</p><p>It’s not a surprise to see Threads join the Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html"><ins>formerly Facebook</ins></a>) graveyard.

What’s more, Meta’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-facebook-unifying-instagram-whatsapp.html"><ins>messaging ambitions</ins></a> have evolved significantly since the app’s debut.

The brand has <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3446">revealed</a> its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-seven-concept-204540273.html">previously-teased</a> &quot;Seven&quot; concept EV, and it&#39;s built for an era when you might only occasionally take the helm. The SUV centers on a lounge-like interior where the driver&#39;s control stick retracts in autonomous mode, letting them and their passengers socialize thanks to two swivelling chairs and an L-shaped chaise. There&#39;s even a mini fridge, shoe refreshers and a panoramic screen that offers entertainment or ambiance.</p><p>The Seven&#39;s designers also took greater advantage of the liberties an electric vehicle offers. In addition to using the flat floor for a lounge, Hyundai pushed the wheelbase to a lengthy 10.5 feet without increasing the overall size. You&#39;ll also find a low leading hood edge and a &quot;streamlined&quot; roof. EVs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">live or die on aerodynamics</a>, and the company promised an aerodynamically &quot;pure&quot; body despite the SUV profile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8cd8df6a3b3546f48951ee55295899f4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6ZiGk3KW0I?start=601" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>This is also clearly a pandemic-era concept. The airflow system borrows from airliners with horizontal and vertical modes that reduce cross-contamination and otherwise protect hygiene. You&#39;ll find UVC lights that sterilize the environment once passengers leave, including storage.</p><p>And yes, this is actually a moving car. Hyundai is hoping for a range over 300 miles, and offers 350kW charging that brings the Seven from a 10 percent charge to 80 percent in roughly 20 minutes.</p><p>Hyundai makes it very clear this is a concept you won&#39;t buy. It does serve as a preview of a future electric SUV, though, so you can expect a more conservative take that joins the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a> in the company&#39;s expanding EV lineup.

Publisher Victura has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-17-six-days-in-fallujah-delayed-to-late-2022">confirmed</a> the first-person shooter will be delayed until the last quarter of 2022. Previously, it targeted a 2021 launch window.</p><p>Victura and Highwire Games, which counts former Destiny and Halo developers among its team, announced in February that they are reviving the game. <em>Six Days in Fallujah</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-04-06-konami-announces-six-days-in-fallujah-game-based-on-real-batt.html">first emerged in 2009</a>, but following a backlash, publisher Konami backed out and developer Atomic Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-08-06-atomic-games-unable-to-secure-funding-for-six-days-in-fallujah.html">wasn&#39;t able to secure funding</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-16-atomic-games-still-wants-to-finish-six-days-in-fallujah.html">finish the game</a>. The studio shut down in 2011 and the project, then a third-person shooter, was shelved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game features true stories shared by dozens of marines, soldiers and Iraqi civilians who were involved in Second Battle of Fallujah in Iraq in November 2004. Missions take place from the perspective of a person who was there, and they&#39;ll provide narration about what happened, from their point of view.</p><p>As was the case the first time around, critics rallied against <em>Six Days in Fallujah</em>. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a prominent Muslim advocacy group in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-08-playstation-xbox-called-on-to-drop-six-days-in-fallujah">urged</a> Sony, Microsoft and Valve to block it from their gaming platforms.</p><p>Victura CEO Peter Tamte, formerly of Atomic and Destiny studio Bungie, was widely denounced for suggesting the game would not make a political statement regarding why American soldiers were in Fallujah. The publisher later <a href="https://www.sixdays.com/news/a-word-about-politics">clarified</a> that &quot;we understand the events recreated in <em>Six Days in Fallujah </em>are inseparable from politics.&quot;</p><p>Despite the black cloud hanging over the game, Victura and Highwire <a href="https://www.sixdays.com/news/2022">are forging ahead</a>. They plan to almost double the size of the development team. “It became clear that recreating these true stories at a high quality was going to require more people, capital and time than we had,” Tamte said. “Doubling our team is just one of many things we’re doing to make sure <em>Six Days in Fallujah </em>brings new kinds of tactical and emotional depth to military shooters.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/six-days-in-fallujah-delayed-205533283.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb456f46-f445-4a12-a78d-e947d4c2f3af</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:10:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637181707</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T20:41:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/037dc2f0-47e1-11ec-b6fb-f01e9760a6f4" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/037dc2f0-47e1-11ec-b6fb-f01e9760a6f4" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Victura/Highwire Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Six Days in Fallujah]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Six Days in Fallujah]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fisker will start producing its Ocean electric SUV in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After building hype for several years, Fisker says it’s nearly ready to bring its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-fisker-ocean-pricing.html">Ocean</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-fisker-ocean-pricing.html">SUV</a> to market. At the Los Angeles motor show, the automaker unveiled a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/cghen8gr8e1n/KY4dEPpu6okyU8EJyXwVF/4e36b5aabdc08e96e31047a0c8b0ccaa/Fisker_Ocean_LAAS_Press_Release_-_FINAL.pdf">production-intent</a> variant of the all-electric vehicle and said it planned to begin pilot production this week at a Magna-Steyr facility in Austria. According to Fisker, full-scale manufacturing will start a year from now, with deliveries following shortly thereafter.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-fisker-ocean-pricing.html">previously announced</a>, the Ocean will start at $37,499 in the US before federal- and state-level subsidies. Fisker will offer the SUV in two additional trims. It will sell the Ocean Ultra for $49,999 and the Ocean Extreme for $68,999. The base-level Sport model features a single 275 horsepower motor capable of accelerating the car from zero to 60 miles per hour in 6.6 seconds. Meanwhile, the dual-motor Ultra model features a total output of 540 horsepower, allowing it to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds. The slightly more powerful Extreme can complete that feat in 3.6 seconds thanks to its 550 horsepower powertrain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fisker has yet to share the exact battery capacities of each model but estimates the Sport trim will have the ability to go 250 miles on a single charge. On the top end, the Extreme variant will feature a 350-mile range. The Extreme model will also come with a solar roof that Fisker says can add up to 2000 miles of range. Inside the cabin, the Ocean has an all-vegan interior made from recycled fishing nets, old t-shirts and renewed rubber. Another nifty addition is a 17.1-inch touchscreen display that can rotate between portrait and landscape orientations.</p><p>With a year before the Ocean starts making its way to consumers, there’s still a long wait before the SUV arrives. However, once it does arrive, the Ocean will be available for sale globally.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fisker-ocean-production-22-204310175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ef5060b3-a2a9-4a70-94a8-bf6c1d23d360</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 20:43:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637242006</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T13:26:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec3e46f0-47e5-11ec-aedf-ac3eb0d5ef9a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec3e46f0-47e5-11ec-aedf-ac3eb0d5ef9a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fisker]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fisker Ocean]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fisker Ocean]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Headspace gives US teens free access to its mental health app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/headspace-new-york-state-of-mind-website-205305471.html">offering free mental health exercises </a>at the beginning of the pandemic, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace " href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace </a>has announced that it&#39;s opening up its service for free to a particularly vulnerable group for mental stressors: teens.

In an email obtained by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/playstation-chief-criticizes-activision-response-to-allegations"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Sony Interactive CEO Jim Ryan critiqued Activision’s response to the article. Ryan linked Sony employees to the report, and said he was “disheartened and frankly stunned to read” <em>The Journal’s</em> findings.</p><p>“We outreached to Activision immediately after the article was published to express our deep concern and to ask how they plan to address the claims made in the article,” Ryan says in the message. “We do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As the company that makes the PlayStation 4 and PS5, Sony is one of Activision’s most important partners. Their close relationship is highlighted by the fact Sony has first dibs on some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-15-playstation-is-the-new-home-of-call-of-duty-first-with-beta-a.html"><em>Call of Duty</em> content</a>. The fact Ryan’s email leaked shouldn’t come as a surprise given that it was an all-hands message.</p><p>Broadly,<em> The Wall Street Journal </em>report claims Kotick was not only aware of many of the allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment at the company, but that he may have also intervened to protect some of its worst offenders, and that he mistreated women himself. In a statement to Engadget, a spokesperson for the publisher said the article presents a “misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO.” Shortly after it started circulating widely on social media, Blizzard employees announced they would stage a walkout. Hours later, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116006294/en/Activision-Blizzard-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Recent-Article">issued a statement</a> expressing its continued support of Kotick’s leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a report published by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/culture/activision-blizzard-doubles-down-on-kotick-defense-in-all-hands-meeting"><em>Game Developer</em></a>, Activision Blizzard also defended Kotick during an all-hands meeting the company hosted after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published its report. When asked if its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html">zero-tolerance policy</a> would apply to the executive, the company told employees it did not &quot;have evidence&quot; of the claims against Kotick due to the fact they relate to an incident that happened a decade ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 3:49PM ET</strong>: Added information from <em>Game Developer</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jim-ryan-email-activision-blizzard-195248273.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bbbc4611-f15d-4fa4-a2b4-e00203d93a20</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 19:52:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637182516</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T20:55:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4d66e1f0-47df-11ec-bc7f-b7696bdf337b" width="5000" height="3696" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4d66e1f0-47df-11ec-bc7f-b7696bdf337b" width="5000" height="3696" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man carrying a sign accusing Activision Blizzard CEO Robert A.

Many TikTok challenges are harmless and fun. Others are riskier, such as this year&#39;s milk crate challenge, which led to a spate of injuries. But well-intentioned parents and other adults who want to warn others about dangerous challenges can inadvertently raise awareness of them — even if those challenges are fake.</p><p>The company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-our-community-stay-safe-while-having-fun-on-tiktok">commissioned a survey</a> of more than 10,000 teens, parents and teachers in several countries, including the US and UK. It found that 31 percent of teens had taken part in some kind of online challenge.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Teens were asked about the risk level of a challenge they&#39;d seen online recently, not necessarily on TikTok. Around 48 percent said the challenge was safe, 32 percent said it had a little risk and 14 percent described it as risky or dangerous. Respondents said three percent of challenges were &quot;very dangerous,&quot; while 0.3 percent said they&#39;d taken part in a challenge they categorized in that way.</p><p>The study found that 46 percent of teens want more information and help to understand the risks of challenges, while 31 percent said they &quot;felt a negative impact&quot; from hoaxes related to self harm and suicide. Recognizing and dealing with hoaxes isn&#39;t necessarily easy. Thirty-seven percent of the adult respondents say they find it difficult to discuss self-harm and suicide hoaxes without drawing attention to them.</p><p>TikTok says it already removes hoaxes and takes action to limit their spread, but it&#39;s planning to do more. It will take down &quot;alarmist warning&quot; videos about fake self-harm challenges. &quot;The research showed how warnings about self-harm hoaxes — even if shared with the best of intentions — can impact the well-being of teens since they often treat the hoax as real,&quot; TikTok said. &quot;We will continue to allow conversations to take place that seek to dispel panic and promote accurate information.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-05-adults-only-ones-fooled-momo-challenge-hoax.html"><ins>Momo Challenge</ins></a>, for instance, was an infamous viral hoax that a lot of people fell for a couple of years ago. Its spread was exacerbated by those sounding the alarm about the &quot;challenge,&quot; which many falsely claimed was urging kids to harm themselves.</p><p>Other safety improvements TikTok has made include expanding &quot;technology that helps alert our safety teams to sudden increases in violating content linked to hashtags.&quot; Whenever a user searches for content linked to a hoax or dangerous challenge, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-will-warn-users-in-search-results-for-distressing-content-120042064.html">they&#39;ll see a warning label</a>.</p><p>The company worked with a clinical child psychiatrist and a behavioral scientist to improve the language of the label. Users who search for hoaxes and harmful challenges will be encouraged to visit TikTok&#39;s Safety Center to learn about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/online-challenges/"><ins>how to recognize them</ins></a>. If the search is connected to a hoax linked to suicide or self harm, they&#39;ll see resources such as contact details for the National Suicide Prevention Helpline.</p><p><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Crisis Text Line can be reached by texting HOME to 741741 (US), 686868 (Canada), or 85258 (UK).

The streaming music service has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-17/j-abrams-bad-robot-forges-new-audio-division-in-collaboration-with-spotify/">struck</a> a multi-year deal that gives it &quot;first look&quot; access to podcasts from J.J. Abrams&#39; new Bad Robot Audio unit. The move lets Spotify snap up exclusives from Bad Robot&#39;s planned mix of fiction and non-fiction shows.</p><p>Bad Robot Audio hasn&#39;t yet detailed its releases, but it will have an experienced leader. Christina Choi will helm the new outfit after directing content partnerships at Audible, and before that a creative development executive at Spotify. She played an important role in Spotify&#39;s early podcast efforts, and is unsurprisingly eager to collaborate with her former employer in her field of expertise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move could be a coup for Spotify if Bad Robot&#39;s podcast group fares as well as its better-known video team. Spotify has numerous major exclusives from narrowly-focused partners like WWE, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-06-spotify-barack-michelle-obama-podcast-higher-ground.html">the Obamas</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/armchair-expert-podcast-spotify-exclusive-dax-shepard-180052195.html">Dax Shepard</a>, but alliances with general studios on this level are decidedly less common. This arrangement might produce top shows in a wider variety of genres, and could include some well-known voices in the bargain.</p><p>For Bad Robot, this is part of a broader expansion into the digital realm. J.J. Abrams&#39; company has been shifting toward <a href="https://www.engadget.com/batman-caped-crusader-jj-abrams-hbo-max-143618065.html">streaming shows</a>, and last year branched out to gaming with Bad Robot Games. There&#39;s a clear effort to create a media empire that reaches well beyond conventional video, and podcasts represent a significant next step.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-bad-robot-audio-jj-abrams-podcasts-182214760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43e8b833-d4af-4f88-8a7f-be9a4b191967</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 18:22:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637175311</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T18:55:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c576f110-47d7-11ec-bb5d-214072eb220f" width="3712" height="2474" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c576f110-47d7-11ec-bb5d-214072eb220f" width="3712" height="2474" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[J.J.

While the feature is still in beta, it’s now available to select Xbox console owners in <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions"><ins>25 markets</ins></a>. Over the coming weeks, the company plans to scale the service to all Xbox systems in those regions. As before, you’ll need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription to use the service, but it’s no longer necessary to take part in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Insider programs.</p><p>Microsoft envisions a handful of scenarios where the ability to stream a game will be helpful. To start, it’s a way for people to try a Game Pass title without downloading it first. In much the same way, it also allows you to jump into a multiplayer game with your friends, even if you don’t have that title installed. Lastly, for Xbox One owners, it’s a chance to play Xbox Series X/S titles like <em>The Medium</em> and <em>The Riftbreaker</em>. For the best possible experience, you’ll still want to download your favorite games to your console. You’ll know if you can stream a Game Pass title if it has a cloud icon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7717a823-0544-40ef-b2b7-dc61b1d6c279</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 18:03:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637172282</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T18:04:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3916b760-1faf-11eb-ac6f-2e9f202b4a1b" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3916b760-1faf-11eb-ac6f-2e9f202b4a1b" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jessica Conditt / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox Series S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox Series S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is replacing Windows Media Player with Media Player for Windows 11]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has built a new media playback app for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> to supplant both Windows Media Player, which hasn&#39;t really changed since 2009, and the Groove Music app. Windows Insiders can <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/16/new-media-player-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">start testing</a> the creatively named Media Player for Windows 11 now.</p><p>The app is designed for both music and video playback.

During playback, you&#39;ll see album art and &quot;rich artist imagery&quot; in both full screen and mini-player modes. The app will add files from your PC&#39;s music and video folders too. Through the settings, users can tell Media Player where else to look for things to bring to the library.</p><p>There are accessibility-focused options in the app too. Microsoft says those include &quot;improved keyboard shortcut and access key support for keyboard users and with other assistive technologies.&quot;</p><p>Media Player currently has a couple of issues, Microsoft notes, including ones that affect playback from some network locations, editing album metadata and library content with accented characters. You&#39;ll still be able to access the old version of Windows Media Player through Windows Tools.</p><p>Of course, the Media Player design reflects the clean aesthetic of Windows 11.

It&#39;s a bit of a shame that Microsoft chose such a boring name for the new app, but at least users shouldn&#39;t be confused about what it does.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-media-player-windows-11-microsoft-music-video-174907728.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb71a266-93ce-41d5-a7e2-028cd63b3d57</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 17:49:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637171251</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T17:47:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1f58c80-47cb-11ec-bcdf-cc672e8cf68f" width="2152" height="1491" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1f58c80-47cb-11ec-bcdf-cc672e8cf68f" width="2152" height="1491" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot showing music playback in the Media Player for Windows 11 app, with including album art.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Media Player for Windows 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nissan starts taking reservations for its $46,000 Ariya crossover EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nissan is finally ready to offer pricing and other tangible details for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-electric-car-ariya-052306996.html">electric Ariya crossover</a>. The automaker has <a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/reservations-now-open-for-all-new-2023-nissan-ariya-electric-crossover">started</a> taking <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/ariya/reserve/venture+">reservations</a> for the Ariya beginning at $45,950 for the Venture+ model. That&#39;s more than the $40,000 ballpark from before, but still brings the price down to $38,450 with a federal tax credit. The Venture+ may be the best model for long drives, too. You&#39;ll have only a 238HP motor with front wheel drive, but you&#39;ll get the longest estimated range at 300 miles. The higher-capacity 87kWh battery is standard on all currently announced models.</p><p>The $48,950 Evolve+ builds on that formula with an &quot;around view&quot; monitor and a powered moonroof, albeit with a shorter 285-mile range. The reservation-only Premiere trim starts at $53,450, but gives you access to the Ariya&#39;s signature &quot;Sunrise Copper&quot; color, hands-off highway driving from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-nissan-skyline-propilot-2-driver-assist.html">ProPilot Assist 2.0</a> and ProPilot Park. If you want all-wheel drive, you&#39;ll currently have to splurge on the $58,950 Platinum+ variant with 389HP, a hands-free liftgate, Nappa leather and a reduced 265-mile range.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All models are due to arrive in fall 2022. You&#39;ll need to place a $500 refundable deposit and choose a preferred dealer, but you can complete the final purchase online and have the Ariya delivered to your home. You won&#39;t have to wade through the usual hassles of in-person dealership sales.</p><p>The price slots the Ariya between the $39,995 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and Tesla&#39;s Model Y (currently $58,990), with the in-between range and features to match. It may face tough competition as a result. However, that might be the precise appeal — this is a middle-of-the-road EV from a well-known badge. Where the Leaf was aimed at early adopters (and lately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissans-entry-level-leaf-is-now-the-cheapest-ev-in-the-us-at-27400-053932185.html">the cost-conscious</a>), the Ariya promises to be a thoroughly mainstream vehicle that reaches more first-time EV owners and helps Nissan electrify the rest of its lineup.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nissan-ariya-ev-price-reservations-171536739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52e25066-f688-4efc-b56f-3728da49893a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 17:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637180395</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T20:19:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/525304d0-47c3-11ec-bbcf-7128c79ae7af" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/525304d0-47c3-11ec-bbcf-7128c79ae7af" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nissan]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nissan 2023 Ariya electric crossover SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nissan 2023 Ariya electric crossover SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
