That&#39;s something Barry&#39;s did with its <a href="https://www.barrys.com/barrysathome/">At Home program</a>, and now it&#39;s building on that work with the release of a new app called <a href="https://barrysx.com/">Barry&#39;s X</a>.  Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Apple Fitness+</a>, Peloton and Daily Burn, you can use the software to access live and on-demand workouts. But in trying to replicate the in-person experience it&#39;s known for, you can also turn on your phone&#39;s camera and a built-in &quot;Red Room&quot; filter during a class. Barry&#39;s says the feature will allow its instructors to offer personalized attention.&nbsp;</p><p>In-app privacy settings allow you to control who sees you when you&#39;re on camera. You can set it so only your instructor can access your feed. It&#39;s also possible to include your friends in the mix. And if you&#39;re the type of person who wants to show off, you can let the whole class see you. The company says it will also cap class sizes to ensure instructors can help every participant.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside of the camera feature, the app includes a &quot;FitFam&quot; social media component where you can add friends to see their schedules and stats, as well as invite them to classes you want to try. Pricing will depend on how much you plan to use the app. Monthly memberships <a href="https://www.barrys.com/barrys-x-faq/">start at $39</a>. The entry-level package includes access to four classes every 30 days. If you already pay for an in-studio membership, you can buy a $20 add-on that gives you access to the app&#39;s on-demand content. Another option is to pay for classes individually, though that will set you back $20 per session.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/barrys-x-fitness-app-054517166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b65914f5-4f7c-44e7-bba6-da82aae22a32</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 05:45:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569964</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:32:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30a8d740-f955-11eb-bfda-3b13c0f79e1d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30a8d740-f955-11eb-bfda-3b13c0f79e1d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barry's]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Barry's X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Barry's X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's new 5-nanometer chip is designed for smartwatches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-the-industrys-first-5nm-processor-powering-the-next-generation-of-wearables">unveiled</a> the Exynos W920, a new processor designed specifically for smartphones and wearables.

The new slate of writers includes  Saladin Ahmed, Jonathan Hickman, Molly Ostertag, Scott Snyder and James Tynion IV, with other writers and artists to be announced at a later date.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other Substack writers, comics creators will send their work out in a newsletter format and charge subscribers directly for their work. During the first year, they&#39;ll be paid by Substack which will take most of the subscription revenue, and after that, the platform will take a 10 percent cut. Creators will retain ownership of all their materials.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tynion IV, who recently won the Eisner award for his work on DC&#39;s <em>Batman</em> and other titles, said he&#39;ll work on Substack exclusively. &quot;This wasn’t an easy decision,&quot; he told the <em>NY Times</em>. &quot;In order to invest my time in new material, I needed to choose. I could not do both.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>DC had presented me with a three-year renewal of my exclusive contract, with the intent of me working on Batman for the bulk of that time. I was grateful of the offer, but I couldn’t help but look at the success of my original, creator owned titles and wonder if it was the right choice.</p></blockquote><p>Substack first got into comics back in June when it signed Marvel&#39;s <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> writer Nick Spencer. Spencer reportedly spearheaded the idea and was the liaison between Substack and newly signed creators. On top of comic book stories, they&#39;ll publish, essays, how-to guides and other content on the platform.</p><p>Until recently, Substack has mostly focused on newsletters covering politics, technology and more. Comics, meanwhile, have been around forever on the web, but have largely been funded by ads and merchandise sales. By joining with Substack, creators will be able to engage directly with readers in a model that more closely resembles comic book sales.&nbsp;</p><p>In his Substack <a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era">launch post</a>, Tynion said that he effectively turned down a three-year renewal of his DC Batman contract when Substack signed him &quot;to create a new slate of original comic book properties directly on their platform, that my co-creators and I would own completely,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I’m going to dedicate my whole brain to building a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms, without having to get permission from any publisher to make it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/substack-signs-a-slate-of-big-name-comics-creators-042310705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c2076b1-2951-485b-bed3-36bb179b84a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:23:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569389</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:23:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Visual Arts]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Avon Oeming]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Parallels 17 promises better M1 Mac performance and Windows 11 support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Parallels, the company best know for its virtualization software that lets you run Windows and Linux directly on your Mac, has had a busy year. In addition to building a version of Parallels that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-chromebook-running-windows-10-170015389.html">run on Chrome OS</a> for the first time, the company also had to figure out how to quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-m1-mac-native-virtual-machine-144526933.html">make its software work with the new, ARM-based M1 Macs</a> that arrived last fall. Now, Parallels Desktop 17 is being released with improved performance on M1 Macs, as well as full support for the upcoming macOS Monterey and Windows 11 operating systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Before getting into these improvements, though, it&#39;s worth taking a moment to talk compatibility. Apple moving the Mac to ARM architecture means there are now two classes of Macs for Parallels to support. As of today, the only versions of Windows that Parallels can run on an M1 Mac are the Insider Previews for Windows 10 and Windows 11 — because those versions of the OS are able to run on ARM-based hardware. But, Parallels unequivocally says that when the full version of Windows 11 is released to the public, it&#39;ll run on Parallels 17.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On an Intel-baed Mac, however, users can still run a host of virtual machines, including Windows support all the way back to XP and Windows 2000, and macOS all the way back to 2011&#39;s OS X Lion. It can also run eight different Linux distros; M1 Macs can only virtualize four right now, including Ubuntu and Fedora.</p><p>So while Intel Macs still offer the broadest compatibility, Parallels has found that the raw power of the M1 chip means users likely aren&#39;t giving anything up running the Windows 10 or 11 Insider Previews. Microsoft&#39;s built-in emulation for Windows means that Windows 10 Insider Preview can run almost any 32-bit x86 app as well as &quot;many&quot; 64-bit x86 apps, and the M1&#39;s power helps to make up for speed lost due to emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what&#39;s new, Parallels has speed improvements across the board, whether you&#39;re running Intel or M1. Regardless of which system you&#39;re using, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38 percent faster, while OpenGL graphics run up to six times faster than the previous version. M1-specific speed improvements include 20 percent faster disk performance when using Windows 10 Insider preview, while DirectX graphics should perform up to 28 percent better. These tests are all run by Parallels, and we can&#39;t verify them yet, but improving performance has long been a focus for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a handful of new features on board, as well. Parallels improved its &quot;Coherence&quot; mode, where you can run a Windows app without launching into the full Windows UI. Now, things like shutdowns, updates and sign-in screens are windowed as well, making them easier to pop into the background. The ability to drag and drop between Windows and Mac apps has been improved, as well — for example, you can now highlight and drop text and images between Mac and Windows apps, and it&#39;ll work with the new Quick Note feature coming to macOS Monterey.&nbsp;</p><p>Parallels 17 also contains a virtual TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, which lets the system use BitLocker and Secure Boot when running Windows 10 and Windows 11. There&#39;s an added layer of intrigue to this feature: Microsoft originally said that a computer with a TPM chip was a requirement for Windows 11 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">before backtracking</a> (at least for the testing period). It&#39;s not clear yet if the final version of Windows 11 will require a TPM chip, but this virtualization should let Parallels users get around this requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>As with most software these days, Parallels Desktop 17 is being sold as a subscription. The standard edition is $79.99 per year, and the pro edition costs $99.99 per year. If you&#39;re on a subscription, you&#39;ll get Parallels updates as long as the subscription is active. If you prefer, though, you can get a perpetual license of the standard edition Parallels 17 for $99.99; people who have purchased a past perpetual license can upgrade for $49.99.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-17-m-1-mac-performance-windows-11-support-040128211.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e066b1b9-9226-4a38-910b-a12c18d77ac1</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:01:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628554066</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T00:07:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Parallels]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony closes $1.175 billion deal to buy Crunchyroll from AT&T]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s official.

In newly unsealed court documents, the two companies say the fraudsters made knockoffs of some of GoPro&#39;s most popular accessories that blatantly used its branding to try and trick potential buyers.</p><p>Among the products the counterfeiters saw to pass off as authentic include GoPro&#39;s signature &quot;3-Way&quot; and &quot;The Handler&quot; grips. The knockoffs were often hard to spot, with subtle differences between them and their real GoPro counterparts. For instance, some had foam handles that were a slightly different color from the one you&#39;ll find on tripods from the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;When counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they not only violate the intellectual property rights of companies like GoPro, they also mislead consumers and harm Amazon&#39;s reputation as a place to buy authentic goods,&quot; said Kebharu Smith, director of Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-095555911.html">recently formed Counterfeit Crimes Unit</a>.</p><p>Amazon and GoPro aren&#39;t the first companies to take legal action against fraudsters using the platform to sell counterfeit goods.

In 2020, the company says less than 0.01 percent of all products sold on its marketplace were the subject of a counterfeit complaint from customers. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617120/amazon-gopro-fakes-counterfeit-lawsuit-china-criminal-investigation"><em>The Verge </em>points out</a>, what we don&#39;t know is how many items the company sold last year.</p><p>At the scale Amazon does business, 0.01 percent could represent tens of thousands of complaints. It&#39;s also not clear how many people bought a counterfeit product, and either didn&#39;t think to contact the company about their purchase or were none the wiser about what they had in their possession. Either way, the issue of fake GoPro products was pressing enough for Amazon to team up with the company to take it on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-gopro-lawsuit-chinese-counterfeiters-204605084.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc95c6c7-e04c-444c-982d-f71bedf3eb96</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 20:46:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628541970</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:49:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ef45470-f951-11eb-9fef-70d495d96acd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ef45470-f951-11eb-9fef-70d495d96acd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GoPro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GoPro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UN report says most climate change effects are 'unprecedented' and 'irreversible']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s no longer possible to prevent the planet from heating over the next 20 to 30 years, and some of the changes global warming is bringing about are now impossible to undo in the short term, according to a<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/"> new report</a> from the United Nations&#39; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The document represents the most comprehensive analysis of the physical science behind climate change ever amassed in human history. The 284 scientists who worked on the project spent eight years examing data from more than 14,000 studies. They say human activity is &quot;unequivocally&quot; behind the Earth&#39;s rapidly changing climate.</p><p>Since the mid-19th century, the planet&#39;s temperature has increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, as a direct result of greenhouse gas emissions related to humans burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels for energy. We&#39;ve already seen the effects a warmer planet can have on humans. It was only earlier this summer that parts of Canada and the US Pacific Northwest suffered through a sweltering and unprecedented heatwave that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads">melted power cables, buckled roads</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/canada-heatwave-500-deaths">killed people</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion — such as continued sea level rise — are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years,&quot; the IPCC said.</p><div id="2cbdcd3b3154470ba12a0da665c084a2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These extreme events will only become more drastic in the future – this is why we cannot wait.

With a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html">1.5 degree Celsius</a> increase in global temperatures, there will be more frequent and life-threatening heat waves, droughts that leave millions struggling to find water and continued sea level rise that will displace coastal communities across the globe.</p><p>&quot;We can expect a significant jump in extreme weather over the next 20 or 30 years,&quot; Piers Forster, one of the climate scientists who contributed to the report, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. &quot;Things are unfortunately likely to get worse than they are today.&quot;</p><p>Reiterating past UN reports, the IPCC also warned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-2020-202805921.html">3 degree or even 4 degree Celsius increase</a> in global temperatures would be catastrophic. With every additional degree of warming, there&#39;s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even more dramatic changes to the climate. According to the IPCC, drastic reductions in emissions can limit the worse effects of climate change and keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, it could take between 20 to 80 years to see global temperatures stabilize.</p><p>The report will be front and center when diplomats travel to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the UN&#39;s <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26 summit</a> on climate change. As one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases globally, the US can play a significant role in what happens next.

Many sous vide machines cost hundreds of dollars, but those looking to give the method a go don&#39;t have to spend that much now thanks to a new sale on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano" href="https://amzn.to/3s3XQ58">Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano</a>.

The method involves cooking food in a sealable bag that&#39;s submerged in heated water. The Precision Cooker Nano and other devices like it constantly circulate the water and keep it at the right temperature, ensuring your food is never over- or undercooked.</p><p>The Nano is the entry-level machine in Anova&#39;s lineup, making it the right pick for sous vide newbies. It uses 750 watts of power to heat up water and it&#39;ll run for up to 3,000 hours before it needs to be recharged. With that amount of power, you&#39;ll be able to easily cook meals for up to four people.</p><p>Aside from wattage and battery capacity, it differs from the more advanced devices in Anova&#39;s lineup in its clamp and connectivity. It has a fixed clamp, rather than a removable and adjustable one, that you&#39;ll use to secure the machine to your cooking pot. It also connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth rather than WiFi, but that still gives you access to the customizable controls in the Anova mobile app. You can set the cooking time and keep track of your cook while it&#39;s cooking in the app, plus the app gives you access to a bunch of recipes you can try, too. While it may be tempting to spring for the standard, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$199 Precision Cooker" href="https://amzn.to/3Cqbmox">$199 Precision Cooker</a> for it extra power and battery life, the Nano is arguably the best choice for home cooks who want to give a new method a try without spending too much money upfront.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anova-precision-cooker-nano-sous-vide-machine-deal-99-amazon-best-buy-143302550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">604feb9b-774f-40fd-acd3-fb22cd0c388d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 14:33:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628519412</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T14:30:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b665470-f918-11eb-bbee-5d55a51b70a8" width="1645" height="1311" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b665470-f918-11eb-bbee-5d55a51b70a8" width="1645" height="1311" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anova]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anova Precision Cooker Nano]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anova Precision Cooker Nano]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renault and China's Geely will form a hybrid-focused joint venture in Asia]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/renault"><ins>Renault</ins></a> is looking to revive flagging sales in China.

The Show 5 remains a handy nightstand companion, with solid sound quality for the money and a 2MP camera for video chats with family (there&#39;s a physical privacy shutter). The Show 8, meanwhile, has both strong sound quality and a 13MP wide-angle camera that can track you as you walk around. It may hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re looking for a kitchen display that will help you chat with friends while you cook dinner.</p><p>The same catches remain.

The Echo Show isn&#39;t for you if you want to revisit <em>Loki</em> or <em>Hacks</em>. Amazon still has a very robust smart home ecosystem, though, and the wide range of Alexa skills could be helpful if you ever need a specialized voice app.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kids-frames-sale-140208954.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">863b70ca-efec-4aac-9e8d-c42908217758</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 14:02:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515884</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nicole Lee/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Beats Studio Buds drop to a new record low of $130]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While leaks somewhat spoiled their launch, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats&#39; Studio Buds" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Beats&#39; Studio Buds</a> impressed us with their comfortable new design, balanced sound and seamless pairing with both Android and iOS devices. They were priced right, too, coming in at $150. But now the buds are on sale for the first time since they came out in June, so you can grab them for only $130 from Amazon. All three colors have been discounted, so you can choose your favorite and save $20.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the Beats Studio Buds a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html#callquality">score of 84</a> and we consider them to be the best pair of Beats buds for most people. They have a smaller, more comfortable design that some past Beats earbuds and their IPX4 water-resistant housing will keep them safe even during your sweatiest workouts. The buds pump out good sound with punchy bass and they work with Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature, too. You&#39;re also getting noise-cancellation that uses adaptive gain control to adjust in real time, blocking out distracting noises like that from dishwashers, wind and more. As far as battery life goes, the Studio Buds should get five to eight hours on a single charge, depending on your ANC use.</p><p>You may think that because these are Beats earbuds that they&#39;re designed with Apple users in mind, first and foremost. However, Beats added a number of new features that make these buds better for Android users, too. They still have the H1 chip inside, so you&#39;ll get fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. But Android users also have a Fast Pair feature now, too, which allows Android devices to immediately recognize the buds during the initial setup. The Studio Buds work with Android&#39;s Find My Device feature, so you can use that to see the last known location of your buds.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot to like about the Beats Studio Buds, especially at this $130 sale price. However, they lack a few key features: wireless charging, onboard volume controls and sound customizations. We also weren&#39;t impressed with their call quality either. But if you&#39;re willing to sacrifice in those areas, the Studio Buds remain solid options for both Android and iOS users who want a reliable, comfortable pair of wireless earbuds that won&#39;t break the bank.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-sale-130-amazon-133550651.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d33aed58-67d5-44c5-a458-1b77ee658b70</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515867</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds have a design with more universal appeal than its Powerbeats Pro.

However, shipping times are delayed (likely due to the rarity of this deal) so you&#39;ll have to wait until the beginning of September to receive them.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods (wireless charging case) at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3s1sbRP">Buy AirPods (wireless charging case) at Amazon - $130</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods at Amazon - $114" href="https://amzn.to/2VHG0bR">Buy AirPods at Amazon - $114</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $190" href="https://amzn.to/3CzNDCu">Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $190</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you don&#39;t want to wait, you can skip the wireless charging case and get <a href="https://amzn.to/2VHG0bR">the regular model</a> for $114 — not a record low, but $45 less than their normal price. It&#39;s also worth noting that the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CzNDCu">AirPods Pro</a> remain $60 off, bringing them down to $190.</p><p>Even if you haven&#39;t used AirPods before, you&#39;re probably quite familiar with them, especially if you use a lot of Apple products. They&#39;re the company&#39;s true wireless earbuds that, thanks to the H1 chipset inside, pair and switch seamlessly between iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. It makes the initial setup quick and easy, and it allows you to go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac with little delay. The H1 chip also improved upon the AirPods&#39; connection range, and it enables hands-free Siri access, too.</p><p>Convenience alone is reason enough for some to invest in AirPods, but they&#39;re also a solid pair of wireless earbuds as well. Sound quality is decent (we prefer the AirPods Pro if you want the best sound quality Apple earbuds can offer) and they&#39;ll last for about five hours on a single charge. And with the wireless charging case, you can set the AirPods on any Qi-compatible pad you have in your home when you need extra juice.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-wireless-charging-case-sale-amazon-124337805.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6d05b1c-bdb9-4530-96e3-18b21c6e3a88</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:43:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628513021</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T12:43:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tesla delays another vehicle to 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s electric pickup isn’t going anywhere this year.

That&#39;s according to its configuration page, telling you that you&#39;ll get to customize your truck when &quot;production nears in 2022.&quot; This applies regardless of model — single-motor trucks were always going to arrive later, but a new 2022 launch seems to for the dual- and tri-motor machines, too.</p><p>Tesla delivering on its promises has been a rare feat recently.

Employees at the battery plant previously only needed to wear masks if they hadn&#39;t been fully vaccinated.</p><p>The tipsters said Tesla was toughening its policy in the wake of the more easily transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, including updated CDC guidance recommending that vaccinated people wear masks indoors. Although full vaccinations still reduce the chances of infection and symptoms, there&#39;s evidence that breakthrough cases (those instances when vaccinated people get infected) can readily transmit the virus to others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company hasn&#39;t responded to requests for comments, although it&#39;s not expected to do so when it quietly disbanded its public relations team in fall 2020.</p><p>Tesla has been slightly slower than its Detroit-based competitors, which reinstated mask mandates a week earlier. However, it&#39;s a sharp contrast from the EV maker&#39;s attitude in May 2020, when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-restarts-production-211807400.html">defied an Alameda County lockdown</a> and kept its Fremont car plant open. Elon Musk also threatened to move Tesla&#39;s headquarters out of California and sue the county. The move may have led to additional infections at the Fremont plant, and Musk said he contracted COVID-19 in November 2020.</p><p>It&#39;s easier for Tesla to comply this time when its factory can remain open. The car brand also can&#39;t afford to test officials&#39; patience when it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">struggling to keep up with demand</a> for its vehicles. Still, the reported mask order is a sharp contrast to Tesla&#39;s previous attitude — it&#39;s volunteering to take action rather than fighting back.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-mask-requirement-nevada-battery-factory-210035322.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">935d8a1a-0de2-4ba7-9a74-55e8210ccc9c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 21:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628513405</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T12:50:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/29d85b10-f910-11eb-b4f7-2365edb027d1" width="3407" height="1936" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/29d85b10-f910-11eb-b4f7-2365edb027d1" width="3407" height="1936" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[REUTERS/Bob Strong]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Tesla Gigafactory seen from the top of a surrounding hill.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[USA-TESLA/ Tesla Gigafactory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rocket Lab will launch its first Moon mission from New Zealand in late 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rocket Lab is narrowing down the details for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-16-rocket-lab-to-launch-nasa-cubesat.html">first Moon launch</a>.

Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">said in January</a> that there would only be a &quot;few deliveries&quot; of Cybertrucks in 2021, and that volume production was set for 2022. While the company stuck to that claim in its July quarterly report, the company only recently finished the engineering design for the EV — it would have just a few months to finish development and ship those initial trucks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That could pose a competitive challenge for Tesla. GMC&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html">Hummer EV</a> is now poised to beat the Cybertruck to market barring delays. Even with setbacks, Rivian is still due to release its R1T truck <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">in September</a>. And while Ford&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html">F-150 Lightning</a> isn&#39;t due until spring 2022, the Cybertruck may have lost its first-mover advantage.</p><p>The delay wouldn&#39;t be surprising, though. The Cybertruck&#39;s cold-rolled steel body requires unique manufacturing techniques, and that&#39;s not including broader technical hurdles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">tri-motor system</a>. Tesla is also known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-delayed-to-2021-222022916.html">optimistic timetables</a> that clash with the realities of production. The automaker can at least count on pent-up demand, though. With over 1 million Cybertruck reservations, Tesla could have plenty of demand even if many of those would-be buyers have second thoughts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d433f23e-7b91-467f-82c5-45521c4186c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 15:03:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628434991</ingested><modified>2021-08-08T15:03:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95c5d9f0-efb6-11eb-af7f-01a63ecf3054" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95c5d9f0-efb6-11eb-af7f-01a63ecf3054" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeenah Moon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla's Cybertruck is displayed at Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2021.
