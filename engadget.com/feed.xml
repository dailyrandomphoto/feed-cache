It may not be the most high-powered Chromebook out there, but it has essential features that most users need at a price well under $500. At launch, the Flex 5 came in at $430, but it often went on sale and could be found for $330 on rare occasions. But Amazon has it for even less right now — only $310 — which is $120 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310" href="https://amzn.to/3xvrtNX">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you get to the $300 mark in the Chromebook space, you&#39;re often asked to sacrifice when it comes to power. That&#39;s not the case with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review-170023587.html">Flex 5</a> — it runs on a 10th-gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Those specs should be more than enough for most people, especially considering a majority of Chromebook work will be done in a browser. We found the Flex 5 was more than capable of running numerous Chrome tabs at once with few hiccups. We also appreciated its ability to do so for at least eight hours before needing to be recharged.</p><p>When it comes to design, the Flex 5 doesn&#39;t take too many risks and that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not the slimmest or the lightest laptop, but at 0.66-inches thick and three pounds, it won&#39;t be hard to shuffle from room to room in your home or tote with you to school. It&#39;s also a convertible, which gives you more flexibility in how you use it. The 13-inch 1080p touchscreen will serve most people well, be it for work or entertainment purposes, and we especially liked its backlight keyboard.</p><p>Overall, it&#39;s hard to find a Chromebook that ticks so many boxes at this price point. Sure, Lenovo made some sacrifices when it comes to RAM and storage capacity, but those are to be expected when you&#39;re looking at sub-$500 Chromebooks. The Flex 5 combines a solid 2-in-1 design with a good amount of power at a wallet-friendly price point, and that&#39;s more than we can say for other Chromebooks coming in at $300.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-deal-310-amazon-135551711.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75c7733-dda9-47cd-a4f9-cd651db8fc28</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628602872</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T13:41:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xiaomi's Mi Mix 4 packs an under-screen camera in a ceramic body]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just days after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html">Oppo</a> unveiled its latest under-screen camera solution, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Xiaomi</a> is now launching a new flagship phone with a similar, if not the same, feature. The Mi Mix 4 is the Chinese company&#39;s slimmest ceramic unibody smartphone yet, featuring a 6.67-inch 2,400 x 1,080 screen that stealthily hides a 20-megapixel selfie camera underneath a near-indistinguishable patch of pixels — it&#39;s the same 400ppi density as the rest of the panel, albeit with smaller pixels and transparent circuitry thanks to advancements in AMOLED production.</p><p>If the selfie photos on the Mi Mix 4 turn out to be just as good, if not better, than Oppo&#39;s samples from last week, then it&#39;s no surprise that Xiaomi went with this under-screen camera tech. The Mix series has always been about pushing the boundary of form factor design, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix.html">first</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-xiaomi-mi-mix-2-ceramic-unibody-price.html">two</a> models — both designed by Philippe Starck — offering super slim screen bezels along three sides. They were some of the first ceramic smartphones, too.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix-3-slider-hands-on.html">Mi Mix 3</a>, Xiaomi finally got rid of the chin by moving the selfie camera to a slide-up module. I wasn&#39;t a fan of that design, though, as it felt more fragile.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a31d1130-f9da-11eb-befd-dbdcfab3877c" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4" data-uuid="fc37a598-9bdd-3f22-9b98-954c312b6d7b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Now that the under-screen camera is seemingly reaching maturity, it serves as a sensible evolution path to the Mi Mix 4. Still, CEO Lei Jun added that if you really care about your selfies, you should stick to phones with punch-hole cameras; but for him, the under-screen camera is good enough.</p><p>The screen itself is otherwise very much the same as what many other recent flagships are offering: 10-bit color, P3 gamut, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, 120Hz refresh rate and 480Hz touch sampling rate. It&#39;s protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus. Like many recent Xiaomi phones, the Mi Mix 4 provides stereo sound tuned by Harman/Kardon, which should go well with that vibrant screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e8ef87c0-f9de-11eb-8dff-b48a3049e120" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 heat sink" data-uuid="1a7aad1c-17c6-3e77-9e59-9efb2d7a579c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Mi Mix 4 also happens to be the first smartphone sporting Qualcomm&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G processor, taking the clock speed up to 3GHz while being cooled by several layers of graphene and graphite. LPDDR5 RAM options range from 8GB to 12GB, whereas UFS 3.1 storage goes from 128GB to 512GB.</p><p>Much like the iPhone 12 series, the Mi Mix 4 also packs UWB (ultra-wide band), but instead of tracking tags, Xiaomi is using this for a feature dubbed &quot;Point to Connect.&quot; Simply point your Mi Mix 4 to a compatible Xiaomi smart device like a TV, smart speaker (like the freshly-announced Xiaomi Sound) or air conditioner, and the relevant app will show up.&nbsp;</p><p>The company will also offer a small UWB hub for existing TVs, and this will launch via a beta program in China on August 20th. But if you prefer the old-school way, this Android phone also has an infrared remote feature — as is the case with some Chinese smartphones these days.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e4620a00-f9d6-11eb-afff-27e8fb11a2c0" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4" data-uuid="afcbbd7f-6280-3ef6-a690-a108b66e9772"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The rear cameras are impressive on paper.

Still, Lei admitted on stage that he&#39;s saving the better camera components for his main flagship line.</p><p>The Mi Mix 4 houses a 4,500mAh which is relatively standard these days, but it supports 120W wired charging, which goes from zero to 100 percent in 21 minutes by default, or in just 15 minutes if you enable &quot;Boost Mode.&quot; There&#39;s also 50W wireless charging, which normally takes 45 minutes for a full charge, or just 28 minutes in &quot;Boost Mode.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/86b3fa50-f9de-11eb-af7f-dd94af85129c" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4" data-uuid="3f4d0196-a30f-3c9e-93cc-9caced163ef7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Xiaomi will be selling the Mi Mix 4 in China starting from August 16th, with colors including white, black and a new gray option.

Google, for instance, turned off automatic selfie retouching on Pixel phones and stopped referring to the processes as beauty filters. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Twitter&#39;s algorithm took a more neutral stance on content in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ai-bias-beauty-filters-133210055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b094bc08-b952-4538-9e79-696343fb4463</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:32:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628602332</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T13:32:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea9ee970-eb0c-11eb-bff7-edec61e3c4f2" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea9ee970-eb0c-11eb-bff7-edec61e3c4f2" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/06/08: In this photo illustration a Twitter logo is seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.

Now, thirty years and change since its heyday, Retro Games is making a “mini” version of the computer and games console. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-commodore-64-mini-releases-in-2018.html">Retro Games’</a> last machine, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-06-c64-mini-review.html">“mini” version of the Commodore 64</a> that can’t use the Commodore name, this will be branded as THEA500 Mini.</p><p>Retro Games has said that the console will include 25 titles from the vast (and excellent) Amiga library including <em>Another World, Worms, Simon the Sorcerer</em> and <em>The Chaos Engine</em>. The full list of titles hasn’t been released, but if<em> Bart vs. The Space Mutants</em> and <em>Dalek Attack </em>aren’t on there, I will<em> cry</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8255fdc9c2c4481aa0dc4f8721a22fb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKUgEOpr4Qs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Much like pretty much every other retro console, a glossy software layer will smooth out the rougher edges of this software. Users will be able to save and resume titles part-way through play, and you’ll be able to side-load titles you (ahem) own over the included USB port.</p><p>Rather than simply emulating the vanilla Amiga 500, the hardware will also run the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) layers found in the Amiga 500 Plus, a short-lived revision released in 1991. You’ll also be able to harness the advanced graphics architecture (AGA) of the much-pricier flagship model, the Amiga 1200.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a90f4f0-f9da-11eb-a5ff-8a575ca64846" style="height:1500;width:2000;" alt="Looks more like a CD controller to me." data-uuid="8678ab84-5e83-391d-bc35-b091c51d21c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Retro Games / Koch Media</div></figure><p>Hardware-wise, it’s likely to be a similar sort of moulded-plastic-around-a-mini-board situation as found in THEC64 Mini. But on the accessories front, it’ll ship with the Amiga’s famous two-button mouse, and a joypad that, to my eyes, seems to be based on the Amiga CD32’s gamepad rather than the 500’s (which, to be fair, was more famously a joystick-led machine).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b98770a0-f9da-11eb-afeb-0f39e83c0602" style="height:1600;width:2000;" alt="Image of Retro Games&#39; THEA500 Mouse" data-uuid="267551d5-b8f5-3fb8-9572-04db9063f33a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Retro Games / Koch Media</div></figure><p>THEA500 Mini will launch at some point in early 2022, and is expected to cost $140 (£120, €130) when it arrives. The only misgivings I have at this point is that Retro Games’ previous work with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-c64-mini-launches-in-us-october-9.html">THEC64 Mini</a> made that a hard product to love in several ways. Hopefully, however, many of those issues have been resolved for the new model, which was the object of lust for many people soon be knocking on 40.</p><p>Oh, and here&#39;s the greatest advert for a computer ever made:</p><div id="c807203667034f4a83e27d7cb0acd110"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlzUu5LYw1k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/retro-games-thea500-mini-commodore-amiga-500-console-131501091.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">814d848a-ad79-4a92-b281-f2920d23b835</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:15:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628600625</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T13:04:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/79c8c680-f9da-11eb-be39-17ea40aaa5dd" width="2000" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/79c8c680-f9da-11eb-be39-17ea40aaa5dd" width="2000" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Retro Games / Koch Media]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Retro Games' A500 Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amiga 500 Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's new safety measures are designed to protect kids on YouTube, Search and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has announced changes to YouTube, Search and its other apps designed to make them safer for kids. The latest updates will make YouTube videos created by kids private by default, allow minors or their parents to request the removal of their images from Google Image results, turn SafeSearch on by default and more. The move is part of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-parental-controls-tweens-teens-supervised-accounts-160050870.html">recent push</a> by Google to protect kids and give parents more control over what they see.</p><p>Many of the updates are dedicated to YouTube and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-youtube-kids-website.html">YouTube Kids</a>. The key change is aimed at young creators aged 13 to 17, changing the default upload setting to the most private option available. That means by default, the video can only be seen by select users unless the creator changes it to public. &quot;We want to help younger users... make an intentional choice if they’d like to make their content public,&quot; Google wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is also expanding its so-called digital well-being tools for YouTube. It&#39;ll turn on break and bedtime reminders by default for all kids aged 13 to 17 while turning off autoplay by default. At the same time, it&#39;s adding an autoplay option on YouTube Kids while, at the same time, turning it off by default in the app. Parents will also be able to choose a &quot;locked&quot; default autoplay setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Knowing the accurate age of our users across multiple products and surfaces, while at the same time respecting their privacy and ensuring that our services remain accessible, is a complex challenge.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Google said it will be removing &quot;overly commercial content&quot; from YouTube Kids, like a video that &quot;only focuses on product packaging or directly encourages children to spend money.&quot; It also updated the disclosures that appear on “made for kids” content when a creator identifies a video as containing paid promotions.</p><p>On Search, Google promised to give minors &quot;more control over their digital footprint.&quot; To that end, it&#39;s introducing a new policy allowing anyone under 18, or their parents or guardians, to request the removal of their images from Google Image search results. That change is designed to &quot;help give young people more control of their image online,&quot; Google wrote. It will also turn SafeSearch on for all existing users under 18 and make it the default for teens setting up new accounts. Currently, it&#39;s just turned on for teen accounts managed by Family Link.</p><p>In other apps, Google will disable location history for all users under 18 without the ability to turn it on. It&#39;s launching a safety section in Play that will show parents which apps follow Google&#39;s Families policies and disclose how they use the data they collect in greater detail. On the advertising side, it will &quot;block ad targeting based on the age, gender, or interests of people under 18,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Google stressed that it wants to work with &quot;kids and teens, parents, governments, industry leaders, and experts in the fields of privacy, child safety, wellbeing and education to design better, safer products for kids and teens.&quot; Taken as a whole, the new changes should help prevent young people from seeing harmful content while blocking exploitive ads. In practice, however, it may take some time to shake out any bugs and ensure that advertisers are following the rules — so as always, it&#39;s best to keep a close eye on your kids&#39; digital habits.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-major-safety-changes-for-kids-on-search-you-tube-and-more-130051206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5bf4dd96-ebf4-4e64-ab95-922fc031e23a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628582422</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T08:00:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/d7482380-cf3b-11e9-bf59-af0045c94c3d" width="4166" height="2628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d7482380-cf3b-11e9-bf59-af0045c94c3d" width="4166" height="2628" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - APRIL 10:  In this photo illustration, the logo of the Google and You Tube Kids applications are displayed on the screen of an Apple iPhone on April 10, 2018 in Paris, France.

It&#39;s still a little black box capable of streaming 1080p video from a variety of sources including Apple TV+, Netflix, Disney+ and others. It runs on Apple&#39;s A8 processor, comes with 32GB of onboard storage and the back edge houses a power port, one USB-C port, one HDMI connector and an Ethernet port. These specs make it a good basic set-top box, but it has some Apple-ecosystem features that set it apart. It supports AirPlay and HomeKit-enabled viewing of camera feeds, plus you&#39;ll be able to listen privately using AirPods.</p><p>The update earlier this year brought the latest Siri remote to the Apple TV HD. This is a big deal because the previous Siri remote just wasn&#39;t that great to use, and Apple finally fixed some of its major problems. The new remote is larger and has a revamped directional pad that makes controlling the set-top box much easier.

My favorite was <em>Gargoyles</em>. I have a special place in my heart for <em>TaleSpin</em>, but <em>DuckTales</em> was the undisputed king of the lineup. One hundred episodes and a movie with plenty of race cars, lasers, airplanes, robots, super suits, caveducks and, of course, Scrooge’s Lucky Number One Dime.</p><p>Plenty of cartoons from the ‘80s have seen reboots in the past decade, but few have failed to outshine the original or gain a real fandom. So when a <em>DuckTales</em> reboot was announced, I was admittedly a bit wary, though the cast announcement certainly was enough to get my jaded self at least a little excited, with David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck and Beck Bennett as Launchpad McQuack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d075d6f106c449379cad76113ab9bf4d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZek9PFMYOw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show debuted in July 2017 and I have to say they nailed it. It straddled the line between giving fans all the little in-jokes and callbacks to the original show they loved, but also introducing new characters (like tech mogul Mark Beaks) and plotlines to make the show feel fresh and modern. Huey, Dewey and Louie were given different color-coded outfit designs, distinct personalities and separate character arcs. Mrs. Beakley was upgraded from Scrooge’s housekeeper to also being a former secret agent he used to work with. And Webby was aged up and made more adventurous, so she could hold her own on any journey and even make a few friends along the way.</p><p>The show’s biggest strength was how heavily it drew from its source material, not just the original series but the original Carl Barks comics that inspired it in the first place. <em>DuckTales</em> (2017) marks the first animated appearance of Huey, Dewey and Louie’s mother (and Donald’s sister) Della. She was also modernized, made into an adventuring pilot with a short temper, not unlike her brother’s. The show also referenced other Disney Afternoon shows like <em>TaleSpin</em>, <em>Chip ’N’ Dale’s Rescue Rangers</em> and <em>Goof Troop</em>. It was truly a love letter to fans, but one with a solid plot and some wicked humor that today’s kids could still enjoy.</p><div id="1589be216df64eb3b3b8ddc37fda0fca"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XWCCzD7TTI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show came to an end earlier this year, with the third season hitting <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> back in March. While the first season dealt with Magica DeSpell and season two was all about the Moon, season three pit Clan McDuck against the evil agency F.O.W.L. The creators knew this would be the last season, so it also pulls double duty on tying up stray plotlines and checking off their bucket list. That included bringing back Darkwing Duck and setting up a possible spinoff show, telling us the story of how Scrooge met Donald and Della, and even giving us a pseudo-sequel to <em>TaleSpin</em>.</p><p>Family was also a constant theme in the last season, with the show delving into Della’s newfound parenthood as well as where Webby ultimately sits within the family. I didn’t quite cry during the finale, but I came close. One thing that kept me going in the end was the knowledge that the story would continue in some form, not just in comics but in a weekly podcast featuring all the original voice actors. Seven episodes of <a href="https://youtu.be/2cDUgXVUpks"><em>This Duckburg Life</em></a> are available (yes, it is a parody of Ira Glass), and a nice thing about the program is that it contains no spoilers for the cartoon so you can check it out even before you binge the show on Disney+. The episodes are fairly short, less than 15 minutes, which is fine because DuckTales has always been good at packing a lot of adventure into its 22-minute runtime.</p><div id="35a997b9f4d04be78621a0b8a4d2c527"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOxxw8zu-sM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ducktales-2017-reboot-podcast-disney-plus-110100145.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4812f19-9fde-4f7d-b045-a71c65429268</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 11:01:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628542213</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:50:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DUCKTALES – “The Last Adventure!” – The future of adventuring hangs in the balance as the Duck family uncovers earth-shattering secrets in a final standoff with the Fiendish Organization for World Larceny (F.O.W.L.).

The VPN itself is baked into the Google One app, and the company says it will encrypt and protect you no matter what app you’re using. Plus, if you’re unsure how exactly to get connected, you can schedule a Pro Session for an expert to coach you through the basics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, Google is reminding folks that the VPN has seen a number of feature upgrades since its launch, including the ability to block internet traffic when the VPN is inactive. You can also bypass the VPN in specific situations or with specific mobile apps, and set timed controls for when you need to be free from its protective embrace. Google added that the VPN has been independently audited and found to be robust enough for most folks to trust it.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-one-vpn-canada-mexico-europe-101525353.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6581eb5e-d017-44a5-83a3-473df32c4d54</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 10:15:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628590132</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T10:09:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/80c1faa0-f9c2-11eb-bfd6-604f36316b0a" width="1000" height="409" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/80c1faa0-f9c2-11eb-bfd6-604f36316b0a" width="1000" height="409" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google’s One Plan VPN is now available outside the US]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google simplifies its Titan security key lineup]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/08/simplifying-titan-security-key-options.html">announced</a> that it is retiring the Bluetooth version of its Titan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ios-security-keys-advanced-protection-program-170914589.html">security key</a> in order to streamline its security product line. The search giant will now only offer two editions; one with USB-A and USB-C, both of which will pack NFC to enable it to be used by most mobile devices.

Starting September 1st, you&#39;ll be able to contact Amazon directly with a property damage or personal injury claim, and then Amazon will connect you with the seller.

The entry-level package includes access to four classes every 30 days. If you already pay for an in-studio membership, you can buy a $20 add-on that gives you access to the app&#39;s on-demand content.

I could not do both.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>DC had presented me with a three-year renewal of my exclusive contract, with the intent of me working on Batman for the bulk of that time. I was grateful of the offer, but I couldn’t help but look at the success of my original, creator owned titles and wonder if it was the right choice.</p></blockquote><p>Substack first got into comics back in June when it signed Marvel&#39;s <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> writer Nick Spencer. Spencer reportedly spearheaded the idea and was the liaison between Substack and newly signed creators. On top of comic book stories, they&#39;ll publish, essays, how-to guides and other content on the platform.</p><p>Until recently, Substack has mostly focused on newsletters covering politics, technology and more. Comics, meanwhile, have been around forever on the web, but have largely been funded by ads and merchandise sales. By joining with Substack, creators will be able to engage directly with readers in a model that more closely resembles comic book sales.&nbsp;</p><p>In his Substack <a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era">launch post</a>, Tynion said that he effectively turned down a three-year renewal of his DC Batman contract when Substack signed him &quot;to create a new slate of original comic book properties directly on their platform, that my co-creators and I would own completely,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I’m going to dedicate my whole brain to building a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms, without having to get permission from any publisher to make it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/substack-signs-a-slate-of-big-name-comics-creators-042310705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c2076b1-2951-485b-bed3-36bb179b84a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:23:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569389</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:23:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Visual Arts]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Avon Oeming]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Parallels 17 promises better M1 Mac performance and Windows 11 support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Parallels, the company best known for its virtualization software that lets you run Windows and Linux directly on your Mac, has had a busy year. In addition to building a version of Parallels that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-chromebook-running-windows-10-170015389.html">run on Chrome OS</a> for the first time, the company also had to figure out how to quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-m1-mac-native-virtual-machine-144526933.html">make its software work with the new, ARM-based M1 Macs</a> that arrived last fall. Now, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Parallels Desktop 17" href="https://fave.co/3As1rgi">Parallels Desktop 17</a> is being released with improved performance on M1 Macs, as well as full support for the upcoming macOS Monterey and Windows 11 operating systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Before getting into these improvements, though, it&#39;s worth taking a moment to talk compatibility. Apple moving the Mac to ARM architecture means there are now two classes of Macs for Parallels to support. As of today, the only versions of Windows that Parallels can run on an M1 Mac are the Insider Previews for Windows 10 and Windows 11 — because those versions of the OS are able to run on ARM-based hardware. But, Parallels unequivocally says that when the full version of Windows 11 is released to the public, it&#39;ll run on Parallels 17.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On an Intel-based Mac, however, users can still run a host of virtual machines, including Windows support all the way back to XP and Windows 2000, and macOS all the way back to 2011&#39;s OS X Lion. It officially supports 12 different Linux distros, while M1 Macs can only virtualize four right now (including Ubuntu and Fedora).</p><p>So while Intel Macs still offer the broadest compatibility, Parallels has found that the raw power of the M1 chip means users likely aren&#39;t giving anything up running the Windows 10 or 11 Insider Previews. Microsoft&#39;s built-in emulation for Windows means that Windows 10 Insider Preview can run almost any 32-bit x86 app as well as &quot;many&quot; 64-bit x86 apps, and the M1&#39;s power helps to make up for speed lost due to emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what&#39;s new, Parallels has speed improvements across the board, whether you&#39;re running Intel or M1. Regardless of which system you&#39;re using, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38 percent faster, while OpenGL graphics run up to six times faster than the previous version. M1-specific speed improvements include 20 percent faster disk performance when using Windows 10 Insider preview, while DirectX graphics should perform up to 28 percent better. These tests are all run by Parallels, and we can&#39;t verify them yet, but improving performance has long been a focus for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a handful of new features on board, as well. Parallels improved its &quot;Coherence&quot; mode, where you can run a Windows app without launching into the full Windows UI. Now, things like shutdowns, updates and sign-in screens are windowed as well, making them easier to pop into the background. The ability to drag and drop between Windows and Mac apps has been improved, as well — for example, you can now highlight and drop text and images between Mac and Windows apps, and it&#39;ll work with the new Quick Note feature coming to macOS Monterey.&nbsp;</p><p>Parallels 17 also contains a virtual TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, which lets the system use BitLocker and Secure Boot when running Windows 10 and Windows 11. There&#39;s an added layer of intrigue to this feature: Microsoft originally said that a computer with a TPM chip was a requirement for Windows 11 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">before backtracking</a> (at least for the testing period). It&#39;s not clear yet if the final version of Windows 11 will require a TPM chip, but this virtualization should let Parallels users get around this requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>As with most software these days, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Parallels Desktop 17" href="https://fave.co/3As1rgi">Parallels Desktop 17</a> is being sold as a subscription. The standard edition is $79.99 per year, and the pro edition costs $99.99 per year. If you&#39;re on a subscription, you&#39;ll get Parallels updates as long as the subscription is active. If you prefer, though, you can get a perpetual license of the standard edition Parallels 17 for $99.99; people who have purchased a past perpetual license can upgrade for $49.99.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-17-m-1-mac-performance-windows-11-support-040128211.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e066b1b9-9226-4a38-910b-a12c18d77ac1</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:01:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628604234</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T14:04:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Parallels]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony closes $1.175 billion deal to buy Crunchyroll from AT&T]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s official.

In newly unsealed court documents, the two companies say the fraudsters made knockoffs of some of GoPro&#39;s most popular accessories that blatantly used its branding to try and trick potential buyers.</p><p>Among the products the counterfeiters saw to pass off as authentic include GoPro&#39;s signature &quot;3-Way&quot; and &quot;The Handler&quot; grips. The knockoffs were often hard to spot, with subtle differences between them and their real GoPro counterparts. For instance, some had foam handles that were a slightly different color from the one you&#39;ll find on tripods from the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;When counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they not only violate the intellectual property rights of companies like GoPro, they also mislead consumers and harm Amazon&#39;s reputation as a place to buy authentic goods,&quot; said Kebharu Smith, director of Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-095555911.html">recently formed Counterfeit Crimes Unit</a>.</p><p>Amazon and GoPro aren&#39;t the first companies to take legal action against fraudsters using the platform to sell counterfeit goods.
