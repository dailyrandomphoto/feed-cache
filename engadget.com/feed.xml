The 1.90:1 IMAX aspect ratio will look up to 26 percent taller than the typical 2.35:1 widescreen format in Marvel films, so those annoying black bars will almost disappear while you&#39;re watching scenes shot in IMAX. (You&#39;ll still see some slight bars, though, as the IMAX format doesn&#39;t completely fill 16x9 widescreen TVs.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-9f6c-2e83d138eada" alt="Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi" data-uuid="b1ab7d32-b914-3998-890d-2dca4e2c87cf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p>Before this Disney+ partnership, IMAX and DTS brought the &quot;<a href="https://www.imaxenhanced.com/">IMAX Enhanced</a>&quot; home viewing format to a handful of TV streaming apps, like Sony&#39;s Bravia Core. IMAX-ified films will have a prominent label on their Disney+ screens, and you&#39;ll also be able to launch the standard widescreen version if you prefer. Physical Blu-ray collectors are already used to shifting IMAX aspect ratios in some films, most notably <em>The Dark Knight, Tenet</em> and <em>Mission Impossible: Fallout</em>, but streaming films have typically lost on this perk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expanded aspect ratio should give Marvel&#39;s action sequences more room to pop on your TV, and it&#39;s a feature Disney+ can lord over its streaming competitors. Technically, IMAX Enhanced isn&#39;t delivering the large film format&#39;s true aspect ratio, which is more square. But, as we saw with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-hbo-max-fandom-133004404.html"><em>Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League</em></a>, that leads to enormous black bars on the sides of your TV. It&#39;s also worth noting that we won&#39;t see IMAX versions of <em>The Avengers</em> and <em>Ant-Man</em>, as those are the rare Marvel films that used the <a href="https://neiloseman.com/aspect-ratio-and-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/">TV-filling 1.85:1 aspect ratio</a> (a choice made to convey a better sense of height).</p><p>Looking ahead, IMAX Enhanced will also bring immersive DTS sound to Disney+, a competing option to the more ubiquitous Dolby Atmos format. Representatives from all of the companies involved tell us that IMAX Enhanced films will also support Dolby Vision, HDR10, 4K (naturally) and Dolby Atmos sound.</p><div id="0b210c1353014c708d6ef52e0cc27d54"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uxOvXM7eBc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Here are all the IMAX Enhanced films <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impact radius;pdid:arriving on Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">arriving on Disney+</a> on November 12th:</p><ul><li><p><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Panther</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Widow</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain Marvel</em></p></li><li><p><em>Doctor Strange</em></p></li><li><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy 1 &amp; 2</em></p></li><li><p><em>Iron Man</em></p></li><li><p><em>Thor Ragnarok</em></p></li><li><p><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em></p></li></ul>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7cee7ad-53b0-47dd-9848-586b0c78f603</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636374251</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T12:24:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Marvel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops to a new record low of $800]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even with the high-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">MacBook Pros</a> now available, we still consider the MacBook Air M1 to be the best Apple laptop for most people. We&#39;ve seen the notebook go up and down in price this year, but now you can grab it at the best price we&#39;ve seen. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3052rKx">256GB model</a> is down to $800, or $200 off its normal price, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3bSuuzu">512GB model</a> has the same $200 discount, bringing its final price down to $1,050. As of writing this post, the silver option in both storage capacities is sold out, so we recommend grabbing the color you want soon.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3052rKx" id="2bbd6e13d8b94457b7d3a4751e5ec1d8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $800</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bSuuzu" id="cc77fd8f529b4062bcd114f775dfd39b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,050</a><p>Apple&#39;s thinnest and lightest laptop earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">score of 94</a> from us when it first came out due mostly to its impressive performance and lack of fan noise. The M1 chipset makes this MacBook Air feel speedier and smoother than previous models, helping the notebook wake almost instantly when you open the lid and making the machine more responsive overall. You&#39;ll also notice GPU improvements as well — while the MacBook Air isn&#39;t a gaming machine, you&#39;ll be able to play Apple Arcade titles easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple removed the fan from the inside of the MacBook Air M1, so you won&#39;t be bothered by whirring noises even when pushing the machine to its limits. It&#39;s a small detail, but it makes the experience of using the laptop much better — and you&#39;ll be able to do so for a long time thanks to the MacBook Air&#39;s 16-hour battery life. Arguably the biggest downsides to the Air M1 come from its svelteness: it only has two USB-C ports, which is in stark contrast to the new MacBook Pros&#39; wide array of useful connectors. But if you can deal with the dongle life for a bit, the MacBook Air M1 will likely serve you well as your daily driver.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-drops-to-new-record-low-of-800-131618656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a428c1c-5e5e-4841-b823-9eb1542a7766</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:16:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636377381</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T13:16:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13a6e560-0747-11ec-adef-468b93b5e070" width="2000" height="1357" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13a6e560-0747-11ec-adef-468b93b5e070" width="2000" height="1357" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple&#39;s MacBook Air M1 drops to a new record low of $800]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WH-XB910 ANC headphones are $110 off in one-day Amazon sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has the best in-ear and over-the-ear wireless ANC headphones on the market right now, but it also has some of the best mid-range models.

Now, it has released the three-axis Crane M3 designed for mirrorless cameras, with some interesting new features like a tiny LED light and a built-in screen.</p><p>The Crane M3 is about the size of a water bottle and offers tilt, roll and pan axes with locks for each. It works with smartphones and 90 percent of mirrorless cameras, Zhiyun notes. It has a smart new white and black chassis that the company says delivers a better gripping and user experience. It also offers upgraded motors with stronger torque than the original Crane 3.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A key feature is the quick-release design with different plates that lets you change rapidly between different sized cameras (action and mirrorless, for instance), without the need to rebalance. It also has a quarter-inch adapter so you can connect a professional microphone to an expansion base and run a second cable to the camera. A mic or other accessory can then be attached to a quarter-inch threaded expansion port. Zhiyun is even selling its own shotgun mic in one of the packages, or you can connect other models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/911b26b0-4080-11ec-8ffa-7ddd55b8d1cd" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="0726ed00-9cdc-3e43-9cc2-e0701e53a686"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>The most noticeable feature, though, is an 800-lumen 6 watt dual-color LED light. It&#39;s designed for &quot;impromptu low-light shooting,&quot; Zhiyun notes, with full stepless dimming control and temperature settings via a control wheel. The light is softened with a translucent filter, though it&#39;s largely designed for run-and-gun shooting.</p><p>Other features include Bluetooth (or USB-C) control of supported cameras and a joystick and wheel to control, roll axis, aperture, shutter and ISO. If you&#39;d rather not set controls using the smartphone app, it also offers a 1.22-inch full-color interactive touchscreen to change mode settings (portrait, vortex and go modes), as well as follow speed. It also shows camera operational status, gimbal connection and battery levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Zhiyun sent me a unit to try out, complete with the expansion plate, so I attached a Panasonic GH5 II. While some functions weren&#39;t working (like the camera app), it was one of the easier gimbals to balance that I&#39;ve tried and it&#39;s certainly easy to detach and attach the camera using the quick release plates. The ability to connect a microphone away from the camera is also smart, reducing complexity and rebalancing, though you&#39;d need some accessories to attach a decent-sized microphone.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7d91ee30-4080-11ec-affc-d20b758f54b4" style="height:1088;width:1920;" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="32511dbb-0ae7-3f86-845d-aa88a521b71a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>Operation was smooth, with controls well placed for manual operations. The touchscreen was nice, though it&#39;s relatively easy to hit it by mistake — I did so once and accidentally changed the language. The lighting feature works great in a pinch, but because of the small size, it casts some harsh shadows. Hopefully all the features I didn&#39;t get to try, including app support, will be available soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Zhiyun Crane M3 is <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__store.zhiyun-2Dtech.com_products_crane-2Dm3-3Futm-5Fsource-3Dmk-26utm-5Fmedium-3Dpr&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=xBh4qrZHzH-A4SJ2NivNNdBzNWZBAjTsDJEJZG5k5-s&amp;m=b9Cpt14Rn7N4EfLrINHuOqfTXUTMTVS_wIyE2aJSs9o&amp;s=C6Q2UTeWQWRReHwkQHB1BxVNZ-Y2Mt4IA76odOBbTwA&amp;e=">now available</a> to order starting at $369 (£369) for the standard package, $449 (£449) for the combo package with a backpack, cellphone mount and Tripod Plus, or $649 (£649) for the Pro package, including all the above plus the TransMount Shotgun Microphone and TransMount Expansion Base.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zhiyuns-latest-gimbal-has-an-led-light-and-small-display-110014863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7024bd88-a901-429a-a679-11c457f23669</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 11:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636370658</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T11:24:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af249100-4085-11ec-93fa-9fb30ab63648" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af249100-4085-11ec-93fa-9fb30ab63648" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zhiyun's three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zhiyun's three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney+ special offer cuts subscriptions to $2 for the first month]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of Disney+ Day on November 12th, Disney is trying to tempt folks to its streaming service with an offer of <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">one month for just $2</a>, it <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">announced</a>.

The hard way, apparently. In his &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on/">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman (with help from developer Steve Moser) claimed to have seen code indicating Netflix would release all its games &quot;individually&quot; on iOS, through the App Store. They won&#39;t all be downloadable and playable within the app, Gurman added.</p><p>The main Netflix app would still offer access to the game catalog, but you&#39;d merely be launching a separate app when you tap a game. That&#39;s currently how it works with Android, but Netflix has the option of folding games into its Android app. On iOS, it would have no choice but to make games available separately. Apple requires that every game on the App Store receive an individual screening, even if it&#39;s only available through the cloud.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You could see this coming in light of Apple&#39;s approach, but it still indicates that Netflix will have to make some compromises if it&#39;s going to bring mobile games to iOS. This also underscores a growing rivalry between Apple and Netflix, as Gurman explained. The two are competing on an increasing number of fronts, ranging from gaming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">streaming video services</a>, but neither can afford to estrange the other.

Attacks against political leaders are still very rare, though. If accurate, the reported Iraqi plot suggests drone terrorism is entering a new phase — extremists are using robotic fliers to hit major targets too dangerous to strike using conventional methods.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iraq-prime-minister-drone-assassination-attempt-182450389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5321a3a6-8c38-42be-9899-f00c2d5dc6ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 18:24:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636316874</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T20:28:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unrest, Conflicts & War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Armed Forces]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A destroyed vehicle is parked in front of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi's residence following an assassination attempt by an armed drone in Baghdad, Iraq in this screen grab taken from a handout video obtained by Reuters on November 7, 2021.

The details of the lobbying weren&#39;t revealed in the public disclosure, but the description suggested you would hail a taxi from the Uber app like you could in the company&#39;s earlier days.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Uber for comment, although it declined to speak to <em>The Post</em>. A TLC spokesperson shied away from discussing details, saying only that the Commission &quot;meets frequently&quot; with licensees to explore ideas and that it was focused on relief efforts for drivers struggling with taxi medallion debt.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yellow cab hailing might seem an unusual choice for a company that has routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">clashed with the taxi industry</a> and is frequently blamed for gutting NYC&#39;s cab demand. Uber would likely have to rethink its commissions to compensate taxi drivers who pay steep costs to operate in the city, and it could still face political opposition given its history.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to see why Uber might consider offering NYC taxis. The revival would increase the chances of passengers scoring some kind of ride through the Uber app, even if there aren&#39;t enough ridesharing drivers to go around. That could keep New Yorkers using the Uber app and increase the chances they&#39;ll use the company&#39;s more familiar options.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-new-york-city-yellow-taxi-cab-dispatch-171021741.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24e6d4dd-15a1-4c62-a045-5b018a5ae940</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636305024</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T17:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VIEW press via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 16: Yellow cabs and Uber car drive through Times Square on November 16, 2020 in New York City.

It’s something she does throughout the first four episodes of <em>Arcane</em>, the Netflix series based on <em>League of Legends</em> lore, and it’s a tiny yet charming habit. Vi’s leg shakes up and down with anxious anger as she argues with her friend from a squashed armchair in their makeshift lair; later, her knee bounces as she sits alone in a dark room, facing certain doom. It’s something that makes Vi feel real, like she has a history that she carries with her, as natural as her pink hair.</p><p>Even though <em>Arcane </em>is packed with incredible action and delicious animation, small details like these truly bring the world to life — only for Jinx to blow it all to smithereens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa211-3dc6-11ec-b6e5-582f0cb3c203" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="4842e494-0d07-31cd-9970-98c201d2ac6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><strong><em>Warning: Slight spoilers for the first four episodes of </em></strong><strong>Arcane</strong><strong><em> ahead.</em></strong></p><p><em>Arcane</em> begins with a quintessential story of class warfare, depicting violent clashes between the rich citizens of Piltover and the oppressed, criminal society of Zaun, where Vi, Jinx and their crew live. In the first three episodes, Vi and Jinx are kids: Vi is the leader of a small gang of teen outlaws, while Jinx — who actually goes by Powder at this time — is her little sister, a few years of heist experience and growth spurts behind the others. By the fourth episode, Vi and Jinx are older and on equal footing, even when they find themselves on opposite sides.</p><p>The sisters start out surrounded by their chosen family members, including their father figure, Vander, who acts as the unofficial mayor of Zaun. A former leader of the resistance, Vander runs a bar called The Last Drop and tries to keep the peace with the Enforcers, Piltover’s militarized security team. Meanwhile, scientists in Piltover are on the verge of harnessing synthetic magic, while the most vile forces in Zaun are creating monster soldiers by feeding people shimmering purple liquid. Altogether, it’s a recipe for war.</p><div id="70a64e99187f4c27ad384cc5bc6e6c98"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Arcane</em>’s disparate worlds are vibrant, vast and alive, Piltover shining gold among the clouds and Zaun buried beneath the dirt, filled with toxic green light. The show itself feels less like anime and more like an almost-R-rated Disney film, with buttery-smooth character movements and elaborate environments, courtesy of Riot Games’ go-to animation studio, Fortiche Production. The entire thing looks as if it were the product of motion-capture technology, but it’s hand-animated in a mix of 2D and 3D.</p><p>The fights in <em>Arcane</em> are particularly gorgeous. Vi is a boxer, diving in with her fists raised, while Jinx has a bunch of semi-functional homemade grenades covered in crayon scribbles, allowing her to participate from afar — even though she wants to be with the big kids, in the center of the action. The largest battles tend to play out in slow-motion, with emotional electronic music thrumming through the scenes and close-up shots of vicious punches, heavy kicks and last-second dodges. In wider angles, every frame of these fights has desktop-wallpaper potential.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f905b5d0-3dc7-11ec-b5fd-1f9dfff67124" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="067cbc52-a512-359f-84f7-9de16ff01b3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><em>Arcane </em>takes its time establishing characters and revealing how they’re all intertwined, and by the end of episode three, this work crashes into a massive fight scene and pays off in a powerful way. In <em>League of Legends </em>lore, Vi and Jinx are bitter rivals, but in <em>Arcane</em>, they start off as sisters with a deep, true love for one another. They support each other, save each other’s lives, and fall apart together. They feel inseparable. It takes something catastrophic to rip them apart, and <em>Arcane</em> shows us every horrific second. It’s heartbreaking.</p><p>It’s not all about Vi and Jinx, and there are plenty of other <em>League of Legends</em> characters with starring roles in <em>Arcane</em>, including Viktor, Jayce, Ekko, Caitlyn and Heimerdinger. As a fan of the game, I feel a happy spark whenever I recognize a face or name in <em>Arcane</em>, but it won’t detract from the experience if you don’t already know who these people are. This is an origin story, after all.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cfa1d47f4a8d4378a17364bb3692341b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa210-3dc6-11ec-af3b-57f2067665d8" alt="Arcane"></section><p>Episode four, which will hit Netflix along with two other episodes on November 13th, fast-forwards to a time when Jinx and Vi look more like their in-game character models, and it establishes the groundwork for a future confrontation — family reunion? — between the two. Jinx and Vi are both haunted by their pasts, and their evolution is captivating. The story spins out around them, tantalizing and tense.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>might ruin me. The show quickly and effortlessly establishes connections with its characters, bolstered by an enchanting animation style and emotional, raw voice acting. It’s making me feel things, and I’m only four episodes in. The first batch of three <em>Arcane</em> episodes is on Netflix today, November 6th, while the second bunch will land on November 13th, and the final three will hit on November 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b9cd0c21-140f-479e-a644-5248f7f1fcad</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 02:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636132210</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T17:10:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft OneDrive app will stop syncing with Windows 7 and 8 on March 1st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is trying to nudge more people toward newer Windows versions. As <em>Thurott</em><a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/microsoft-consumer-services/onedrive/259004/microsoft-to-kill-onedrive-for-windows-7-8-8-1-in-early-2022">reports</a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/end-of-support-for-onedrive-desktop-application-on-windows-7-8/ba-p/2929066">warned</a> that the OneDrive desktop app will stop syncing with personal Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 computers on March 1st, 2022. The software will no longer receive updates from January 1st onward. You can still use the web to manually transfer files, but that&#39;s clearly a hassle if you routinely access cloud files from an older PC.</p><p>Business customers won&#39;t have much of a reprieve, either. Microsoft is tying corporate OneDrive support to the Windows cycle for relevant machines. Windows 7 and 8.1 workplace users will have until January 10th, 2023 (the end of extended support for both platforms), while Windows 8 users are already out of luck.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company wasn&#39;t shy about its reasoning. This will help &quot;focus resources&quot; on newer Windows platforms and technologies, according to OneDrive developers. In other words, Microsoft really wants you to upgrade to Windows 10 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a>.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a completely unexpected move. Microsoft has long had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-germany-microsoft-extended-security.html">trouble persuading some customers</a> to upgrade to newer versions of Windows, to the point where companies and governments would rather pay for special support contracts than update. That hurts Microsoft&#39;s bottom line, of course, but it also poses security risks — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-15-the-wannacry-ransomware-is-a-stark-reminder-of-a-broken-system.html">WannaCry took advantage</a> of organizations running outdated Windows versions. The new OneDrive policy may push some users to install newer Windows versions even if they&#39;re otherwise happy with an old operating system.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-onedrive-windows-7-8-support-end-date-210851189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74ba7724-4838-4ff3-babd-03c3a7dc66f2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 21:08:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636232934</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T21:09:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/034863f0-3f42-11ec-ae75-30d439f4a7f4" width="3840" height="2520" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/034863f0-3f42-11ec-ae75-30d439f4a7f4" width="3840" height="2520" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/06: In this photo illustration, Microsoft OneDrive logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen.

The department spent over $300,000 on two contracts in the past four months to collect data for the sake of investigations.</p><p>One contract, made official in July 2021, gave Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) investigators access to mobile app location data from Babel Street&#39;s Locate X tool. The info will help OFAC target people and enforce international sanctions, according to the contract. As you might expect, there&#39;s a concern the office is effectively circumventing Fourth Amendment search restrictions.

While it&#39;s legal to view that content, the Treasury wants Babel Street to provide &quot;available bio-metric [sic] data&quot; like addresses and marital status that may create a detailed profile.</p><p>The concern isn&#39;t just that the Treasury might be circumventing the Fourth Amendment by obtaining some data (particularly locations) without a warrant. This also represents an expansion of &quot;invasive surveillance,&quot; Tech Inquiry founder Jack Poulson told <em>The Intercept</em>.

You might need to temper your expectations. <em>Android Authority</em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/">tests</a> suggest the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro doesn&#39;t come close to hitting that 30W ceiling.

It&#39;s also important to stress that Google&#39;s marketers don&#39;t promise 30W charging, just the half-hour quick charge.

The buds have the same H1 chip found in the AirPods Pro, allowing them to access features like one-touch pairing and hands-free Siri. But the Beats Fit Pro weren’t without issue: Billy experienced a lot of accidental button presses and they don’t support wireless charging.

However, a larger 6.8-inch screen, smaller bezels, 17 LED backlights, USB-C charging and 32GB of storage make for quite an update, and because of all that, Nathan calls the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition" href="https://amzn.to/3q7rtDL">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> the best e-reader he’s ever used. Those extra LEDs emit an adjustable warm light that should reduce eye strain at night, and Nathan says this was his favorite new feature on the device. He also said the hardware changes to the bezels and screen helped to make this feel like a more premium device.</p><p>The latest Kindle can also automatically adjust the backlight to reduce nighttime eye strain, plus it has wireless charging and won’t display ads on the lock screen. Like previous versions, the Signature Edition is waterproof, can play audiobooks using Bluetooth and has a battery life that lasts weeks. But it comes in at $190, which is $50 more than the standard Kindle Paperwhite. Nathan says that for most people, the extra storage isn’t worth the extra money — unless you plan on downloading a lot of Audible titles on your e-reader.</p><h2>The Panasonic GH5 II <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html">runs on an all-new processor</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/300d7c30-3e62-11ec-aee9-a053bc5b0187" alt="Panasonic GH5 II" data-uuid="deeed504-34d4-3746-99d8-69a98b5cdcf7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent found a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Panasonic GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">Panasonic GH5 II</a>. The refreshed design still has the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, as well as the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification. The body hardware is nearly identical with an excellent grip, logical control positions and a smaller but brighter rear display. However, the new version of the camera has a faster processor and double the refresh rate at 120Hz. The chip helps improve the AI autofocus, which can now double the face- and eye-tracking speeds as well as pick up focus on a face tilted away from the camera.</p><p>Steve also liked the menus better on the GH5 II, which are color coded and tabbed to help you find what you’re looking for. Panasonic also kept the info panel, which shows important settings at a glance. Another upgrade comes in the image stabilization system, which now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection. Thanks to this, Steve said the GH5 II does a better job than competitors at smoothing out walking or running. But there’s still no external RAW video, and low-light shooting remains a weak point.</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html">It&#39;s all about the cameras</a> on the Sony Xperia 1 III</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/648ea5b0-3e62-11ec-9f7f-6f0769f391aa" alt="Sony Xperia 1 II" data-uuid="f6ecd9b9-d9cc-3a49-8ba0-9986fc4c6920"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#x002019;s Xperia 1 III" href="https://amzn.to/3mOu7w8">Sony’s Xperia 1 III</a> closely resembles last year&#39;s smartphone with an unusual 21:9 screen ratio and an elongated design. Mat Smith says the addition of a matte finish helps to make it feel like a premium handset. The updated 4K 120Hz screen also helps make everything look quite crisp, and it runs smoothly thanks to a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Though Mat says the phone&#39;s 6.5-inch OLED screen is gorgeous, the Xperia can’t dynamically change refresh rates to maximize battery life — and that results in barely a full day of use, even with a 4,500mAh battery, if you keep the panel at 120Hz. He was pleased with the sound from the front-facing stereo speakers, which continues support for audio formats like 360 Reality Audio, Hi-Resolution audio and Dolby Atmos. And — shocker — the Xperia 1 III still includes a 3.5mm audio jack.</p><p>But the phone’s camera shines, courtesy of the three 12-megapixel shooters with varying focal lengths. The Xperia 1 III can track moving subjects and catch crisp shots in busy scenes because it’s capable of capturing 20 frames per second and has dual-phase-detection-autofocus pixels. Mat says it’s a more technical approach and it has a learning curve, but it makes the smartphone an intriguing prospect for photography enthusiasts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-the-beats-fit-pro-are-an-intriguing-airpods-pro-alternative-160023697.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">95efa7f5-d8bb-4a96-9a88-7e21c782e5a7</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137402</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:36:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple’s new AirPods in a less polarizing design.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Domestication brought about our best fuzzy friends]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 40,000 years ago, humanity had its best idea to date: transform the age&#39;s apex predator into a sociable and loyal ally. Though early humans largely muddled through the first few thousand years of the process, the results have been nothing short of revolutionary. The practice of domestication underpins our modern world, without which we wouldn&#39;t have dogs or cats or farm animals — or even farms for that matter.

The term is derived from the Latin for “dwelling” or “house”: domus. In its broadest sense, domestication is the process of rendering an animal or plant suitable for or amenable to living in the domus, for being a member of, and living intimately with, the family.</p><p>Even in this general sense, the precise meaning of domestication is elusive. Are plants domesticated? Certainly some of them are spoken of as domesticated, as needing deliberate care and cultivation, and sometimes fertilization, by humans and, conversely, as having been genetically modified through human selection to have traits considered desirable. I am not talking about the relatively recent process of genetically engineering changes to plants; these modified products, such as soybeans, are known colloquially as GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Selection has been carried out for millennia by hunters, gatherers, foragers, gardeners, farmers, and breeders of various species through old-fashioned means, not in the laboratory. If you want, for example, violets with white stripes, what do you do? You try to nurture the seeds of those that show white stripes and pull up the ones that don’t, until you always get striped ones (if you ever do).</p><p>We can understand the general principle of selecting or choosing the most desirable plants — those that yield the most food under particular conditions, for example — but the practice of selection is somewhat paradoxical. The individual plants that produce rich fruits or seeds or tubers are the ones you would most want to eat — and those are the very ones you must save for the next planting season. Which is the most practical strategy? Why did people start saving the best seed? It is an awkward conundrum. As the late Brian Hesse wisely observed in his studies of early domestication, people who are short of food, even starving, do not save food for next season or next year. They simply try to live until next week.</p><p>The habit of saving seeds for another day must have arisen in relatively good times, when food was plentiful enough to keep some for the distant future. This implies that the motivation for domestication is not to ensure a stable food supply because undertaking the initial process of domestication makes sense only if you already have enough food. Plant domestication seems to be about improving the plant species in the long run. But you really don’t care if the plant is happy to see you or plays nicely with the children.</p><p>What is more, strictly speaking, domesticated plants — crops — do not exactly live with humans or in the home. In fact, because some of them, such as nuts and fruits, grow on trees, and most require sunlight, they could not possibly live indoors. Domesticated plants certainly do not participate in family life in any active way, though their needs and locations may shape the seasonal and daily round of activities and the locations of settlements. They don’t join the family. There is an odd sort of remote intimacy between crops and those who harvest or farm them.</p><p>The more you ponder the domestication of plants, the fuzzier the concept of “domesticating” them becomes. The earliest farmers or gardeners did not know enough about the mechanics of reproduction or genetic inheritance to know how to get a particular plant to fertilize some other particular plant and produce bigger corms, or juicier fruits, or non-exploding seed heads (which are easier to harvest), or tubers that were richer in carbohydrates. Domesticating plants was not a matter of learning which individual plants were friendliest or least aggressive toward people. And yet, over time, wisdom accumulated, sometimes accompanied by good luck, and humans did find out how to alter some plants’ genetics to foster a more desirable outcome. This discovery is often spoken of as the Neolithic revolution or the dawn of agriculture. It is generally thought to have occurred around 11,000 years ago. Agriculture as an organized system of growing food transformed at least some people who had traditionally hunted, gathered, and foraged for their daily food — mobile people living off the land — and turned them into more sedentary farmers, tied to fields and villages and dwellings.</p><p>The Neolithic revolution was not a win-win proposition at the outset. Several studies have shown that early farming peoples experienced a decline in their general health because they often had monotonous diets based on a very few staple resources. Having a narrower range of staple foods meant that those people were more vulnerable to normal variations in weather, such as too much or too little rain, or too hot or too cold or too short a growing season; and of course there were plant diseases, which spread easily when a whole field is planted with a single species. Growing crops also caused humans to live in more permanent settlements, which exacerbated problems with sanitation, water supply, and human crowd diseases.</p><p>Though farming supported more people living in higher densities than hunting and foraging, it also created perfect conditions for the spread of contagious diseases and parasites and for recurrent episodes of starvation in bad years. And then there was warfare. Among nomadic foraging and hunting peoples, disputes are often settled by one group moving away from the other. But clearing and fencing fields, planting and tending crops, and building storage facilities takes a lot of work, so people begin to defend territories — or to raid others’ territories when times are bad and their own crops fail. Excess foods, such as the seeds for next year or the vegetables saved for winter, could be stolen during a raid. Abandoning a cleared or planted field and a store of food is an expensive proposition, much more risky than simply shifting your hunting to another area when game gets scarce or your brother-in-law becomes annoying.</p><p>As best we know at present, the domestication of plants began about 11,000 years ago with fig trees, emmer wheat, flax, and peas in the Near East. At about the same time, foxtail millet was domesticated in Asia. How do we know this at  all? We know it because of plant remains preserved under special conditions. Seeds can be preserved and sometimes were.</p><p>Many edible plants also contain starch grains and phytoliths, microscopic silica structures that are much more resistant to decay than leaves or stems. If found, these can also be used to identify plants that were used in the past; techniques such as radiocarbon dating can tell us when this occurred.</p><p>Historically, it was often assumed that plants were domesticated earlier than animals, but modern science shows that this idea is unquestionably mistaken. There is no logical reason why it should be true. The attributes and needs of domesticated crops differ a great deal from those of hunted or gathered foods; knowing how to raise wheat tells you little about how to look after pigs. Like fields, particularly rich hunting grounds could be invaded by others and were worth defending. But many hunters and gatherers or foragers were nomadic and lived in low densities out of necessity. Staying too long in one area depleted the local prey population. Whereas agriculturalists can store crops for the future, hunters cannot store meat for long in temperate or tropical climates, though extreme cold works well to keep meat frozen. Over time, crops are more vulnerable to theft than carcasses.</p><p>Domesticating animals involves other issues. Domestic animals are not normally hunted; indeed, they are not always confined and may be free ranging. Still, domestic animals can be moved to a new area much more easily than a planted field, a store of grain, or a pile of tubers, which simply will not get up and walk to a new locale. Such animals may even transport household goods as they are being moved. Moving domestic animals is a very different proposition from moving plant foods.</p><p>So why do we use the same word, domesticates, to describe both plant and animal species, and a single word, domestication, to describe the process by which an organism becomes domesticated? I think it is a grave mistake that has been based on outdated ideas and faulty assumptions. I do not believe that a single process is involved. I argue that plant and animal domestication are radically different because the nature of the wild species from which domestication might begin is also radically different. As well as having the inherent genetic variability that causes some individuals to exhibit more desirable traits, animals must also cooperate to some extent if they are to be domesticated. Animals choose domestication, if it is to succeed. Plants do not. Like animals, plants have to have enough genetic variability to be exploited by humans during domestication, but plants do not decide whether or not to grow for humans. Animals must decide whether or not to cooperate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-our-oldest-companions-pat-shipman-harvard-university-press-153017333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73927e67-26ab-423b-b6c1-25bf8b447adc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 15:30:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636132480</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T17:14:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bcdf830-3ddc-11ec-bdf7-1994c184c083" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bcdf830-3ddc-11ec-bdf7-1994c184c083" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adria  Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mom Gray Wolf and her newborn pup sharing a tender moment, Quebec, Canada]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Touching scene of Gray Wolf mother with newborn pup]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Stranger Things' season 4 teaser hints at trouble in California (update: release info)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is finally dribbling out more tangible details of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stranger-things-4-teaser-netflix-162844380.html"><em>Stranger Things</em> season 4&#39;s</a> plot.

Amazon has discounted some of its 4-series and Omni 4K TVs, marking the first time they’ve been on sale since the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">introduced them</a> at the start of September. At the moment, you can get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:50-" href="https://amzn.to/3GRBPxn">50-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:55-inch" href="https://amzn.to/3ENjWOy">55-inch</a> Omni models for $360 and $410. Typically, those sets cost $510 and $560, so you’re saving almost 30 percent off the price of both TVs.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ENjWOy" id="932c57b9ee1943409ecd60435201f285" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Omni 55-inch TV">Buy Omni 4K TV (55-inch) at Amazon - $410</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GRBPxn" id="be8a27de5b464ede9de62cf28d71ada1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Omni 4K TV (50-inch) at Amazon - $360</a><p>Both Omni sets feature support for HDR10, HLG and Dolby Digital Plus. They also come with the usual assortment of Fire TV features, and they’re deeply integrated with Amazon’s other products. For example, if you own a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-smart-doorbell-alexa-radar-birds-eye-view-motion-detection-143037689.html">Ring doorbell</a>, you’ll be able to speak to your visitors. You can also connect a web camera to the TVs to use them for both Alexa and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fire-tv-cube-zoom-two-way-calling-212314183.html">Zoom video calling</a>. If you’re in the market for a TV with Dolby Vision, you’ll need to look at the more expensive 65- and 75-inch Omni sets for that feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’d like to spend less on a TV and hands-free Alexa isn’t a selling point for you, Amazon has also discounted its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:50-" href="https://amzn.to/3BPXnH5">50-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:55-inch" href="https://amzn.to/3ENknIG">55-inch</a> 4-series models. They’re currently priced at $330 and $380, down from $470 and $520.

But if you’re primarily looking for an affordable TV that you plan to use exclusively for streaming video, you could do a lot worse than a TV from either the Omni or 4-series families.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-omni-4k-tv-sale-124522590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc854ef0-36fc-49a2-aca1-98301b34ac60</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 12:45:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636201721</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T12:28:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/24cd2b80-3e59-11ec-aff9-7006fd5a3ea3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/24cd2b80-3e59-11ec-aff9-7006fd5a3ea3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Omni TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Omni TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple hires Tesla's director of Autopilot software]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has been incredibly secretive about its efforts to develop a self-driving car, but according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/apple-hires-tesla-s-autopilot-software-director-for-car-effort?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, its latest move is hiring a key personnel from its toughest competition. The tech giant has reportedly hired Christopher &quot;CJ&quot; Moore, who&#39;s been the director for Tesla&#39;s Autopilot Software since 2019 and who&#39;s been with the company since 2014. While Moore has yet to update his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cj-moore-56509b76/">LinkedIn page</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em> says he will also work on software at Apple and will report to Stuart Bowers. Like Moore, Bowers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-27-tesla-executive-hiring-spree.html">worked as Tesla&#39;s</a> head of Autopilot unit until he left in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in May, Moore was one of the employees who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dmv-memo-full-self-driving-171620124.html">told the California DMV</a> that Elon Musk exaggerated the automaker&#39;s full self-driving timeline. In a DMV conference call, he said Musk&#39;s statements that Level 5 automated driving is coming soon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/n6nsmt/elons_tweet_does_not_match_engineering_reality/">didn&#39;t &quot;match engineering reality.&quot;</a> Musk has been saying that Tesla&#39;s technology will soon be able to operate with zero human intervention. At the moment, it&#39;s still only capable of Level 2 self-driving, which still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. Moore was called as a witness in a lawsuit over the death of a man in a 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida. The documents for that lawsuit <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/director-of-autopilot-software-christopher-cj-moore-has-left-tesla/">revealed</a> in early October that Moore had already left Tesla.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Moore and Bowers are just two of the former Tesla employees Apple had hired for its car division. Other hires include Michael Schwekutsch, who used to be Tesla&#39;s VP of Engineering and who worked on drive trains, and Steve MacManus, who was also a Tesla VP of Engineering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-tesla-director-of-autopilot-software-104848566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4d2d409-3bb2-4154-9bf0-2fe719251065</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 10:48:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636195750</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T10:49:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac971fd0-0141-11ec-b7f2-907e31c9afcf" width="8256" height="4640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac971fd0-0141-11ec-b7f2-907e31c9afcf" width="8256" height="4640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Apple store at IFC on August 7, 2021 in Hong Kong, China.

In an interview with <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/alfa-romeo/giulia/356490/alfa-romeo-giulia-will-live-all-electric-saloon"><em><ins>Auto Express</ins></em></a>, Jean-Philippe Imparato, the company’s CEO, said Alfa Romeo would debut the EV sometime in 2024. Additionally, he revealed the car will be built on the STLA Large platform from its parent company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-grand-cherokee-4xe-plug-in-hybrid-141057823.html">Stellantis</a>.</p><p>The conglomerate announced the architecture this past summer. At the time, it said it would allow its cars to go from zero to 60 in as little as two seconds, and allow for a potential range of up to 500 miles. Dodge, one of the other automakers under the Stellantis umbrella, will use the platform in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dodge-muscle-car-ev-161146368.html"><ins>all-electric muscle car</ins></a> it plans to debut in 2024. Alfa Romeo could also offer a Quadrifoglio variant of the Giulia, but Imparato said that will depend on whether it can get the kind of performance that’s associated with the moniker.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Guilia is one part of a more extensive foray into EVs Alfa Romeo has planned for the second half of the decade. “The first full EV will come in 2024 and we’ll see a big launch in 2025, 2026, and we’ll see Alfa Romeo as a full BEV in 2027. This is validated and funded,” Imparato told <em>Auto Express</em>. If it can go fully electric by 2027, Alfa Romeo would be the first Stellantis brand to do so.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alfa-romeo-giulia-bev-2024-224716158.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">31e616a0-6193-45e4-9ef4-f688d1e156c0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 22:47:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636150308</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T22:11:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31634fc0-3e84-11ec-9bde-b273653b7f3d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31634fc0-3e84-11ec-9bde-b273653b7f3d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alfa Romeo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
