Its easy installation process is one of the reasons why we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-174512379.html">score of 80</a> when we first reviewed it, but we also knocked it for its higher price tag. But now you can grab the capable smart lock for $50 less at Amazon while it&#39;s down to a record low of $180. It hasn&#39;t gone on sale like this in months, so now&#39;s the time to buy one if you&#39;ve been eyeing it for a while.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3waADjW" id="1804510b2527417a8ce73efa3d4dd309" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy August WiFi smart lock (4th gen) at Amazon - $180</a><p>August didn&#39;t mess with the good stuff when updating its WiFi smart lock. The fourth-generation device is smaller than the previous and it doesn&#39;t require a bridge thanks to its WiFi connectivity. Like most smart home devices, you&#39;ll follow a few setup videos in the companion mobile app to set the lock up, and during that process you&#39;ll have to turn on two-factor authentication. It&#39;s a necessary step and we were glad to see it as that extra layer of security is important for all connected devices — especially those that lock and unlock your home. And on top of that, the WiFi smart lock also has Bluetooth encryption plus AES 128-bit and TLS encryption.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After setting it up, August&#39;s device can be controlled from its companion app, allowing you to remotely lock and unlock your door. This lets you easily let friends and family members in when you&#39;re not home, and its Auto-Lock feature can detect when you&#39;ve shut the door and automatically secure it. And your old-school keys aren&#39;t suddenly useless either — you can still use them with the WiFi smart lock installed, so if you ever forget to replace the lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries, you can still get into your home.

From tools to tray liners, plus a range of rubs and sauces, the company will sell you everything you need for its grills to smoke a brisket or cook a few dozen wings. Now the company is expanding further to give you literally everything you might need for a full meal, with all of the dishes cooked directly from on its grills. <a href="https://provisions.traeger.com/">Traeger Provisions</a> is a HelloFresh-like meal kit that includes the meat, sides, rubs, sauces and more needed for a complete backyard feast that will feed crowds small and large.</p><p>At launch, the meat options are Wagyu beef brisket, Poulet Rouge chicken and Berkshire St. Louis pork ribs. Traeger says portion sizes for all three will accommodate 4-8 people, depending on the protein. For the brisket, the company also offers an option for 14-16 people (half brisket vs. whole brisket). With the smaller packages, you get the choice of two sides and four come with the big brisket feast. Right now, the options include three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon, collard greens with bacon and cornbread with spiced brown sugar. All of the side dishes come in “Traeger-ready” foil pans, so they’re good to go on the grill quickly. Prices range from $150 to $180 for the smaller packages, while the larger whole brisket box is $250. Shipping is an additional $10.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a1a60-3b82-11ec-9f7d-59bb974b5a0b" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="f2789456-d44e-3e63-ae4c-7cccdcb9a9a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Traeger is also preparing three holiday options for Thanksgiving. These Provisions boxes are more expensive at $220-$250, but the Heritage black turkey, naked turkey breast and rolled and trussed porchetta options will feed 8-10 people according to Traeger. They come with three side dishes instead of two and there are seasonal options like green bean casserole or apricot and bacon stuffing. The two turkey packages can also be upsized for 18-20 people for another $100.</p><p>As you might expect, all of this ships frozen and packed with dry ice. To start, Traeger is shipping the boxes to Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming and Utah. Since the meat and sides will be solid when they arrive, you’ll need to add a few days into your meal planning timeline, and the company offers detailed guidance on how to do exactly that as part of its cooking directions.</p><p>In addition to advice on the thawing process, Traeger includes all of the steps to prep the meat for the grill. That includes any trimming or seasoning that needs to be completed beforehand. The printed directions also guide you through the entire cook, with details on when to wrap (if necessary) and when to put the sides on the grill. It’s basically a paper-based version of Traeger’s app that offers step-by-step instructions with tons of recipes. If you need additional help, the directions have QR codes for videos and more info on tricky steps like trimming a brisket. There’s also guidance for how to prepare and cook the sides, including cooking bacon to mix in or topping a dish with bread crumbs before putting it on the grill. Lastly, supplies like rubs, sauces, pickled veggies, “pitmaster snacks,” gloves and butcher paper are all included. You literally just have to provide the grill and a bag of pellets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d95b321-3b82-11ec-99d7-1bbbdaaeb9a4" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c929b350-8af6-3369-9899-f5f3a741fcfb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I tested out Traeger Provisions with a Wagyu beef brisket Smokehouse Box. I selected the smaller size for 7-8 people, which included a six-pound Brisket, three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon and all of the aforementioned accoutrements. Even though I have experience with barbecue and Traeger’s recipes for its grills, I followed the Provisions directions closely, and the guidance was clear and easy for cooking on the Ironwood 650. I only deviated in an attempt to brown the breadcrumbs on the mac in the oven and popped the beans in there to keep them warm. Cooking steps helped with timing too, which can be difficult when you’re trying to have meat and sides all ready at the same time.</p><p>Obviously, the brisket was the star of the show. Mine was slightly dry as I have a tendency to over trim the extra fat, but that’s a me problem and not an issue with Traeger’s culinary tips. Still, the Wagyu beef was perfectly marbled so the fatty cuts were more forgiving to my butchering mistakes. Those remained quite moist and very tasty. Consensus among my family was that the mac and cheese was also a winner, with the herby, garlicky thick sauce serving as a great complement to the brisket. The baked beans we didn’t care for, but that’s likely because they were more what I’d call “barbeque beans” with a thinner sauce than the thick, molasses-tinged dish we’re used to in the Carolinas. I also enjoyed the “pitmaster snacks,” which included a smoked nut mix and smoked beef jerky.</p><p>The directions helped me time everything perfectly so we weren’t waiting on one thing to finish while the rest got cold. I think the portions are also accurately calculated. Eight servings would’ve been stretching it, but I could have easily gotten six or seven out of the half brisket box. The ribs option also seems okay in terms of portions, but the Poulet Rouge chicken might not. Four half chickens for 6-8 people seems like a stretch unless these are massively huge birds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a4170-3b82-11ec-970f-c7c82d8bde8f" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c518318f-c0be-3fc4-98fc-897f405349d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>So, who are these boxes for?  Most backyard cooks with some experience will likely have their go-to butcher or grocery store for proteins. They probably also have tricks for easy sides so they can focus on the meats. At $150, you’re definitely paying for convenience, in addition to high-quality beef, pork or poultry.</p><p>The ability to have everything you need in one box with detailed directions on how to prepare it can take some of the stress out of party planning. There is some lead time required though, so you can’t grab one of these on Tuesday for a cookout on Saturday. At the end of the day though, I don’t think that price is astronomical based on what Traeger is offering. Is it something you’ll do a lot? No. Will it come in handy in certain circumstances? Absolutely. I can see plenty of people being interested in having most of their Thanksgiving meal planning done with a few clicks.</p><p>I can also see Traeger Provisions serving as a great gift for new grill owners. Sure, it’s a considerable amount to spend on someone, but it would definitely help a novice get their feet wet with some step-by-step oversight. Plus, they might not have all the supplies they need yet — little things like butcher paper and gloves, for example.</p><p>Traeger is now taking orders for its Provisions boxes that will be delivered between November 10th and 14th. If you’re considering one of those Thanksgiving packages, you’ll need to order by November 14th to get it in time. Just remember: Traeger Provisions is only delivering to select states at this time.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="484d0070-87f1-493d-ba2b-79963c895edb"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/traeger-provisions-review-120027663.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d525cb7-8f4d-44b7-95de-46fc365ffc75</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635855499</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:18:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: '5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized disc]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blu-rays are so done.

The new technique has sped this process up substantially, to around 230 KB per second. And, yes, that sounds pretty slow, but it could provide a way to backup data, essentially forever.

Even GM has been offering it for years in its cars with OnStar and recently introduced crash detection to smartphones via the OnStar Guardian app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-i-phone-could-soon-detect-a-car-crash-and-dial-911-automatically-134124164.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sega-microsoft-super-game-partnership-204720764.html"><ins>Sega is making a &#39;Super Game&#39; with Microsoft</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-enabling-a-new-generation-of-touchy-feely-robots-120016974.html"><ins>Facebook is enabling a new generation of touchy-feely robots</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html"><ins>What&#39;s in the Facebook Papers and what it means for the company</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-nest-devices-are-on-sale-on-best-buy-ahead-of-black-friday-091042291.html"><ins>Google&#39;s Nest devices are on sale at Best Buy ahead of Black Friday</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-confirms-pixel-6-pro-display-flickering-issue-will-be-fixed-next-month-122533947.html"><ins>Google confirms Pixel 6 Pro display flickering issue will be fixed next month</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-test-2022-190551476.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Project Kuiper will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2022</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-air-pods-pro-with-magsafe-are-down-to-190-at-best-buy-121010360.html"><ins>Apple&#39;s new AirPods Pro with Magsafe are down to $190 at Best Buy</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-template-5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-a-cd-sized-disc-113702417.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8372c3e5-1971-43c7-9b64-9e4eb89c961c</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 11:37:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635855323</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:15:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Optica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk says Hertz hasn’t actually ordered 100,000 Tesla EVs yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a <a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign">press release</a> from Hertz indicated that the rental company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">placed an order</a> for 100,000 Tesla Model 3s for its rental fleet. Late yesterday, however, Elon Musk tweeted that the order is far from firm, saying that &quot;no contract has been signed yet,&quot; <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-hasnt-signed-a-contract-with-hertz-1847979941"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported.</p><p>Hertz&#39;s announcement stated that it made &quot;a significant investment to offer the largest EV rental fleet in North America...

The phrase &quot;an initial order of 100,000 Tesla&#39;s by the end of 2022&quot; could be taken to mean that the order itself and not the vehicle deliveries will happen at the end of 2022. Tesla itself never responded to the initial news.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk&#39;s tweet came in reply to Twitter user &quot;Tesla Silicon Valley Club,&quot; which was thanking him for Tesla&#39;s recent stock price rise.

There, you&#39;ll find streams of furry/feathered creatures from zoos, conservation habitats and private owners that were previously spread across categories like Travel &amp; Outdoors, Music and Pools, and even ASMR.&nbsp;</p><p>The new space sounds like a perfect antidote other, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html">more stressful</a> Twitch offerings. Some sample streams include an otter enclosure, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter">wolf den</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hoothouselivestream">barn owl</a> breeding habitat and, of course, numerous <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/technicallyoffbeat">kitties</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/themuttmansion">doggos</a>, ducks and bunnies. On top of the live channels, you can see numerous videos and short highlight clips, since the otters or owls might be sleeping on the livestream — though even that can be adorable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of the streams are even interactive, in that you can feed ducks or change turtle habitat lighting by donating Twitch&#39;s Bits currency. If you&#39;re okay something more direct, Twitch also launched some emotes available across channels that can also be unlocked with Bits. All of this could help get resources to conservation and other organizations that need it — it seems a fair trade for some calming, adorable and life-affirming content.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-creates-a-new-category-for-all-its-very-good-animal-livestreams-094054882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e26fb41-cc24-48e0-ad25-fe02280f761f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 09:40:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635844772</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T09:19:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cc1d6d50-3bb6-11ec-addb-565cc660fcc1" width="1306" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cc1d6d50-3bb6-11ec-addb-565cc660fcc1" width="1306" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitch creates a new category for all its Very Good animal livestreams]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitch creates a new category for all its Very Good animal livestreams]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miso Robotics made its Flippy kitchen robot faster and even more autonomous]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2020, Miso Robotics <a href="https://www.engadget.com/your-next-white-castle-slider-could-be-cooked-by-a-robot-090012343.html">teamed up</a> with White Castle to pilot a kitchen robot that can cook sliders called Flippy in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flippy-robot-white-castle-expansion-090002507.html">select locations</a>. Now, thanks to data and employee feedback gathered from the pilot, Miso was able to create a new version of the machine called Flippy 2, which works faster and doesn&#39;t need human intervention. Apparently, one of the main things <a href="https://www.engadget.com/misos-latest-ai-powered-app-can-monitor-burger-and-steak-cooking-times-090035547.html">Miso</a> learned from the pilot was that human assistance was still needed on both sides during operation. Since basket management wasn&#39;t automated, human employees would still need to help load the uncooked product and unload the cooked food in the holding area.&nbsp;</p><p>Miso has designed an &quot;AutoBin&quot; system for the Flippy 2 that solves that problem, specifically for lower volume and specialty foods like onion rings and chicken tenders. The machine&#39;s AI vision can automatically identify the ingredients it&#39;s working with, place them in the right fry basket and then place the cooked food in the holding area. The company says the closed-loop system it creates can increase the kitchen&#39;s throughput by around 60 baskets per hour.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to that upgrade, Flippy 2 also takes up less space than its predecessor. It doesn&#39;t take up as much of the kitchen aisle, is a bit shorter and has fewer overall surfaces that need to be cleaned. After its pilot with White Castle, Miso <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-smarter-more-capable-flippy-robot-knows-how-to-fry-19-things-090044466.html">upgraded</a> the original Flippy with more features, including the ability to adjust the queue to ensure that everything in an order finishes cooking at the same time. However, basket management hasn&#39;t been an automated process until now.</p><p>Mike Bell, CEO of Miso Robotics, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Flippy 2 takes up less space in the kitchen and increases production exponentially with its new basket filling, emptying and returning capabilities. Since Flippy’s inception, our goal has always been to provide a customizable solution that can function harmoniously with any kitchen and without disruption. Flippy 2 has more than 120 configurations built into its technology and is the only robotic fry station currently being produced at scale&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miso-robotics-flippy-2-090049027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a5f9fe9-4eba-495e-88c1-7e08694e66a1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 09:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635856497</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:35:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/152a4b30-3bb7-11ec-bbff-2ba4cea22f28" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/152a4b30-3bb7-11ec-bbff-2ba4cea22f28" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Miso Robotics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Flippy 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Flippy 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Squid Game' cryptocurrency collapses in a $3 million scam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A cryptocurrency inspired by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> successfully enticed enough investors to see its value soar to over $2,800... before its creators cashed out and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/01/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-fears-investors">vanished</a>. The cryptocurrency called $SQUID, which wasn&#39;t officially sanctioned by Netflix, launched in late October and rose up to 310,000 percent in value within just a few days. It was sold supposedly as a way to play an upcoming online game based on the South Korean series, in which people buried in debt are forced to play a deadly game.&nbsp;</p><p>At 5:40AM on Monday morning, however, the coin&#39;s value plummeted to $0, its website disappeared (you can view an <a href="https://archive.md/nF8hP">archive</a> here) and its Twitter account got <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GoGoSquidGame">blocked</a>. As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scammers-make-off-with-2-1-m-1847972824"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> explained, its creators staged what&#39;s called in the crypto world as a &quot;rug pull,&quot; wherein the coin&#39;s creators cash out for real money and disappear. The scammers may have made off with as much as $3.38 million.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were multiple signs that the cryptocurrency was a scam from the start — people merely missed or ignored them, perhaps due to the promise of a game based on the popular Netflix show. Its website was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, and as <em>Gizmodo</em> pointed out, people were able to buy coins but weren&#39;t allowed to sell them.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time a coin based on a pop culture phenomenon was launched, and it won&#39;t be the last. While some may be legit, those interested to invest in them will have to keep an eye out for signs of fraud. Just earlier this year, a cryptocurrency based on <em>The Mandalorian</em> turned out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-influencer-apologizes-after-promoting-scam-mando-1846596562">to be a scam</a>, as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-073957132.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08ab1832-b333-4469-8a5b-1bf78846eaa7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 07:39:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635838897</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T07:41:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5396e290-3ba6-11ec-b7b0-a7fef2d57060" width="1600" height="966" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5396e290-3ba6-11ec-b7b0-a7fef2d57060" width="1600" height="966" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta details its latest efforts to combat climate change as COP26 starts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook&#39;s parent company</a>) has joined other major tech companies in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html">making more climate change pledges</a> as the UN’s COP26 summit commences.

On top of that, in more than a dozen countries, Facebook is expanding its use of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/connecting-people-with-credible-climate-change-information/">labels</a> on climate change posts to direct users to the center.</p><p>The UN will soon update its <a href="https://www.un.org/actnow">ActNow</a> chatbot on Messenger, Instagram and its website to suggest 10 more actions users can take to fight combat change.

Effectively, the sticker acts as both a prompt for other people to upload their own Stories and a way for them to discover new people to follow.

Since then, the documents have made their way into the hands of more than a dozen publications who formed “a consortium,” much to the dismay of Facebook’s PR department.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There have now been more than a hundred stories based on the documents. And while many of those reference the same documents, the details are significant. But as important as they are, it’s also a dizzying amount of information. There are detailed documents written by the company&#39;s researchers, free-form notes and memos, as well as comments and other posts in Workplace, the internal version of Facebook used by its employees.</p><p>This mix of sources, together with the fact that the consortium has not released most of the documents to researchers or other journalists, makes the Facebook Papers difficult to parse. <em>Gizmodo</em> has been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hey-kid-wanna-see-some-leaked-facebook-docs-1847936740"><ins>publishing</ins></a> some of the underlying documents, but new revelations could be trickling out for weeks or months as the material becomes more widely distributed.</p><p>But amid all that noise, a few key themes have emerged, many of which have also been backed up by prior reporting on the company and its policies. This article will detail Haugen’s disclosures, and additional details that have arisen from reporting on the Facebook Papers. We&#39;ll continue to update it as fresh allegations emerge.</p><h2>Facebook allowed politics to influence its decisions</h2><p>This likely won’t be a surprise to anyone who has followed Facebook over the last five years or so, but the Facebook Papers add new evidence to years-long allegations that Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders allowed politics to influence their decisions.</p><p>One of the first stories to break from Haugen’s disclosures (via <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>) included details about Facebook’s “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html"><ins>cross check” program</ins></a>, which allowed politicians, celebrities and other VIPs to skirt the company’s rules. The initial motivation for the program? To avoid the “PR fires” that may occur if the social network were to mistakenly remove something from a famous person’s account. In another document, also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-politics-decision-making-documents-11635100195"><ins>reported by</ins></a><em>The Journal</em>, a researcher on Facebook&#39;s integrity team complained that the company had made “special exceptions” for right-wing publisher <em>Brietbart</em>. The publication, part of Facebook’s official News Tab, also had “managed partner” status, which may have helped the company avoid consequences for sharing misinformation.</p><p>At the same time, while Facebook’s policies were often perceived internally as putting their thumb on the scale in favor of conservatives, Zuckerberg has also been accused of shelving ideas that could have been perceived as benefiting Democrats. The CEO was personally involved in killing a proposal to put a Spanish language version of its voting information center into WhatsApp ahead of the 2020 presidential election, <em>The Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/"><ins>reported</ins></a>. Zuckerberg reportedly said the plan wasn’t “politically neutral.”</p><h2>Facebook has serious moderation failures outside the US and Europe</h2><p>Some of the most damning revelations in the Facebook Papers relate to how the social network handles moderation and safety issues in countries outside of the United States and Europe. The mere fact that Facebook is prone to overlook countries that make up its “rest of world” metrics is not necessarily new. The company&#39;s massive failure in Myanmar, where Facebook-fueled hate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html"><ins>helped incite</ins></a> a genocide, has been well documented for years.</p><p>Yet a 2020 document noted the company still has “significant gaps” in its ability to detect hate speech and other rule-breaking content on its platform. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the company’s AI detection tools — known as “classifiers” — aren’t able to identify misinformation in Burmese. (Again, it’s worth pointing out that a 2018 <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"><ins>report</ins></a> on Facebook’s role in the genocide in Myanmar cited viral misinformation and the lack of Burmese-speaking content moderators as issues the company should address.)</p><p>Unfortunately, Myanmar is far from the only country where Facebook’s under-investment in moderation has contributed to real-world violence. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/business/ethiopia-violence-facebook-papers-cmd-intl/index.html"><ins>notes that</ins></a> Facebook’s own employees have been warning that the social network is being abused by “problematic actors” to incite violence in Ethiopia. Yet Facebook lacked the automated tools to detect hate speech and other inciting content even though it had determined the country was one of the most “at risk” countries.</p><p>Even in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-violence-india-leak-221447186.html"><ins>India</ins></a> — Facebook’s largest market — there’s a lack of adequate language support and resources to enforce the platform’s rules. In one document, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html"><ins>reported by</ins></a><em>The New York Times</em>, a researcher created a test account as an Indian user and started following Facebook’s automated recommendations for accounts and pages to follow. It took just three weeks for a new user’s feed to become flooded with “hate speech, misinformation and celebrations of violence.” At the end of the experiment, the researcher wrote: “I’ve seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I’ve seen in my entire life.” The report was not an outlier. Facebook groups and WhatsApp messages are being used to “spread religious hatred” in the country, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal’s</em> analysis of several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-services-are-used-to-spread-religious-hatred-in-india-internal-documents-show-11635016354"><ins>internal documents</ins></a>.</p><h2>Facebook has misled authorities and the public about its worst problems</h2><p>Lawmakers, activists and other watchdogs have long suspected that Facebook knows far more about issues like misinformation, radicalization and other major problems than it publicly lets on. But many documents within the Facebook Papers paint a startling picture of just how much the company’s researchers know, often long before issues have boiled over into major scandals. That knowledge is often directly at odds with what company officials have publicly claimed.</p><p>For example, in the days after the Jan. 6 insurrection, COO Sheryl Sandberg said that rioters had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html"><ins>“largely”</ins></a> organized using other platforms, not Facebook. Yet a report from the company’s own researchers, which first surfaced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html"><ins>in April</ins></a>, found that the company had missed a number of warning signs about the brewing “Stop the Steal” movement. Though the company had spent months preparing for a chaotic election, including the potential for violence, organizers were able to evade Facebook’s rules by using disappearing Stories and other tactics, according to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-failed-stop-the-steal-insurrection"><em><ins>BuzzFeed</ins></em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Likewise, Facebook’s researchers were internally sounding the alarm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-carols-journey-qanon-reports-005159230.html"><ins>about QAnon</ins></a> more than a year before the company banned the conspiracy movement. A document titled “Carol’s Journey to QAnon” detailed how a “conservative mom” could see QAnon and other conspiracy theories takeover their News Feed in just five days only by liking Pages that Facebook’s algorithms recommended. “Carol’s” experience was hardly an outlier. Researchers ran these types of experiments for years, and repeatedly found that Facebook’s algorithmic recommendations could push users deeper into conspiracies. But much of this research was not acted on until “things had spiraled into a dire state,” one researcher wrote in a document <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581"><ins>reported</ins></a> by <em>NBC News</em>.</p><p>The documents also show how Facebook has misleadingly characterized its ability to combat hate speech. The company has long faced questions about how hate speech spreads on its apps, and the issue sparked a mass <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-does-facebook-ad-boycott-accomplish-231311517.html"><ins>advertiser boycott</ins></a> last year. According to a document cited by Haugen, the company’s own engineers estimate that the company is taking action on “as little as 3-5% of hate” on its platform. That’s in stark contrast to the statistics the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html"><ins>typically showcases</ins></a>.</p><p>Similarly, the Facebook Papers indicate that Facebook’s researchers knew much more about vaccine and COVID-19 misinformation than they would share with the public or officials. The company declined to answer lawmakers’ questions about how COVID-19 misinformation spreads even though, according to <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/28/what-facebook-knew-about-covid-19-misinformation-didnt-tell-congress/"><ins>reporting</ins></a>, “researchers had deep knowledge of how covid and vaccine misinformation moved through the company’s apps.”</p><h2>Facebook has misled advertisers and shareholders</h2><p>These are the allegations that could end up being some of the most consequential because they show serious problems affecting the company’s core business — and could tie into any future SEC action.</p><p>Instagram has long been viewed as a bright spot for Facebook in terms of attracting the teens and younger users Facebook needs to grow. But increasingly, teens and younger users are spending more time and creating more content in competing apps like TikTok. The issue is even more stark for Facebook, where “teen and young adult DAU [daily active users] has been in decline since 2012/2013,” according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline"><ins>slide shared by</ins></a><em>Bloomberg.</em></p><p>The story points out another issue that could get the company into hot water with the SEC: that the company is overcharging advertisers and misrepresenting the size of its user base due to the number of duplicate accounts. Though this is hardly the first time the issue has been raised, the company’s own reports suggest Facebook “undercounts” the metric, known as SUMA (single user multiple account), according to <em>Bloomberg.</em></p><h2>Zuckerberg prioritized growth over safety</h2><p>While the Facebook Papers are far from the first time the company has faced accusations that it puts profit ahead of users’ wellbeing, the documents have shed new light on many of those claims. One point that’s come up repeatedly in the reporting is Zuckerberg’s obsession <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/27/tech/facebook-papers-meaningful-social-interaction-news-feed-math/index.html"><ins>with MSI</ins></a>, or meaningful social interaction. Facebook retooled its News Feed around the metric in 2018 as a strategy to combat declining engagement. But the decisions, meant to make sure Facebook users were seeing more content from friends and family, also made the News Feed angrier and more toxic.</p><p>By optimizing for “engagement,” publishers and other groups learned they could effectively game the company’s algorithms by, well, pissing people off. But politicians learned they could reach more people by posting more negative content, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>. Publishers also complained that the platform was incentivizing more negative and polarizing content. Yet when Zuckerberg was presented with a proposal that found reducing the amount of some re-shared content could reduce misinformation, the CEO “said he didn’t want to pursue it if it reduced user engagement.”</p><p>That wasn’t the only time a Facebook leader was unwilling to make changes that could have a detrimental effect on engagement, even if it would address other serious issues like misinformation. Several documents detail research and concerns about Facebook’s “like” button and other reactions.</p><p>Because the News Feed algorithm prioritized a “reaction” more than a like, it boosted content that received the “angry” reaction even though researchers flagged that these posts were much more likely to be toxic. “Facebook for three years systematically amped up some of the worst of its platform, making it more prominent in users’ feeds and spreading it to a much wider audience,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a> wrote. The company finally stopped giving extra weight to “angry” last September.</p><p>Facebook slow-walked, and in some cases outright killed, proposals from researchers about how to address the flood of anti-vaccine comments on its platform, the <em>AP</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613"><ins>reported</ins></a>.</p><p>The company has also been accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html"><ins>downplaying research</ins></a> that found Instagram can exacerbate mental health issues for some of its teen users. The documents, which were some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html"><ins>first records</ins></a> to emerge from Haugen’s disclosures, forced Facebook to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html"><ins>“pause”</ins></a> work on an Instagram Kids app that had already drawn the attention of 44 state Attorneys General. The research also prompted the first Congressional hearing as a result of Haugen&#39;s whistleblowing.&nbsp;</p><h2>What does all this mean for <del>Facebook</del> Meta?</h2><p>While the Facebook Papers contain a dizzying amount of details about Facebook’s failures and misdeeds, many of the claims are not entirely new allegations. And if there’s one thing Facebook’s history has taught us, it’s that the company has never let a scandal affect its ability <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-facebook-q2-earnings.html"><ins>to make billions of dollars</ins></a>.</p><p>But, there are some signs that Haugen’s disclosures could be different. For one, she has turned over the documents to the SEC, which has the authority to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into the company’s actions. As many experts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/technology/facebook-sec-complaints.html"><ins>pointed out</ins></a>, it’s not clear what could actually come from such an investigation, but it could at the very least force Facebook’s top executives to formally answer detailed questions from the regulator.</p><p>And though Haugen has said she is not in favor of antitrust action against the social network, the FTC has reportedly begun to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ftc-privacy-kids-11635289993?mod=hp_lead_pos3"><ins>take a look</ins></a> at the disclosures. (The FTC is already in the midst of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-asks-for-ftc-antitrust-charges-dismissed-again-180704263.html"><ins>legal battle</ins></a> with Facebook.) Facebook already seems to be reacting as well. The company has asked employees to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/facebook-legal-communications.html"><ins>preserve documents</ins></a> going back to 2016, <em>The New York Times</em> reported this week. There are other, more practical, issues too. The company is reportedly struggling to recruit engineering talent, according <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/facebook-docs-hiring-recruiting-crisishttps://www.protocol.com/workplace/facebook-docs-hiring-recruiting-crisis"><ins>to documents</ins></a> reported by <em>Protocol.</em></p><p>The constant scandals and internal roadblocks have also taken a toll on existing employees. For as much scrutiny as the company has faced externally, the Facebook Papers paint a picture of a company whose employees are at times deeply divided and frustrated. The events of January 6th in particular sparked a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/25/facebook-jan-6-election-claims-516997"><ins>heated debate</ins></a> about Facebook’s role, and how it missed opportunities to recognize the threat of the “Stop the Steal Movement.” But there have been fundamental disagreements between researchers and other staffers, and Facebook’s leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html"><ins>for years</ins></a>.</p><p>As <em>Wired</em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-papers-badge-posts-former-employees/"><ins>points out</ins></a>, the Facebook Papers are full of “badge posts” — Facebook speak for the companywide posts employees write upon their departure from the social network — from “dedicated employees who have concluded that change will not come, or who are at least are too burned out to continue fighting for it.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a08b6343-57e7-4df5-a44d-189e5c0331b3</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:45:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635795252</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T19:34:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f94d7cf0-3b45-11ec-bbff-34186a422de0" width="1800" height="995" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f94d7cf0-3b45-11ec-bbff-34186a422de0" width="1800" height="995" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta (Modified by Engadget)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[What the Facebook Papers means for the company formerly known as Facebook.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zuckerberg metaverse.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s Project Kuiper will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has hit another milestone on the way to its goal of putting 3,236 low Earth orbit to blanket most of the planet with internet access. On Monday, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-announces-plans-and-launch-provider-for-prototype-satellites">filed</a> a license application with the Federal Communications Commission to launch two prototype satellites, KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2. They will feature many of the technologies the company plans to include in the final production variant of its constellation satellite, giving it the chance to test how those systems fare outside of a lab environment. At the same time, the tests will allow it to validate its launch procedures and mission management when it comes time to start putting its full network in orbit.</p><p>&quot;We’ve invented lots of new technology to meet our cost and performance targets for Project Kuiper. All of the systems are testing well in simulated and lab settings, and we’ll soon be ready to see how they perform in space,&quot; said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. &quot;There is no substitute for on-orbit testing, and we expect to learn a lot given the complexity and risk of operating in such a challenging environment.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Amazon, it will launch KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 toward the end of 2022. Once the test is complete, the company plans to deorbit the satellites so they don’t add to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/were-entombing-the-earth-in-an-impenetrable-shell-of-dead-satellites-163002560.html"><ins>junk pile that’s circling the planet</ins></a>. Additionally, one of the satellites will feature a sunshade so Amazon can see if it helps make it less reflective and thereby less visible to telescopes on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>With today’s announcement, Amazon shared it’s working with ABL Space Systems to put KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 in space. The company’s new RS1 rocket will ferry the satellites to orbit. One of the main design features of Amazon’s Kuiper craft is that they’re compatible with multiple launch systems, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-atlas-v-173405832.html"><ins>Atlas V</ins></a> rocket from United Launch Alliance.</p><p>Once it completes the test, Amazon will need to move quickly to put the entire system into space. When the FCC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-065621687.html"><ins>approved its initial plan</ins></a>, the company said it would put half the satellites in orbit by 2026 and the entire constellation by July 30th, 2029.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-test-2022-190551476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">89b47068-2aed-490a-ac9e-fdb10215a4ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:05:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635793497</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T19:05:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chevrolet's 1957 Project X car is now an EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most famous cars <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chevrolet/"><ins>Chevrolet</ins></a> ever built is now an electric vehicle.

Over the decades, it has been used to test a range of power technologies. Before the electric system, it had a Chevy LSX V-8 engine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The car now has a 400-volt electric powertrain with an estimated 340 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque — those are very similar numbers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillacs-lyriq-ev-will-boast-300-plus-miles-of-range-130020680.html">Cadillac&#39;s Lyriq EV</a>. Chevrolet says the battery can store 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The range depends on the quick-change differential that&#39;s fitted, which can be swapped to optimize the car for acceleration or range. Still, Chevy claims the now-EV has &quot;enough range for weekend cruising.&quot;</p><p>Although the car still has the front suspension that was installed in 2007, Cagnazzi Racing made some changes, such as swapping to an electric brake booster and electrohydraulic power steering pump. Some springs have been switched too, as there&#39;s less weight under the hood and more at the rear compared with the previous incarnation. Project X now has the same push-button gear selector as the 2021 Chevrolet Corvette as well.</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-09-chevy-e-10-concept-electric-hot-rod-truck.html">third straight year</a> that Chevy has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-k5-blazer-e-project-191600554.html"><ins>converted a classic car</ins></a> into an EV for SEMA.

The chipmaker says it will <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/01/qualcomm-announces-goal-achieve-net-zero-emissions-2040">achieve net-zero emissions by 2040</a>. Here’s the roadmap the company laid out. By 2030, Qualcomm says it will reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from base 2020 levels. That same year, it plans to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent from where they were in 2020.</p><p>Scope 1 includes all pollution produced directly by the company or any emissions sources it owns or controls. Scope 2, meanwhile, entails indirect emissions created from the electricity, heating and cooling Qualcomm consumes. Lastly, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions produced by its value chain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the context of a company like Qualcomm that relies on TSMC, Samsung and other foundries to produce its chips, reducing its Scope 3 emissions is the most impactful (and difficult) way the company can lessen its impact on the environment.

Facebook shared details of the network in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/october-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/">monthly report</a> on coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.</p><p>In addition to hundreds of fake accounts on its platform, the troll farm also operated a “a complex network of media brands” on Blogspot, Wordpress and Telegram, Facebook said in a statement. Some fake accounts posed as government supporters, while some posed as university students, who led protests against the government in 2018. The fake account also mass-reported activists and other government critics in an attempt to get them banned from Facebook. Beginning in 2019, the group also began &quot;posting and artificially amplifying praise about the Nicaraguan government and the ruling FSLN party.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it’s not the first time Facebook has caught a government running this kind of operation, Facebook said the Nicaraguan effort was unique because they were able to link it to multiple government institutions, including the Social Security Institute and Supreme Court. The country’s post office headquarters Managua served as a “main hub” for the troll farm, and government workers even appeared to post on a regular 9am-5pm schedule.</p><p>“This was really the closest thing we&#39;ve yet seen to a whole-of-government operation,” Facebook’s Global Threat Intelligence Lead for Influence Operations, Ben Nimmo, said during a call with reporters. “This is the first time that I can think of [that] we&#39;ve seen so many different institutions getting involved.”</p><p>It’s also notable that Facebook traced the start of the operation back to 2018, meaning much of the activity went undetected for years. Nimmo noted that while the company’s automated systems were able to detect and disable some of the fake accounts in 2018, the operation was “complex” and time-consuming to investigate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-takes-down-government-run-troll-farm-in-nicaragua-173235024.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cae1a942-db7a-4059-a195-dae56b5b36e1</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:32:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635787956</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T17:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook logo and new company brand Meta Platforms Inc. logo are pictured in this illustrative photo taken in Kyiv on 29 October, 2021.

I wish that anyone — <em>anyone</em> — other than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-adidas-algae-yeezys.html">Kanye West</a> had released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kanye-west-donda-stem-player-164315448.html">Stem Player</a>. At this point he’s more than 10 years past the creative zenith of <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, and five years removed from the uneven, but decent <em>Life of Pablo.</em> These days, his cultural relevance is driven more by spectacle and controversy than artistic output.</p><p>Still, I can’t help but be drawn to the <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/">Donda Stem Player</a>: It’s a fascinating and unique device. But my interest is in spite of, not because of Kanye West.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85bc380-3990-11ec-a6f7-3bc4fed2e03f" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="0e996dc4-3772-3f18-b75c-ba985033d2f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>So what is it? Well, it’s basically a tiny puck-shaped computer dedicated specifically to remixing Kanye’s latest album. Using it you can change the volume of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/courtney-barnett-stem-mixer-155740890.html">different stems</a>, or tracks, in the songs on Donda. For instance, if you’re wondering what “Off the Grid” would sound like as an instrumental you can simply turn down the vocals. Or if you find the sonar ping synth in “Jonah” unbearable, just turn it off. You can also create loops of little song chunks, reverse them, speed them up, slow them down and even add effects.</p><p>It looks kinda like a sex toy, though, and is covered in what I assume are surplus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-13-finally-a-good-digital-masturbator.html">Fleshlights</a>. It doesn’t feel unpleasant, exactly, but it is slightly unnerving. And the vaguely fleshy hue doesn’t help matters. The main controls on the front are four touch-sensitive strips that light up to tell you what volume a track is at or what effect you’ve selected, for instance. The whole thing vibrates, too, with haptic feedback every time you touch a button or a strip, though it can lag behind your actual touch quite a bit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8494cf0-3990-11ec-b77d-629ae32a9a10" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="bea7553a-5d92-3dee-8fea-9cb7ffa35154"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the limitations here is that it tops out at four stems. This often means all the melodic content is one track. I’ll also say that the effect selection leaves something to be desired. There are two different speeds of tremolo, a few different echo options and “feedback” which is basically just an out of control echo.</p><p>Being able to quickly loop a chunk of music, reverse and slap some reverb on it is kinda fun. It allows you to transform a song into something completely unrecognizable, but it’s not super useful as a practical remix tool.</p><p>I was somewhat disappointed by the Stem Player’s ability to handle non-<em>Donda</em> tracks. The site promises that you can upload any song to the player. You can even drop in a YouTube link and it will parse out the audio. Then it will automatically split the song into stems so you can remix it. This is no easy task, even for pro-grade software on a high-powered PC. Predictably, it&#39;s hit or miss here.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85c38b1-3990-11ec-8ff3-0c31daadcdbc" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="8f4e47a7-6380-34e5-8b2a-cbbfd18622ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Stem Player handled “DIRTY!” from JPEGMAFIA and “Stonefruit” by Armand Hammer reasonably well, though there was some slight bleed through of the synth line into the vocal stem on “Stonefruit.” Nine Inch Nail’s “Closer” fared a little worse. Half the bass line was on its own track, while the other half was lumped in with the drums. It even bled into the vocals. There was also a decent amount of digital artifacts in the stems.</p><p>It would seem that fairly stripped-down hip hop productions will do ok, but as the complexity of a song increases the Stem Player starts to struggle parsing the different parts. The Armed’s “An Iteration,” for example, was broken down into drums, vocals and a single track of everything else. Then the fourth stem, which is supposed to be for bass, was basically silent. In fact, I often encountered this issue with music I uploaded to the Stem Player myself. Badbadnotgood’s “Love Proceeding” was reduced to just two stems: drums and not drums.</p><section data-eng-breakout="41fe1a0726fd49659a0d06206d024cd5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85b9c73-3990-11ec-b7df-a16192ba21a4" alt="Donda Stem Player"></section><p>I have concerns about what happens to the Stem Player in a few years or even months time, too. The only way to upload new songs to it is through the <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/">Stem Player</a> website. So if that ever goes offline you might be stuck. I also can’t figure out how to get mixes and songs off the player. The instructions both included with the player and on the site are pretty barebones and at times, slightly confusing. In the FAQ it says you can save what you’re mixing by pressing the volume up button then it explains that “four recordings can be saved, play back from the final, red track.” The only problem is, I have no idea what the hell that means.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest knock against the Stem Player is the price. $200 is a lot to throw at a musical curiosity. Especially when that money mostly serves to feed the ego of one of the most megalomaniacal celebrities in the world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/donda-stem-player-kanye-west-kano-hands-on-150038410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ece58306-327e-404d-9ac5-a66e76fc373d</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 15:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635770595</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:43:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26c39f00-3b11-11ec-b7bd-01f83d267b57" width="703" height="469" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85c38b2-3990-11ec-86af-8d8d64e49889" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Donda Stem Player]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Donda Stem Player]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon begins early Black Friday sales on its own devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Black Friday is over three weeks away, some major retailers are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-early-black-friday-tech-deals-so-far-november-1-2021-amazon-best-buy-123511788.html"><ins>getting in on the action early</ins></a>.

After some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-leak-191933131.html">early hints</a> in iOS 15.1, the company has formally announced the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3pUcWLk">Beats Fit Pro</a>. This set of true wireless earbuds has a similar look to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> that debuted earlier this year with an added fit wing, or &quot;wingtip&quot; as the company calls it. Combined with an IPX4 rating, the $200 Fit Pro are well-suited for workouts but are also packed with the best features from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">Apple&#39;s new AirPods</a> for all-day use.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to Apple&#39;s H1 chip, the Beats Fit Pro offers hands-free access to Siri, one-touch pairing, the latest Find My features in iOS, automatic device switching and audio sharing. Apple&#39;s fancy new skin detection sensor that improves the accuracy of automatic pausing is also on board. Beats says H1 also powers the ear tip fit test that&#39;s built into the earbuds&#39; settings through iOS. The Beats Fit Pro also have Adaptive EQ like the latest AirPods, a feature that continuously scans and adjusts low- and mid-range frequencies using computational audio and in-ward facing mics. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">Spatial audio</a> and dynamic head tracking, also key elements of Apple&#39;s new earbuds, are available on the Beats Fit Pro as well. This gives you the option of Dolby Atmos in both Apple Music or while you&#39;re watching movies and shows.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80e532f0-3b11-11ec-8dbf-f02e57471607" alt="Beats Fit Pro" data-uuid="7a326458-12a9-39c6-9e5c-1377746a8add"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Beats</div></figure><p>The Beats Fit Pro go beyond the new AirPods with active noise cancellation (ANC). The company says its ANC setup &quot;continuously adapts in real time,&quot; scanning and adjusting up to 200 times per second to counter any changes &quot;in fit and movement.&quot; There&#39;s also a transparency mode that allows you to hear what&#39;s going on around you when needed. With both ANC and transparency turned off, Adaptive EQ takes over to keep things sounding as good as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Beats says new custom transducer and vent system have helped improve overall audio quality. There&#39;s also a new acoustic design that delivers what the company describes as &quot;impressive dynamic range and clarity across the frequency curve.&quot; On the outside, on-board controls give you the ability to play music and take calls without reaching for your phone. Beats gives you the option to customize the long press action for on-board volume control if you&#39;d prefer that to easy access to noise control (ANC, transparency and off). During calls, the company says beamforming microphones focus on your voice while internal mics and an accelerometer work to filter out environmental noise. Spatial audio in Group FaceTime won&#39;t be available on the Beats Fit Pro at launch, but the feature will come in a future update.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/923e9320-3b11-11ec-bf1b-95650fbef9f8" alt="Beats Fit Pro" data-uuid="9b06a1a5-696e-3654-8a80-e062bae96403"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Beats</div></figure><p>Beats is promising up to six hours of listening time with ANC or transparency mode active, plus another 21 hours in the charging case. When you turn those off and use the Fit Pro in Adaptive EQ mode you can expect up to seven hours on the buds with 27 more in the case. The case doesn&#39;t support wireless charging but it does offer a Fast Fuel feature that gives you an hour of play time in five minutes. While everything iOS users need for the Beats Fit Pro is built into that software, Android users will need to download the Beats app. The app offers one-touch pairing, the fit test, the ability to change listening modes and customization of the long press action.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3pUcWLk">Beats Fit Pro</a> are available for pre-order today for $200 from Apple&#39;s website and other retailers in the US. Color options include black, white, grey and purple. The earbuds will begin shipping on November 5th with availability in China in early December. Beats says the Fit Pro will be available &quot;in additional regions&quot; next year.

Today the company officially debuted its latest model: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$200 Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3nNxsL5">$200 Beats Fit Pro</a>. With a similar design to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> that arrived earlier this year, this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-announced-specs-price-availability-140008207.html">new pair</a> offers active noise cancellation (ANC) alongside almost all of the features from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">Apple’s third-generation AirPods</a>. That includes hands-free Siri, Adaptive EQ, spatial audio and more. Beats has also added a wing for a more secure fit during workouts and kept the IPX4 rating from the Studio Buds. All of those features, combined with a more attractive design, gives the company an alternative to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-beats-powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> in its lineup.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>If you’re thinking the Beats Fit Pro look almost exactly like the Beats Studio Buds, you’re not wrong. This new model is a smidge larger and the angle of the tab that holds the on-board controls is slightly different. The overall aesthetic and shape are pretty much identical, though. The biggest design difference is the fit wing, or wingtip as Beats calls it. Unlike a lot of sporty earbuds, this element is very flexible so it can bend to fit a greater range of ear shapes. That also makes it more comfortable. Even though the wing is helping keep the buds in place, you hardly know it’s there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the Studio Buds, the on-board controls for the Beats Fit Pro are on the lowercase ‘b’ logo on the outside of each earbud. They’re still physical buttons you have to press rather than touch controls built for tapping. Controls are mirrored on each side by default, with options for play/pause and answering calls (single press) in addition to skipping tracks (twice for forward, three times for back) and cycling between ANC on and transparency mode (long press). The long press can be reconfigured for volume control, allowing you to turn it up on one side and down on the other. If you do this, you lose the ability to access noise cancellation or ambient sound mode. Bummer.</p><p>Beats says it strategically positioned the button for the on-board controls at the bottom of the hump on each earbud “to avoid accidental presses.” Just like I encountered on the Studio Buds, I frequently activated the controls when trying to adjust the fit of the earbuds. With the wingtip I had to do this less often than the previous model, but it was still annoying to want to secure the buds in my ear only to errantly pause the audio or change the noise control mode. And due to the positioning of the microphones, any fit adjustment usually meant touching the external mics and creating extra noise.</p><p>Apple’s new wear detection sensor sits around back. Like the tech on the new AirPods, the Beats Fit Pro have an optical sensor outfitted with wavelength LEDs that can determine if an object is skin in addition to proximity. Both Apple and Beats explain that this makes the automatic pausing more accurate, avoiding accidental activation when you don’t actually have them in your ear. Of course, this also helps save battery life when you’re less likely to erroneously turn them on.</p><h2><strong>Software and features</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/15229d90-3b08-11ec-b8db-a2e2b6e37794" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="0308597c-1623-306d-8106-2d1cc02c9034"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thanks to Apple’s H1 chip, the Beats Fit Pro have a lot of the same features as the new AirPods. Those include one-touch pairing, where even the first time you open the case, all you have to do is tap a pop-up on your iPhone and the earbuds are connected. Messing with a Bluetooth menu and putting a device in pairing mode are both relics of a bygone era. H1 also powers hands-free Siri and Apple’s enhanced Find My features. Lastly, you get Audio Sharing too, so you can listen to music or watch a movie with someone who has a set of earbuds or headphones made by Apple or Beats.</p><p>In terms of software, everything you need for Beats Fit Pro is built into iOS 15 for iPhone users. From Control Center, you can easily access noise control and spatial audio settings with a long press on the volume slider. You can reassign the press-and-hold on-board control from the ‘i’ icon next to the device name in the Bluetooth menu. An ear tip fit test resides there too, just like it does for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a>, and you can disable automatic ear detection as well. Noise and spatial audio controls are located on this menu too if you’d prefer to access them here. On Android devices, Beats has a dedicated app that handles fast pairing and includes the ear tip fit test, control customization and battery status features available on iOS.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="3e46730b-2d43-3731-ba06-96f19bd77d5b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats says it completely redesigned its proprietary transducer for the Fit Pro, creating “an entirely custom acoustic architecture” and promising balanced and powerful sound. That last bit is immediately apparent the first time you fire up these earbuds. There’s much more low-end tone on this model than what the Studio Buds offer. The punchier bass establishes more depth as well, so there’s more room for vocals, instruments and other elements to come through without sounding compressed or boring.</p><p>Indeed, guitars ring out in the chaotic metal of Every Time I Die, with bombastic drums booming underneath. The bass is ample and never overpowers, even with genres where things can get out of hand quickly when the tuning is the slightest bit off. There’s a clarity on the Fit Pro that’s well suited for genres like blues, bluegrass, ambient, electronic and more. Across all of those genres, the crisp details highlight Beats’ full range of tones. Bass, fiddle, guitar and mandolin all stand on their own for acts like Nickel Creek, giving space for each to shine. There’s no doubt the sound profile here is an improvement over the Studio Buds, but it’s not on the level of pricer sets like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">MW08</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html">Momentum True Wireless 2</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4</a>.</p><p>Thanks to the H1 chip, Beats Fit Pro work with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">Apple’s spatial audio</a>. This gives you the ability to listen to Dolby Atmos Music content in Apple Music — with or without dynamic head tracking enabled. Spatial audio is also available for these earbuds on Apple TV or movies and TV shows streamed iPhone or iPad. Like the latest AirPods, the Fit Pro are equipped with Apple’s Adaptive EQ. This feature is active when you disable both ANC and transparency mode, continuously monitoring sound with internal microphones and adjusting the low- and mid-range frequencies to keep the audio quality consistent. The feature also takes into account the shape of your ear when making its tweaks.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="cb520cc2-4e64-47fa-a3c3-a1a89a5da6e7"/><p>As I’ve already mentioned, the Beats Fit Pro have active noise cancellation on board. It’s another feature powered by Apple’s H1 chip and it, too, adapts to both ambient noise and how the earbuds fit in your ears. Like previous Beats headphones, this tech continuously monitors and automatically adjusts based on the environmental clamor. Beats says the system is powered by an algorithm that can adapt the signal 200 times per second. That looks nice on paper, but at the end of the day, all you need to know is the ANC system on the Fit Pro does a solid job of blocking distractions when you need it to. It’s not as powerful as Bose or Sony, but it counters distractions well enough to come in handy.</p><p>As is typically the case with noise-cancelling earbuds these days, the Fit Pro also offer a transparency mode for tuning into your surroundings. There’s no denying this tool is helpful in certain scenarios when you need to pay some attention to what’s going on around you. However, like the Studio Buds, these don’t feed your voice back into the earbuds when you talk, so you have to speak up to hear yourself. Still, transparency mode will help you keep an ear out for your name at a coffee shop.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1515f360-3b08-11ec-bbff-df8dcbd12571" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="664da67f-6bc1-398e-8ea2-6816c0f22ac1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For calls, Beats equipped the Fit Pro with six microphones: three on each side. External beamforming mics focus on your voice while the internal units for ANC, transparency mode and Adaptive EQ pull double duty to help improve calls. The company says the feed-forward microphones are recessed to avoid wind issues and a voice accelerometer counters external noise with the help of “an advanced algorithm.”</p><p>All earbud companies make some version of this pitch with a mix of mics, algorithms and strategic placement. Mileage varies greatly with these promises and more often than not they don’t hold up. With the Fit Pro, your voice sounds better than speakerphone, but it comes across muffled on the other end. The person you’re speaking to will also get ample background noise if it’s loud enough. At the end of the day, these will work fine if you’re in a decently quiet space, but don’t expect them to block out a noisy office when you have a phone or video call.</p><p>When they first arrive, the Beats Fit Pro won’t support Apple’s new Group FaceTime spatial audio. The feature employs immersive sound so that participants sound like they’re speaking from the location they are on your screen. Apple says this makes FaceTime calls more natural, and it does to a degree. It definitely enhances the experience of a meeting or group chat, but it’s still far from real life. Beats says it plans to add this feature to the Fit Pro as part of a future software update.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Beats is promising up to six hours of use on the earbuds with ANC or transparency mode active. When you factor in the additional 21 hours in the case, that’s 27 hours of listening time with the most attractive features turned on. If you opt to skip those and go with Adaptive EQ mode, you can expect an extra hour on the Beats Fit Pro and three more in the case for a total of 30. As always, the company has included its Fast Fuel feature that offers an hour of noise-cancelling playback with a five-minute charge.</p><p>Battery life claims are rarely an issue with Beats gear and that holds true here. Using a mix of active noise cancellation and transparency mode throughout the day, I managed nearly seven hours before completely depleting the power. I missed it by about 10 minutes. That’s enough to get you through a full day at the office, and if you can dock the buds at some point, you’ll have no trouble wearing them during your commute either. All of these figures are on par with the new AirPods, but Apple’s latest don’t have ANC. Our current top pick for best earbuds, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM4</a>, lasted seven and a half hours during my tests with noise cancellation active.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517c821-3b08-11ec-abff-1c411818f31c" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="c4541c43-00b5-3854-81fb-2809a38776c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats has a more affordable alternative to the Fit Pro in its lineup. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> will save you $50, but you’ll have to make some sacrifices. First, and perhaps most importantly, the sound quality isn’t nearly as good. It lacks the punchy bass and overall depth the Fit Pro exhibits. The Studio Buds don’t have Apple’s H1 chip, but you still get quick pairing and hands-free Siri in addition to the ability to listen to Dolby Atmos tunes in Apple Music. What you won’t find is Adaptive EQ or the new skin-activated wear detection sensor.</p><p>The absolute best true wireless earbuds you can buy right now are still the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony WF-1000XM4</a>. As feature-packed as the Fit Pro are, the handy features are most useful for iOS. Sony goes beyond ANC to include automatic pausing when you speak and quick attention mode for short conversations. You can also fully automate your noise-cancelling or transparency levels on the WF-1000XM4 based on your activity or location. Of course, that’s if you’re willing to trade some privacy for convenience.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for the best of what AirPods has to offer in earbuds that don’t have the polarizing stick apparatus, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3nNxsL5">Beats Fit Pro</a> should do the trick. They offer a nice blend of features, sound and noise-cancelling performance for the price. Sure, there are better options but they also cost significantly more, especially if you’re looking for the absolute best audio quality. For now, Beats is giving the masses an AirPods alternative that’s actually still packed with Apple tech. And that’s an interesting proposition for iPhone owners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0d8fb3fc-c497-4401-b9bb-955dd028baed</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635775793</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T14:09:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fafc5220-3b08-11ec-ad9d-4be2ad921dcb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fafc5220-3b08-11ec-ad9d-4be2ad921dcb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple’s new AirPods in a less polarizing design.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro review]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
