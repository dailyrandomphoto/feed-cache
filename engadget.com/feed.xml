Ludwig is perhaps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-record-broken-234452712.html">best known</a> for his marathon streaming session that allowed him to break the Twitch all-time subscriber record held by Ninja, eventually hitting 283,066 all-time active subs.</p><p>Ludwig broke the news in an amusing Twitter video that showed him driving with his manager &quot;Slime&quot; in a purple car that eventually explodes after they get out. He then jumps into a red model, driving home the point that he&#39;s leaving team purple for team red. &quot;It&#39;s pretty much the same one,&quot; says Slime. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s just like a different color,&quot; Ludwig replies. (&quot;We actually blew up a car and one-take-jaked it,&quot; Slime <a href="https://twitter.com/slime_machine/status/1465443065020092417">tweeted</a> separately.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b98aac5ec0994f7b85ffe088e5c9351a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIliHG_yo7w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In a reply on Twitter, Twitch said &quot;You&#39;re a mogul in every sense, Ludwig. Best of luck and keep doing big things out there. However, the site has been bleeding talent to its rival of late. Ludwig&#39;s departure follows recent moves to YouTube Gaming by Benjamin Lupo (&quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">DrLupo</a>&quot;) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html">TimTheTatMan</a> (Tim Betar), along with previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-youtube-lazarbeam-muselk-valkyrae-exclusive.html">defections</a> by big-name streamers Lannan &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw1SQ6QRRtfAhrN_cjkrOgA">LazarBeam</a>&quot; Eacott, Elliott &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrMuselk">Muselk</a>&quot; Watkins and Rachell &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxlUwW9BgGISaakjGM37aw">Valkyrae</a>&quot; Hofstetter. Jack &quot;CouRage&quot; Dunlop also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-courage-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusive-streaming.html">jumped ship</a> in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4C7ugBXUkY">separate video</a> explaining the move, Ludwig said that he first spoke to YouTube gaming as &quot;leverage&quot; but planned to stay with Twitch &quot;because I&#39;m a Twitch guy.&quot; However, he later realized that YouTube made more sense, in part because he wants to produce content like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDqduef5LE">Mogul Money</a> on top of game react videos.&nbsp;</p><p>He also noted that if he had stayed with Twitch, &quot;I would have to be grinding hours,&quot; and that &quot;I loved Twitch, but it wasn&#39;t necessarily a two-way street.&quot; Finally, he said that while the change wasn&#39;t necessarily about money, &quot;YouTube offered me more money. Straight up.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/record-breaking-twitch-streamer-ludwig-is-moving-to-you-tube-131556917.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f5f8ebcc-9460-4a40-9159-f9ca32a80df2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 13:15:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638277745</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T13:09:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff887d00-51dd-11ec-aef6-73ce0fdf34bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff887d00-51dd-11ec-aef6-73ce0fdf34bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ludwig Ahgren]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Big name Twitch streamer Ludwig Ahgren is switching to YouTube Gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Big name Twitch streamer Ludwig Ahgren is switching to YouTube Gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Watch Active 2 drops to an all-time low of $149]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you weren&#39;t able to grab a smartwatch this past Black Friday and Cyber Monday, here&#39;s a deal you may want to take a note of: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Watch Active 2" href="https://amzn.to/3o8g6tW">Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Watch Active 2</a> is currently available for only $149 on Amazon.

The good news is that the Watch Active 2 is a solid smartwatch, as well. In our review, we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-price-release-date.html">praised</a> it for having better health tracking capabilities than its predecessor, thanks to its upgraded sensors. The one for heart rate measurements contain twice as many LEDs, for instance, giving it the power to determine your heart rate faster. Its accelerometer is also apparently twice as sensitive than the first Watch Active, making it better at sensing whether you&#39;re moving.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the watch doesn&#39;t have a physical rotating wheel, its bezel is touch-sensitive (with haptic feedback) and can be easily used for navigation. We also found Tizen OS easy to use, responsive and proactive with its various reminders. Overall, we concluded that the Watch Active 2 is a well-rounded choice that offers a lot for its price point. That was when the watch sold for $280 a piece, so $149 is a steal if you&#39;ve been eyeing the wearable for quite some time.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The new vehicle is a plug-in hybrid model called the Concept XM, and it&#39;s apparently the most powerful BMW M car to ever go into series production. It will use the company&#39;s newly developed M Hybrid drive system that combines a V8 engine with a high-performance electric motor. That will give the vehicle an all-electric range of 80km (50 miles), the capability to make 750 horsepower and to reach peak torque of 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft).</p><p>In addition to being the second-ever pure M model, Concept XM is also the subsidiary&#39;s first electrified vehicle in the high-performance segment. That &quot;points the way for the future of the M brand,&quot; the company&#39;s announcement says, which hints at more electric-powered cars in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will be the first car to sport BMW&#39;s new front-end design, as well. Based on Concept XM&#39;s images, BMW&#39;s front ends will have split headlights and near-octagonal kidney grills between them bearing the vehicle&#39;s logo. The company calls the vehicle&#39;s overall design &quot;a highly progressive and distinctive take on BMW X,&quot; but not everyone would use those adjectives to describe it —  <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/suvs/new-bmw-concept-xm-most-powerful-m-car-ever-built"><em>BBC&#39;s Top Gear</em></a> sounds downright disappointed with how it looks. Inside, there&#39;s a driver-focused cockpit, brown leather and BMW&#39;s curved screen for its infotainment system.&nbsp;</p><p>The series production version of the vehicle — the BMW XM — will start production by the end of 2022. It will be manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the USA and will be available as a plug-in hybrid model only.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4eb74830-51ce-11ec-b12f-3e200518ee9b" style="height:1060;width:1600;" alt="BMW" data-uuid="2dc4102a-c611-3f14-b164-4fc36a5aa0e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-m-concept-xm-plug-in-hybrid-115542431.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">534304e6-331a-40b9-a130-daf15ce194b7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 11:55:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638271043</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:17:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/90daa1d0-51c4-11ec-bfb1-c53fb25b212e" width="1600" height="1011" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/90daa1d0-51c4-11ec-bfb1-c53fb25b212e" width="1600" height="1011" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK competition regulator orders Meta to sell Giphy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-giphy-deal-antitrust-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-190016371.html">rumored</a>, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-giphy-deal-antitrust-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-190016371.htmlhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">ordered</a> Meta (Facebook) to sell Giphy, saying the deal &quot;could harm social media users and UK advertisers.&quot; It found that the deal would boost Meta&#39;s already prodigious market power by limiting other platforms&#39; access to Giphy GIFs, &quot;driving more traffic to Facebook owned sites — Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The CMA said that Meta&#39;s sites dominated social media user time to the tune of 73 percent and that it could further muscle out rivals like TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat by leveraging Giphy. It added that prior to the merger, Giphy launched &quot;innovative advertising services&quot; used by brands like Dunkin&#39; Donuts and Pepsi that it could have brought to the UK.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Facebook terminated&nbsp;Giphy’s advertising&nbsp;services at the time of the merger,&nbsp;removing&nbsp;an important source of potential competition,&quot; the regulator wrote.&nbsp;&quot;The CMA considers this particularly concerning given that Facebook&nbsp;controls nearly half&nbsp;of the £7 billion display advertising market in the UK.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal.</p></blockquote><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">purchased Giphy</a> in May of 2020, reportedly for $400 million, with the aim of integrating it into Instagram. A month later, the CMA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">launched</a> an investigation into the deal and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html">ruled in August</a> that Facebook could stop rivals like TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy&#39;s GIF library. At the same time, it said the deal could remove potential UK display advertising competitors after Meta ended Giphy&#39;s paid ad partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta previously said that the CMA had no jurisdiction because Giphy has no operations in the UK, adding that Giphy&#39;s paid services weren&#39;t display advertising by the CMA&#39;s definition. In October, the authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-fines-facebook-70-million-for-breaking-rules-related-to-its-giphy-purchase-110227187.html">fined Meta</a> $70 million for breaking rules related to the deal by refusing to report required information and changing its chief compliance officer twice without permission.&nbsp;</p><p>The CMA said that after consulting with interested businesses and organizations, it &quot;has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.&quot;  It&#39;s not clear how this would be done, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resource,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-orders-facebook-to-sell-giphy-111540661.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9697fa4-b0c8-4fb3-a9d1-9a74fa124b01</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 11:15:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638270957</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:16:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/81aae620-51c9-11ec-bbf5-509a149a9779" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/81aae620-51c9-11ec-bbf5-509a149a9779" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 20: In this illustration photo, Facebook and Giphy logos are displayed on a laptop and a mobile phone screen in Ankara, Turkey on May 20, 2020.

It said that Clearview allegedly failed to inform citizens that it was collecting billions of their photos, among other transgressions. It has also (again, provisionally) ordered it to stop further processing of residents&#39; personal data.</p><p>The regulator said that Clearview apparently failed to process people&#39;s data &quot;in a way that they likely expect or that is fair.&quot; It also alleged that the company failed to have a lawful reason to collect the data, didn&#39;t meet GDPR standards for biometric data, failed to have a process that prevents data from being retained indefinitely and failed to inform UK residents what was happening to their data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ICO noted that Clearview&#39;s services were used on a free trial basis by a number of UK law enforcement agencies, &quot;but that this trial was discontinued and Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>The images in Clearview AI Inc’s database are likely to include the data of a substantial number of people from the UK and may have been gathered without people’s knowledge from publicly available information online, including social media platforms.</p></blockquote><p>The UK and Australia opened up a joint investigation of Clearview AI <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-investigation-australia-uk-142825168.html">last year</a>. Regulators were concerned with Clearview&#39;s practice of scraping data and gathering photos from social media site like Facebook. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-18-law-enforcement-using-clearwater-ai-facial-recognition.html">sells</a> that data to law enforcement agencies, purportedly allowing them to identify criminals or victims. However, the company&#39;s business practices have raised numerous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-clearview-ai-police-surveillance-explained.html">privacy concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearview AI said it was considering an appeal, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/clearview-ai-uk-privacy-fine.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. &quot;[Clearview only] provides publicly available information from the internet to law enforcement agencies,&quot; said company lawyer Kelly Hagedorn in a statement. &quot;My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts,&quot; added Clearview AI chief executive Hoan Ton-That in a separate statement.</p><p>Earlier this month, Australia&#39;s regular issued a similar ruling, saying Clearview AI breached the privacy of residents by scraping their biometric information. The country&#39;s regulator, the OAIC, ordered Clearview to &quot;cease collecting facial images and biometric templates from individuals in Australia and destroy all facial images and biometric templates collected.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the US, the ACLU recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aclu-sues-clearview-ai-164518487.html">sued</a> Clearview for violating Illinois state laws. Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-05-google-tells-clearview-at-stop-scraping-photos.html">Google</a> and YouTube have all sent cease-and-desist letters to the company, alleging that it violates their terms of service. Facebook has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-facebook-venmo-cease-and-desist-clearview-ai.html">demanded</a> that Clearview stop scraping its data.&nbsp;</p><p>The fine would be the first Clearview has faced, the company told the <em>NYT.</em> It can still contest the ruling with the Commissioner, so the fine and enforcement &quot;may be subject to change,&quot; the ICO wrote. The ICO expects to make a final decision by mid-2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-fined-17-million-for-breaching-uk-data-protection-laws-102806507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48a7ba87-bf2e-4de0-9f50-7ed77df3b472</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:28:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638278042</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T13:14:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/707cc690-51c7-11ec-a6f7-19319cfebad9" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/707cc690-51c7-11ec-a6f7-19319cfebad9" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ekkasit919 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iot machine learning with human and object recognition which use artificial intelligence to measurements ,analytic and identical concept, it invents to classification,estimate,prediction, database]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iot machine learning with human and object recognition which use artificial intelligence to measurements ,analytic and identical concept, it invents to classification,estimate,prediction, database]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' rolls out globally on iOS and Android]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After launching into pre-season <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile-has-launched-into-pre-season-073500710.html">earlier this month</a>, the mobile game <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em> is <a href="https://twitter.com/RLSideswipe/status/1465446286841331715">rolling out</a> to iOS and Android users around the world, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/29/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-launch/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> has reported.

According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/29/amazon-union-election-alabama-nlrb-523460"><em>Politico</em></a>, Lisa Henderson, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Region 10 Director, has ordered the e-commerce giant to hold another vote mostly due to the fact that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-retail-union-rwdsu-23-objections-election-tampering-allegation-143104913.html">installed</a> a US Postal Service mailbox in front of the warehouse to collect ballots.&nbsp;</p><p>The election results were 1,798 to 738, with workers voting against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). After those results came out, the RWDSU filed 23 objections, accusing the company of interfering with the elections. One of those complaints pointed out that Amazon installed the ballot box without approval from the NLRB and in view of security cameras that made workers feel they were under surveillance. The labor relations board <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-found-to-have-illegally-discouraged-union-organizing-in-alabama-035214235.html">sided with the union</a> and found that Amazon interfered with the election by installing the mailbox and offering employees anti-union badges and signs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Henderson wrote in the documents ordering a new election:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;By causing the Postal Service to install a cluster mailbox unit, communicating and encouraging employees to cast their ballots using the mailbox, wrapping the mailbox with its slogan, and placing the mailbox at a location where employees could reasonably believe they were being surveilled, the Employer engaged in objectionable conduct that warrants setting aside the election.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Employer’s flagrant disregard for the Board’s typical mail-ballot procedure compromised the authority of the Board and made a free and fair election impossible.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Amazon, of course, criticized the NLRB&#39;s decision. In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/29/amazon-warehouse-union-revote/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It&#39;s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b8f572b2-464b-4038-ac67-75b7559c7346</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 07:39:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638264069</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T09:21:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Voting Issues & Results]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4769e280-ff45-11eb-b7bf-e1c9fe4aa8ac" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4769e280-ff45-11eb-b7bf-e1c9fe4aa8ac" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Las Vegas - Circa June 2019: Amazon.com Fulfillment Center.

The practical result of the decision was that scooters weren’t allowed in the city. Less than two weeks later, Miami commissioners have now <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article256191517.html">voted to launch a new temporary program</a> that will allow six companies to rent out the vehicles in the city’s Edgewater, Brickell and Coconut Grove neighborhoods until January 5th, 2022.</p><p>&quot;This news comes as a relief to Miami residents who&#39;ve long relied on e-scooters as a safe, affordable and sustainable way to get around. We look forward to working closely with the commissioners and Mayor Suarez to develop a permanent program that prioritizes safety for riders and non-riders alike,” said Bruno Lopes, senior manager for government relations at Lime. “We specifically hope the city will continue to invest the millions of dollars in e-scooter fees Lime and other operators pay into protected bike lanes, the most proven way to ensure the safety of all road users.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the new program, riders will need to wear helmets when they travel on a scooter. Additionally, the city will enforce a stricter parking limit to reduce sidewalk clutter. Commissioners voted three to one in favor of implementing a new rental program after they voted four to one to scrap the previous one 11 days ago. Both votes were led by Commissioner Alex Díaz de la Portilla. The short duration of this latest pilot is due to a local city law that limits the length of temporary programs. It’s possible Miami could once again outlaw scooters while the city conducts a public bid to select three companies that will operate under a permanent program.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miami-brings-back-electric-scooter-rentals-221950291.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">12f67969-a45a-4b85-933d-7c250a634c97</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 22:19:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638270811</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:13:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4f0d2fd0-515f-11ec-be2d-f06752b1c0b0" width="3900" height="2601" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4f0d2fd0-515f-11ec-be2d-f06752b1c0b0" width="3900" height="2601" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CHANDAN KHANNA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A couple rides an electric scooter on Ocean Drive in South Beach, Miami, on June 9, 2020. - Miami-Dade County beaches that were closed due to coronavirus pandemic will open on June 10, with visitors required to follow new social distancing guidelines.

Between 10 and 12 cameras will be installed under the roof of each stadium. The system will use limb-tracking data to calculate the offside line at the moment the ball is played (i.e. the &quot;kick point&quot;). If it detects an offside offence, it will alert a replay operator, who can review the incident almost in real-time.</p><p>“The replay operator then has the opportunity to show it immediately to the VAR,” Johannes Holzmüller, FIFA&#39;s football technology and innovation director, said. “At the FIFA Arab Cup, the Assistant VAR, at a dedicated offside station, can immediately validate and confirm the information.” The VAR can then tell the match referee about the decision.</p><p>The system could catch offside fouls faster than the current VAR setup, helping games to flow more smoothly. All going well, the tech could be used at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The system has been trialed in England, Spain and Germany. There were plans to test it more broadly last year, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted those.</p><p>“Technology is very important and useful in both the pre-match preparation and the decision-making process during matches,” FIFA&#39;s chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina said. “In an offside incident, the decision is made after having analysed not only the players’ position but also, their involvement in the move. Technology – today or tomorrow – can draw a line but the assessment of an interference with play or with an opponent remains in the referee’s hands.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fifa-offside-tech-limb-tracking-test-arab-cup-200122105.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">068f1eef-4764-4265-998d-c0631dfabcac</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 20:01:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638216085</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T20:01:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ba90990-514d-11ec-aeaf-0e8e6ad9dba6" width="5121" height="3414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ba90990-514d-11ec-aeaf-0e8e6ad9dba6" width="5121" height="3414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Athena Pictures via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SWANSEA, WALES - OCTOBER 20: Assistant referee Daniel Robathan awards an off-side to West Bromwich Albion during the Sky Bet Championship match between Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion at the Swansea.com Stadium on October 20, 2021 in Swansea, Wales.

That’s a 10 percent discount off its usual $1,999 starting price. We’ve seen price reductions on the new MacBook a handful of times since launch — most notably when Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-are-already-discounted-at-amazon-143028122.html">discounted both the 14- and 16-inch variants</a> by $50 the week they came out. However, $200 off is an all-time low for a computer that only went on sale at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-event-2021-highlights-194601228.html">end of October</a></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/n1Wjyo" id="5262e7c91c4c46f78a16e049421980c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at Adorama - $1,799</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3p6KZOp" id="f45f579bf0e54ed8b995f48ce27ae6e3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at B&amp;H - $1,799</a><p>We&#39;ll note here only the Space Gray model is part of today&#39;s promotion. If you want the computer in Silver, it’s $1,999. You also can’t upgrade any of the components without paying the full price of the computer. Thankfully, the base model is plenty powerful with its 8-core M1 Pro processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the new MacBook Pros a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">score of 92</a>. Apple addressed a lot of the issues that made the previous generation so divisive. To start, unlike its predecessor, the 14-inch model comes with almost all the ports you could want. It features three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI connection, a MagSafe power port, a headphone jack and an SD card slot. Another standout feature of the 2021 MacBook Pro is its Liquid Retina XDR display. The one on the 14-inch model features a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964 and is capable of reaching 1,600 nits of brightness. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes using the computer feel smoother. The only downside of the display is that unsightly notch. But if you don’t mind it, there’s a lot to like about the 2021 MacBook Pro.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-macbook-pro-cyber-monday-deal-165803308.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">787c3ec4-d15e-4f2a-85d5-c2f23231afbd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 16:58:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638218108</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T20:35:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller drops to $50 for Cyber Monday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the Switch&#39;s Joy-Cons are perfectly suitable for casual gaming, those who want a bit more control and comfort should consider springing for the Switch Pro Controller or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html">something similar to it</a>.

He returned as CEO in 2015 when Dick Costolo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-11-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-out.html">departed</a>.</p><p>Last year, activist investment firm Elliott Management called for Dorsey to leave his position at Twitter. The firm&#39;s founder, Paul Singer, suggested Dorsey&#39;s dual CEO role meant he wasn&#39;t able to focus enough on the social media platform. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html">reached a deal</a> with Elliott Management, which included a $2 billion stock buyback, to keep Dorsey in place, despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-twitter-covid-19-olympics-jack-dorsey.html">a shaky outlook for the company</a> when the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to take hold.</p><p>Twitter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/twitter-earnings-q3-2021-1235037125/">missed</a> Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share last quarter. The main engagement metric, monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rose by 13 percent year-over-year to 211 million. However, average US mDAUs remained at 37 million for the second quarter running. In September, the company agreed to pay $809.5 million to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-settlement-class-action-suit-151202542.html">settle a class-action suit</a>, in which investors accused the company of providing misleading numbers about engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertising is still by far the biggest driver of Twitter revenue ($1.14 billion of the $1.28 billion it generated last quarter), but the company has been exploring other ways of making money over the last couple of years. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-revue-newsletter-service-124341255.html">bought newsletter service Revue</a> in January and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-revue-newsletter-subscribe-button-tweets-163814091.html">integrated it</a> into the core Twitter platform. Users can charge readers to read newsletters and Twitter takes a five percent cut.</p><p>More recently, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html">rolled out Twitter Blue</a>, a $3/month service geared toward power users that adds features such as an undo button, bookmark folders and a way to make threads more readable.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with his appointment as CEO, Agrawal has joined Twitter&#39;s board. In addition, Salesforce president and chief operating officer Bret Taylor has been named the independent chair of the board, succeeding Patrick Pichette, who remains a board member.</p><p><strong>Update 11/29 10:45AM ET: </strong>Updated with confirmation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">63a2f122-2823-4015-be88-8e04076301ec</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 15:05:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638207866</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T17:44:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Board & Management Changes]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e9a7d4d0-f347-11eb-81ef-0815aa9d257f" width="4196" height="2797" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e9a7d4d0-f347-11eb-81ef-0815aa9d257f" width="4196" height="2797" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MARCO BELLO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and co-founder & CEO of Square, attends the crypto-currency conference Bitcoin 2021 Convention at the Mana Convention Center in Miami, Florida, on June 4, 2021.

We&#39;ve seen numerous models go on sale before and during Black Friday, and now a new Cyber Monday sale has knocked iRobot devices down to new record lows. Key among them are the new poop-detecting j7 duo of robot vacuums, both of which are $200 off. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba j7" href="https://amzn.to/3FZmhWW">Roomba j7</a> has dropped to $449 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:j7+" href="https://amzn.to/3lcZDTh">j7+</a>, which comes with a clean base, is down to $649. Those prices are being matched at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Xx2obo">Best Buy</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Wellbots" href="https://fave.co/313HGzO">Wellbots</a>, too.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FZmhWW" id="f0b98bfacc0641cca7a8b8d4c13acdd8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7 at Amazon - $449</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3lcZDTh" id="6e4c40ed2de44e5db43ba9744e24d898" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $649</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rgwQ43" id="8dd8052ae65b442f89ab5282bc3312c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Roomba Cyber Monday sale at Amazon</a><p>&quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">Poop-detecting</a>&quot; might sound gimmicky, but these robot vacuums have new AI-driven computer vision technology that helps them detect obstacles as they clean so they can move around them. That means, instead of bumping into chair legs and tables, these machines will do a better job of cleaning around those permanent fixtures in your home — and they&#39;ll more easily avoid surprise hazards like pet poop. And if your new robo-vac doesn&#39;t avoid your pet&#39;s latest mess, iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if such a disaster happens within your first year of ownership.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Otherwise, the j7 devices are higher-end Roombas, so they have features like dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, which lets you control which rooms the robot cleans. The biggest difference between the j7 and the j7+ is the inclusion of the clean base on the latter. When it returns home to charge, the j7+ will automatically empty its bin into the clean base and you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months.</p><p>A number of more affordable Roombas are included in the sale, too, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3xyA18c">Roomba 694</a>, which remains on sale for $179. This is one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">our favorite budget robot vacuums</a> thanks to its good cleaning abilities and easy to use mobile app. You can also get the top-of-the-line Roomba, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:s9+" href="https://amzn.to/3xzq6zk">s9+</a>, with the Braava Jet mopping robot for over $450 off, bringing it down to $1,299.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

These devices are the first to run Wear OS with the new One UI, and thankfully those who liked Samsung&#39;s Tizen operating system will find that not much has changed here. But since it now has more Google support, you&#39;ll be able to do things like download apps directly from the Play Store and the watch has better third-party app support in general. And for those who want a wearable primarily for health tracking, you&#39;re getting the best Samsung has to offer here with a new 3-in-1 biometric sensor that enables bioelectrical impedance analysis, all-day heart rate monitoring, features like snore detection and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest difference between the Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic is the rotating bezel on the latter and its stainless steel frame, making it a better option for those who want a more classic-timepiece look in their wearable.

The Metaverse judging panel includes some high-profile folks, including fashion model Karlie Kloss along with editors from fashion sites and magazines like <em>W</em> and <em>Highsnobiety</em>.</p><p>&quot;By awarding the platform’s creators, we are recognizing the powerful global impact of digital fashion on communities around the world, its ability to create new trends in fashion, as well as the incredible opportunities it provides for talented young creators,&quot; said BFC chief executive Caroline Rush in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-british-fashion-council-is-giving-an-award-for-the-best-roblox-design-132423514.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca45f909-537d-4716-b959-1c85e5e43b54</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:24:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638192266</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T13:24:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Fashion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6587ff10-5114-11ec-bf75-cb8e06b4fb20" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6587ff10-5114-11ec-bf75-cb8e06b4fb20" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BFC/Roblox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The British Fashion Council gave an award for the best Roblox design]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The British Fashion Council gave an award for the best Roblox design]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's impressive WF-1000XM4 earbuds fall to a new all-time low of $218]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:WF-1000XM4 wireless ANC earphones" href="https://amzn.to/2ZDVPD2">WF-1000XM4 wireless ANC earphones</a> came out just this summer, so we&#39;ve only seen mild discounts so far — even during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-earbuds-speakers-audio-gear-deals-black-friday-2021-121511068.html">Black Friday</a>.

They deliver balanced sound quality across lows, mids and highs, with no heavy-handed bass or overly shrill treble. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is also improved, blocking more noise across all frequencies while using less power, to boot.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a result, battery life is up to eight hours with the ANC turned on, or 12 hours with it disabled — up about 25 percent over the previous model. Other nice features include Qi-certified wireless charging (with a quick-charge feature that gives you an hour of use in five minutes), customizable sound controls, Sony&#39;s &quot;precise voice pickup&quot; tech to improve call quality, and 360 and high-res audio support.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest downside is the comfort and fit, as Sony&#39;s foam (rather than silicone) tips might not work for all ears. That&#39;s a small complaint considering that the WF-1000XM4s top a lot of lists for the best wireless ANC earphones, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">including our own</a>. You&#39;re not likely to find them at a better price anytime soon, so if you&#39;ve been eyeing a pair, now&#39;s the time to act.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
