And there’s a lot to unpack here. Through the machinations of Q, Picard and the crew of the La Sirena find themselves in 2024. Setting season two of the series in the near future may seem like lazy writing, but if you’ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ds9-kingdom-solar-opposites-170043593.html"><em><ins>Deep Space Nine</ins></em></a>, you know that’s an important year in Star Trek’s in-universe history that the franchise has explored in the past.</p><div id="44dc030a529c472888f40823f182e5f4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to the road not taken.&nbsp;💫&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekPicard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarTrekPicard</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarTrek</a><a href="https://t.co/bpxokj5q5H">https://t.co/bpxokj5q5H</a><a href="https://t.co/lOquhyR2PC">pic.twitter.com/lOquhyR2PC</a></p>— Star Trek (@StarTrek) <a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrek/status/1484586779919405062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>In “Past Tense,” a two-episode arc from season three of <em>DS9</em>, a transporter anomaly (what else?) sends Commander Sisko, Dr. Bashir and Jadzia Dax to San Francisco circa the early 21st century. After the police leave him and Bashir in the city’s “Sanctuary District,” a ghetto that houses San Francisco’s poor and sick away from its more well-off citizens, Sisko realizes they’ve arrived on Earth days before the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bell_Riots"><ins>Bell Riots</ins></a>, a moment that’s pivotal to Star Trek’s worldbuilding. And it’s likely that moment Picard references at the start of the trailer. “There are some moments that haunt us all our lives,” he says. “Moments upon which history turns.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two episodes that make up “Past Tense” are widely considered some of the best the franchise has to offer, in large part because they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/star-trek-deep-space-nine-past-tense/542280/"><ins>directly address economic and racial injustice in American society</ins></a>. It’s hard to say if <em>Picard</em> will have something meaningful to add to that conversation, but it’s clear that’s part of the intent here. At the very least, fans can look forward to a cameo from Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan.</p><p>In the US, season two of <em>Star Trek: Picard </em>will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-live-channels-star-trek-survivor-spongebob-squarepants-163257829.html">Paramount+</a> on March 3rd.

They said the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-jedi-blue-ad-deal-165604926.html"><ins>agreed a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; in 2018</ins></a> that gave Facebook parent Meta a boost in ad header bidding (a type of tech allows publishers to solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges simultaneously) in exchange for support for Google&#39;s Open Bidding method of selling ads.</p><p>Google said the deal was above board and that it wasn&#39;t a secret, as Facebook Audience Network (FAN) was <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/latest-admob-updates-making-more-money-mobile-app-ads/?fbclid=IwAR3dY0kup3tTR1O_1dAHDaKecUUS-aduWQb_W_MNF-7VZVV3n0E55Ryaovc">one of several partners</a> for its Open Bidding program. Cohen said the deal &quot;does not provide FAN with an advantage in the Open Bidding auction. FAN competes in the auction just like other bidders: FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression, period. If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction.&quot;</p><p>The AGs also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-suit-amended-chrome-privacy-sandbox-texas-193709103.html"><ins>alleged</ins></a> that Google harnessed at least three programs to manipulate ad auctions. The aim, according to the states, was to push publishers and advertisers into using the company&#39;s own tools.</p><p>&quot;State Plaintiffs respond to Google’s success by seeking to compel Google to share with its competitors the fruits of its investments and innovation,&quot; Google wrote in its filing. &quot;They criticize Google for not designing its products to better suit its rivals’ needs and for making improvements to those products that leave its competitors too far behind. They see the &#39;solution&#39; to Google’s success as holding Google back, rather than letting market forces urge its competitors forward.&quot;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-asks-judge-dismiss-most-texas-antitrust-lawsuit-2022-01-21/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> notes, the two other charges in the suit are based on state law and were stayed in September. Although Google hasn&#39;t asked for those to be dismissed, it reserved the right to make that request at a later date.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-motion-to-dismiss-charges-194011413.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bc23b76-2af0-469e-ac7d-a5929cc5dffc</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 19:40:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642795119</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T19:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is seen at the entrance to the Google retail store in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

In case you haven’t kept up with the MonsterVerse, Monarch has made an appearance in a number of recent Godzilla and King Kong movies dating back to 2014’s <em>Godzilla, </em>with Monarch typically serving as the multi-national organization overseeing the research and tracking of MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While neither Apple nor Legendary has yet to provide a cast list or release date for its upcoming Godzilla series, the show will be helmed by showrunner Chris Black (Outcast, Star Trek: Enterprise) and Matt Fraction, who is best known for his writing on the 2012 run of Marvel’s <em>Hawkeye</em> comics. However, the big deal for kaiju-lovers is that the upcoming Godzilla show on Apple TV+ will be the first live-action series set in the MonsterVerse, and only the second TV show following the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tomb-raider-netflix-anime-skull-island-164800086.html"><ins>Skull Island anime on Netflix.</ins></a></p><p>Currently, it’s unclear how the new Apple TV+ series will tie into existing MonsterVerse movies – particularly last year’s <em>Godzilla vs. Kong </em>which saw the big green dino team up with King Kong to battle a range of foes both ancient and modern.

It was envisioned as a reboot of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-windows-phone-support-ends.html">Windows Phone</a> with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-microsoft-andromeda-courier-digital-notebook.html"><ins>emphasis on inking</ins></a>. The company worked on the software until it eventually decided to instead include Android on the Surface Duo. Until now, we’ve only seen glimpses of Andromeda in things like patent filing. But <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"><em>Windows Central</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>recently<em>&nbsp;</em>obtained an internal build of the operating system and installed it on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-27-microsoft-lumia-950-review.html"><ins>Lumia 950</ins></a>.</p><div id="c5a8f57d92f343c987c22d6e3e3c7a07"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmfsHI_NSwc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of a rare look at an unfinished project, what’s interesting about seeing Andromeda after all these years is how many of the ideas Microsoft was working on then either made their way to the Surface Duo or apps the company has released since. On the lock screen, for instance, you can see an early version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-surface-duo-peek-notification-feature.html"><ins>Surface Duo’s peek functionality</ins></a>. Meanwhile, a lot of the features you see on the “Journal” home screen eventually made their way to the company’s Whiteboard app, and that’s something you can download from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-microsoft-collaborative-whiteboard-app-available.html"><ins>Microsoft Store</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, it’s an interesting look at what could have been. Even in the software’s unfinished state, there’s a lot we see in the video that’s genuinely different from anything Android and iOS offer, even to this day. The fact Andromeda allowed you to jot down notes directly on the lock screen, and that they would still be there the next time you unlocked the phone, is something that looks genuinely useful.</p><p>Of course, there are probably many good reasons Microsoft ultimately decided not to pursue Andromeda. Launching a device that does something different, let alone a completely new operating system, is no easy task in a mature marketplace. Unless a device does nearly everything right, it’s difficult to overcome the fact most people tend to stick with products they know and are comfortable with.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-andromeda-hands-on-video-172643314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45ed018f-922e-4637-8bb5-b575dd11ddf0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 17:26:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642786006</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T17:26:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page.

While the drive supports optional password protection, the kicker here is its built-in fingerprint reader that you can use as an extra layer of security.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The T7 Touch&#39;s compact design helps it fit into nearly any bag you may be carrying, plus its shock- and drop-resistant aluminum unibody should protect it from too much damage if it accidentally takes a tumble. We also appreciate that it comes with both USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables, allowing you to use the drive with most laptops, smartphones, tablets and even some game consoles.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-1tb-t7-touch-ssd-is-50-off-at-amazon-140553582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">430cf028-fc84-45a3-b166-93e908456d78</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:05:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642773251</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T13:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/1bff8b90-2e6c-11eb-bfff-f249396637e5" width="1280" height="812" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/1bff8b90-2e6c-11eb-bfff-f249396637e5" width="1280" height="812" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[German Bionic's connected exoskeleton helps workers lift smarter]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re still quite a ways away from wielding proper <a href="https://youtu.be/FSrcMaid0mg?t=8">Power Loaders</a> but advances in exosuit technology are rapidly changing how people perform physical tasks in their daily lives — some designed to help rehabilitate spinal injury patients, others created to <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/07/28/marines-test-exoskeleton-suit-can-do-work-of-10-troops.html">improve a Marine’s warfighting capabilities</a>, and many built simply to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-23-lg-robotic-exoskeleton-cloi-suitbot.html">make physically repetitive vocations less stressful</a> for the people performing them. But <a href="https://www.germanbionic.com/en/">German Bionic</a> claims only one of them is intelligent enough to learn from its users’ mistaken movements: its 5th-generation Cray X.</p><p>The Cray X fits on workers like a 7kg backpack with hip-mounted actuators that move carbon fiber linkages strapped to the upper legs, allowing a person to easily lift and walk with up to 30kg (66 lbs) with both their legs and backs fully supported. Though it doesn’t actively assist the person’s shoulders and arms with the task, the Cray X does offer a Smart Safety Companion system to help mitigate common lifting injuries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“It&#39;s a real time software application that runs in the background and can warn the worker when the ergonomic risk is getting too high,” Norma Steller, German Bionic’s Head of IoT, told Engadget. “For example, recommending a break because we know that… the repetition and the overall stress can lead to fatigue, and fatigue can lead to injuries. This is something we want to prevent.”</p><p>The SSC not only collects granular telemetry information — what load is being lifted, ergonomic risks such as twisting while lifting, and potential environmental factors — it uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze that data to adapt the exoskeleton to the worker wearing it via OTA software updates. Not only is this data displayed to the workers themselves on an attached monitor, the Cray X also transmits that data up the supervisory chain allowing managers to monitor the movements of their employees to ensure that they are not overexerting themselves.</p><p>“Since we are collecting every single step and every single lift, the data that we provide is much more accurate,” Steller noted. The data the Cray collects is gathered from real-world use, not lab tests or supervised trials where workers are on their best ergonomic behavior. “Especially in logistics, every single step, every single lift, every single trend is usually planned. But sometimes in the real world, not every plan comes to fulfillment and then we suddenly see workplace performance drop very, very quickly. And with the data we provide, you can actually do an investigation and figure out why [that drop off is occurring].”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9b5848c0-7ae0-11ec-b4d7-376290a4e463" style="height:4002;width:6000;" alt="The Cray X 5th Generation exoskeleton" data-uuid="931dfd1c-596c-392f-97a8-0bf6b89384d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">German Bionic</div></figure><p>Steller sees the Cray X as a &quot;preventative device&quot; designed to ensure workers don&#39;t overextend or overexert themselves. “We are a preventative device, so we are preventing injury,” Steller added. “We&#39;re not considered a medical [device manufacturer]. We consider ourselves an exoskeleton for industrial use.” As such, the Cray X is <a href="https://www.coolstuffshub.com/ip-rating-guide/#:~:text=A%20product%20with%20an%20IP54,of%20water%20from%20any%20angle.">IP54 rated</a> for dust and moisture so it can work in all but the dingiest of warehouse environments.</p><p>And though the Cray X is designed to be put on and taken off in under a minute, it can be worn for up to a full work shift without being removed thanks to the 5th generation’s new hot-swappable 40V battery system.</p><p>“We implemented the hot swapping function so that you can just drop it on the spot without having to turn off the device,” Marius Kiss, Head of Mechanical R&amp;D at German Bionic, told Engadget. “You can pull out the [spent battery] for a new one, place the old one on the charger — we use the Makita fast charging stations which charge the battery in like 30 to 40 minutes — and then you can just move on. You could potentially work like eight hours without having to take off the exoskeleton.”</p><p>For as useful as the current generation of exoskeletal technologies are today, the German Bionic team sees them becoming even more capable, and widespread, in the years ahead. “My feeling is that we will see much more specialized exoskeletons in the future because the technology is more available.” Steller said. “I think they will enter our world, not only in the B2B industrial sectors. We will see them basically everywhere because we have the chance to augment our body and usually humans take the chance to do that. We will see them everywhere, without any real limitation but very specialized to the use case.”</p><p>“I really see everyone on the street wearing an exoskeleton in one form or another,” Eric Eitel, German Bionic’s Head of Communications, added. “But I think that the exoskeletons that we are looking for in the future are the active ones. I see them being a lot slimmer, smarter and connected.”</p><p>And even as the technology expands to consumer uses, Eitel believes exoskeletons will likely remain a common sight in industrial settings. “There are still a lot of workspaces that cannot be automated and I think that&#39;s going to stay like that for a long time. You still have to rely on people so we don&#39;t want to replace all the humans. I really see that technology is going alongside [automation].”</p><p>“We see robots more as companions, our product is actually a companion,” added Kiss. “I think this can be just another possibility, I mean, there&#39;s still situations where automation still makes a lot of sense. When you go into dangerous environments, you should actually automate that. But why should we automate everything?”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/german-bionic-cray-x-5th-gen-exoskeleton-connectivity-future-of-robotics-140023476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b1979b0-3bc3-42d8-82fd-9513a47092e1</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642786676</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T17:38:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/86a61110-78a5-11ec-bce7-f81f2b37db8d" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/86a61110-78a5-11ec-bce7-f81f2b37db8d" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[German Bionic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[German Bionic's Cray X exoskeleton]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[German Bionic's Cray X exoskeleton]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: James Webb’s eye in the stars, Microsoft buys Activision]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that the James Webb Space Telescope is safely on the way to its orbital home, Cherlynn and Devindra chat about why it’s so important with <a href="https://www.space.com/"><ins>Space.com</ins></a> editor-in-chief Tariq Malik, as well as science and technology journalist <a href="https://www.swapnakrishna.com/"><ins>Swapna Krishna</ins></a>.

It wasn&#39;t exactly due to the content of their videos, however, but because some of the group&#39;s members were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oath-keepers-leader-charged-capitol-breach-211007516.html">charged</a> with seditious conspiracy over their role in the January 6th, 2021 US Capitol breach. One of the deactivated channels was named &quot;Oath Keepers&quot; and had fewer than 45,000 subscribers, while the other belonged to group leader Stewart Rhodes and had fewer than 20 subscribers. Rhodes (pictured above) was arrested for his role in the attack and was one of the members who were charged.</p><p>YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi told <em>Axios</em> that the channels broke the platform&#39;s creator responsibility guidelines. According to those guidelines, YouTube may terminate a channel if there&#39;s &quot;significant evidence presented in a court of law against a creator for a very egregious crime&quot; and that channel&#39;s &quot;YouTube comment is closely related to the crime.&quot; YouTube said that the termination &quot;follows evidence presented in federal indictments against the Oath Keepers and the charges against them and their role in the Jan. 6 attacks.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Justice Department, the Oath Keepers discussed their plans to seize the Capitol building using encrypted messaging apps and social networks. The group has long used online platforms to disseminate information, including COVID-19 conspiracy theories with QAnon hashtags and threats of violence. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-the-oath-keepers-211426663.html">banned</a> the group back in 2020 for violating its policies on violent extremist groups. In addition to removing two channels, YouTube will no longer allow the Oath Keepers to create, use or own any other channel. Further, it will remove re-uploads of its old videos and will even delete new channels that try to reuse content from the deleted accounts.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-deactivates-oath-keepers-channels-130509458.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3db3a7e-8cc7-41cc-b25e-34f3084adbd7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 13:05:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642769058</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T12:44:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/914857a0-757a-11ec-b77d-d2154bde45d4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/914857a0-757a-11ec-b77d-d2154bde45d4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[FORT WORTH, TX - FEBRUARY 28: Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, told The Washington Post via Getty Images, February 28, 2021 in Fort Worth, Texas, that the government is trying to inflate the rogue actions of a few members into an alleged conspiracy committed by the organization on Jan. 6, 2021.

The doctors have transplanted kidneys from a genetically altered pig into the abdomen of a brain-dead man, and as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/health/transplants-pig-human-kidney.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported, the procedure was described in a paper published in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16930">American Journal of Transplantation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the doctors, the kidneys from the pig started producing urine as soon as 23 minutes after the procedure and continued to do so for three days. The patient&#39;s kidneys were fully removed, and his body didn&#39;t show signs of rejecting the transplanted organs. This is the latest in a series of developments wherein  organs from genetically altered pigs were successfully transplanted into humans. In late 2021, NYU Langone Health doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/kidney-transplant-pig-human.html">attached</a> a pig kidney onto the blood vessels of a brain-dead patient&#39;s upper leg. And, just a few days ago, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html">transplanted</a> a pig&#39;s heart into a live patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UAB surgeons performed the procedure with consent from the family of the recipient, James Parsons, who wanted to be an organ donor. They&#39;re now naming this type of study after him. While the recipient was brain dead in this case, it&#39;s a big step toward a clinical trial involving live patients that they&#39;re hoping would start later this year. Dr. Jayme Locke, the team&#39;s lead surgeon, said this wasn&#39;t a one-off experiment, and that the hope is to &quot;advance the field to help... patients.&quot; The doctor who serves as director to UAB&#39;s Incompatible Kidney Transplant Program added: &quot;What a wonderful day it will be when I can walk into clinic and know I have a kidney for everyone waiting to see me.&quot;</p><p>Based on data from the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network</a>, there are currently 90,272 people on the waiting list for kidney transplant. In addition, around 3,000 new patients are <a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/Organ-Donation-and-Transplantation-Stats#:~:text=The%20median%20wait%20time%20for,compatibility%20and%20availability%20of%20organs.&amp;text=In%202014%2C%2017%2C107%20kidney%20transplants,5%2C537%20came%20from%20living%20donors.">added</a> to the waiting list for the organ each month. Dr. Locke said &quot;kidney failure is refractory, severe and impactful&quot; and that &quot;it needs a radical solution.&quot; She hopes to be able to offer life-saving pig kidney transplants to patients within the next five years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/implant-genetically-altered-pig-kidneys-brain-dead-patient-120509525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8babcf45-7044-422e-b242-1113ccbeca40</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 12:05:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642776028</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T14:41:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tests & Procedures]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cd509130-7aa3-11ec-bf3f-6a6f1ae49f84" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cd509130-7aa3-11ec-bf3f-6a6f1ae49f84" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[South_agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Group of surgeons performing surgery on a patient in operating room.

Intel&#39;s initial plans include building two semiconductor fabrication plants (or fabs) on the property that would employ 3,000 people. Construction on the site is scheduled to begin this year, and Intel expects the fabs to be operational by 2025.</p><p>A <em>Bloomberg</em> report back in late 2021 claimed that the White House &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html">strongly discouraged</a>&quot; Intel from ramping up chip production in China. The administration has been pushing for companies to manufacture chips in the US in order to address the ongoing global shortage. In turn, companies have been lobbying the president to fund semiconductor research and manufacturing. It&#39;s worth noting, though, that since building new plants takes years, projects like this won&#39;t be able to help address supply chain shortages anytime soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel said it looked at 38 different sites in the US for the facility but ultimately chose Ohio, because of all the space it could use. The company doesn&#39;t want to build in places where it could displace residents, since that&#39;s what ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-14-amazon-cancels-new-york-hq2.html">killed</a> Amazon&#39;s plans to build a second headquarters in NYC. When the fabs are done, Intel will use them to manufacture both its own chips and chips for clients under the Intel Foundry Services. The company announced its foundry services when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">revealed</a> that it&#39;s building two factories in Arizona, which will also cost Intel $20 billion, back in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Gelsinger, the chipmaker has the option to expand the Ohio site to 2,000 acres and to build as many as eight fabs in the future. &quot;We helped to establish the Silicon Valley,&quot; the CEO told <em>Time</em>. &quot;Now we’re going to do the Silicon Heartland.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 01/21/22 3:45PM ET:</strong> Intel has officially published a press release confirming that it&#39;s building a new &quot;mega-site&quot; in Ohio. The whole project, if the company decides to expand its initial plans and build more fabs, could be worth up to $100 billion over the next decade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ichip-making-facility-in-ohio-073608482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0497dfc8-b03c-4ed1-b0a8-94f5f2578de4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 07:36:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642760666</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T10:24:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will now reduce the visibility of 'potentially harmful' content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is taking new steps to make <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-we-address-harmful-content-on-feed"><ins>“potentially harmful”</ins></a> content less visible in its app. The company says that the algorithm powering the way posts are ordered in users’ feeds and in Stories will now de-prioritize content that “may contain bullying, hate speech or may incite violence.”</p><p>While Instagram’s rules already prohibit much of this type of content, the change could affect borderline posts, or content that hasn’t yet reached the app’s moderators. “To understand if something may break our rules, we&#39;ll look at things like if a caption is similar to a caption that previously broke our rules,” the company explains in an update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Up until now, Instagram has tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-reveal-content-recommendation-guidelines-130011327.html"><ins>to hide</ins></a> potentially objectionable content from public-facing parts of the app, like Explore, but hasn’t changed how it appears to users who follow the accounts posting this type of content.

Specifically, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lioness-2-ai-orgasm-vibrator-data-collection-ces-2020.html">Lioness smart vibrator</a>, which gathers bio-data like body temperature and pelvic pressure. Liemhetcharat said she was partly inspired by the <a href="https://perifit.co/">Perifit</a> kegel exerciser, which also uses games and a device to help people strengthen their pelvic floor. The game, an endless runner called <em>You Are What You Eat</em>, has been in beta since then. Today, Liemhetcharat has released the Android version, which you can now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AtasFun.YouAreWhatYouEatLioness">download from the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Liemhetcharat told Engadget that <em>You Are What You Eat</em> is based on her family&#39;s favorite activity. &quot;Our running joke is that we eat everything,&quot; she said. By itself, the game is an endless runner, with the objective of eating as many creatures as possible before dying. You begin as a blob, then grow and morph depending on what you ingest. That will also affect what you can continue to consume, as some creatures will subsequently become &quot;inedible&quot; based on what you&#39;ve become. A <a href="https://allisonliem.org/youarewhatyoueat/lioness_1d28/">WebGL version of the game</a> is available.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8da3b4d368e64ed1beffa37dbc2ebf8c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTmYVeCyw2I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>But for those who own the Lioness smart vibrator, you can use it to control your slimeball. Squeeze the dildo&#39;s head (where the pressure sensors are) to jump, and do that twice to fly or jump twice. The device will also vibrate in response when you do those things or eat something.</p><p>Those on iOS won&#39;t be left out — Liemhetcharat told Engadget that a version for the iPhone is coming soon, too. So far, the game itself is simple, but the most intriguing aspect is its use of the bio-sensing vibrator as a controller. As a proof of concept, <em>YAWYE</em> is fairly straightforward, though we&#39;ll have to wait for medical professionals to weigh in before we can say with any certainty if it can be helpful in strengthening pelvic floor muscles.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/you-are-what-you-eat-lioness-smart-vibrator-game-223046404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83c794f4-5357-4d65-abf7-ba42ffb6e19b</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 22:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642718875</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T07:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allison Liemhetcharat]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from the game "You Are What You Eat" featuring some trees, two pink creatures on the bottom left and the words "This creature has ears, so you will grow ears when you eat it" at the top.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[You Are What You Eat game screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's Swift Observatory may have suffered an attitude control failure]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-fast-radio-burst-in-milky-way-002145743.html">Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</a> has run into difficulties after 17 years of largely smooth service.

They not only have to measure their blood glucose levels and inject the right amount of insulin, but carry all the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-apple-diabetes-products-in-stores.html">relevant equipment</a> with them. MIT and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital researchers might soon eliminate many of the headaches, though. They&#39;re <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/all-one-diabetes-insulin-0120">developing</a> all-in-one devices (not pictured) that measure glucose, calculate the necessary insulin dose and inject you accordingly.</p><p>The first device includes the blood-drawing lancet, glucose test strips and an insulin needle. Users would first take a photo of their meal using a smartphone app to estimate the food volume and carbohydrate levels. After that, they&#39;d start the automated process of collecting blood, calculating glucose (again through the app) and delivering the appropriate amount of insulin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second gadget would only need one needle jab — it would build the glucose sensor into the insulin needle and inject the appropriate amount of insulin. You&#39;d have to wait five to ten seconds, but you wouldn&#39;t have to stick yourself twice.</p><p>The technology is still some ways off. While the first device would use parts that were already FDA-approved, it hasn&#39;t been tested in humans. The second, meanwhile, uses a new sensor type that will likely require more work to be testable with humans. Scientists have filed patents for both devices and are hoping to work with companies on further development.</p><p>There&#39;s a strong motivation to bring these devices to market, at least. People with diabetes would only need to use one device at meals, and with the hybrid sensor/needle might suffer less pain. That, in turn, could encourage consistent treatment that improves your overall wellbeing.</p><div id="0ec4baba0b224944b492478db00574c7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMSgdLa4aYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-diabetes-device-blood-glucose-insulin-injection-205524756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1005f400-8d26-4493-85cc-2f2beb0eae69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:55:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642716081</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T07:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diabetes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JGalione via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app. Tottori, Japan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
