The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-accused-in-suit-of-installing-data-back-door-in-pakistan-project-11628947988">reports</a> that American contractor Business Efficiency Solutions (BES) has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Huawei of not only stealing technology, but pressuring the firm into installing a data backdoor for a law enforcement safer-cities project in Lahore, Pakistan. The system supposedly gave Huawei access to a database that helped it collect sensitive citizen and government data &quot;important to Pakistan&#39;s national security.&quot;</p><p>BES alleged that Huawei insisted on creating a duplicate version of the Lahore network in Suzhou, China, that would provide direct access to the Pakistan data. While BES wanted permission from Pakistani officials before going forward, Huawei reportedly claimed it didn&#39;t need permission and initially threatened to cut off the deal if BES didn&#39;t move forward. The Chinese company later said it obtained permission, but apparently refused to provide evidence of this when asked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation may not be clear-cut. Huawei told the <em>WSJ</em> there was &quot;no evidence&quot; it had installed backdoors in any products. In a statement from earlier in the dispute, the company acknowledged the duplicate system in China but maintained that it was strictly a test version &quot;physically isolated&quot; from the real network, making it impossible to extract data. An overseer for the Lahore effort, Muhammad Kamran Khan, said an investigation was underway but that there wasn&#39;t any evidence of data theft &quot;so far.&quot;</p><p>Whoever is telling the truth, the lawsuit highlights the ongoing concerns that Huawei might be aiding China&#39;s surveillance goals. The company has long denied the allegations, and there isn&#39;t yet &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence that it has used backdoors to snoop on other countries. However, that hasn&#39;t allayed suspicions that have led the US, UK and others to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-files-us-lawsuit-disputing-fcc-security-threat-designation-172919533.html">blacklist its technology</a>. This case might only exacerbate Huawei&#39;s situation, even if BES&#39; assertions don&#39;t hold up in court.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d76098-7882-451e-99e1-37052c42347a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 19:43:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629056591</ingested><modified>2021-08-15T19:43:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wolfgang Rattay / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies is pictured next to a statue on top of a building in Copenhagen, Denmark, June 23, 2021.

Intelligence officer and initiative leader John Cohen told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-considers-outside-firms-to-analyze-social-media-after-jan-6-failure-11629025200?mod=rss_Technology">interview</a> that Homeland Security is looking at hiring companies to analyze social networks for signs of impending terrorism and other extremist violence. The department had been studying social media before, but the outside partners would help &quot;dramatically&quot; expand these efforts, Cohen said.</p><p>Murmurs of extensive social media scanning first surfaced in May, but there were few details about how it would work. The rumors suggested Homeland Security would focus on alarming trends rather than individual targets, such as brewing extremist movements or threats against specific communities. The aim is to catch the violent rhetoric behind events like the January 6th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-stop-the-steal-ahead-of-inaguration-214239970.html">Capitol riot</a>, which Homeland Security didn&#39;t anticipate despite mounting social media activity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the companies involved in discussions is Logically, a firm that uses a mix of AI and human analysis to track online content at a large scale.

Cohen said the department wouldn&#39;t use companies to acquire information it was restricted from seeing, and <em>WSJ</em> sources said officials were determined to protect civil liberties. Logically chief Lyric Jain said his company couldn&#39;t share personal data for Americans without court orders.</p><p>Even so, there are concerns Homeland Security could abuse this private analysis. It could theoretically hold on to content and use the data to pursue unrelated criminal cases or target peaceful political dissent. That could chill free speech by making people afraid to talk about certain subjects in public channels, even if there are no discussions of violent intentions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/homeland-security-social-media-search-plans-152947703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be4d31e9-501c-44b1-9e0a-db0ae62f35d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 15:29:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629041388</ingested><modified>2021-08-15T15:30:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - MARCH 7: The Department of Homeland Security logo is seen on a law enforcement vehicle in Washington, United States on March 7, 2017.

An anonymous WarnerMedia executive <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/hbo-max-app-crash-problem-fix.html">talking</a> to <em>Vulture</em> claims the HBO Max team will replace all its smart TV apps with brand new versions inside of the &quot;next four or five months.&quot; Roku and PlayStation owners would receive the overhauled apps first, followed by Apple TV users near the end of 2021. Mobile and web viewers would have to wait until early 2022.</p><p>The existing apps have suffered from a number of serious flaws, ranging from broken playback controls to forgotten settings and sluggishness. Roku users have faced more problems than most, with lockups and crashes sometimes making the HBO Max app unusable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The problems reportedly stem from WarnerMedia&#39;s scramble to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-availability-movies-shows-140049904.html">launch HBO Max in May</a>.

It was built to handle high demand, but it wasn&#39;t meant to cope with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">increasingly global</a> audience streaming much more than <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>An HBO Max app revamp will supposedly provide both modern underpinnings and, importantly, room to grow. The unnamed executive said the new app won&#39;t look much different at first, but should allow for a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; interface update as well as new and upgraded features.</p><p>If accurate, this could be important to HBO Max&#39;s long-term future. The TV streaming space is increasingly crowded with rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">Peacock</a> joining incumbents like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

This week, Billy Steele lent his ears to Samsung’s new entry level Galaxy Buds 2 to check out their new design and features. A little while ago, Terrence O’Brien created beautiful music on the Novation Circuit Rhythm sampler and struggled with the controls on the SkulptSynth SE. Devindra Hardawar also experienced immersive VR courtesy of two professional headsets from HTC. Lastly, Daniel Cooper checked out Framework’s repairable laptop to see just how easy it is to customize and fix.</p><h2>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">offer premium features at an affordable price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew" data-uuid="d85d267f-eaf1-3d9f-8f6e-219ac49d7b5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Affordable wireless earbuds often come with compromises, but Billy Steele feels that Samsung has found a winning combination with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3iGTSwg">Galaxy Buds 2</a>. Redesigned to include wireless charging and ambient sound at an entry-level price of $150, the Galaxy Buds 2 are 15 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the Galaxy Buds+, which makes them comfortable to wear. Billy says that the sound quality, though improved, doesn’t have quite the same clarity and depth, but the dynamic range is comparable. Low-end tones lack punch and tracks that should sound big and bombastic are a bit flat and subdued.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That being said, he was still impressed by the inclusion of active noise-cancellation, which Samsung says can reduce 98 percent of background noise. Billy could still hear a bit of his box fans and white noise machine during testing, but the feature was definitely better than relying solely on passive isolation. He felt that Samsung delivered on the call quality improvements as well, via a combination of machine learning, three microphones per bud and a voice-pickup unit to maximize clarity. He managed to get around seven hours of battery life from “regular” use (which included some ANC), but was disappointed that the Buds 2 only have an IPX2 rating, which could produce issues during sweaty workout.</p><h2>HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2 produces an incredible virtual reality experience — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html">but it comes at a steep price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="6ae80b9d-4f42-3655-b669-12c7a13e7b8a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar liked <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://fave.co/3zhTpWI">HTC’s Vive Pro 2</a> VR headset so much he called it “an enthusiast’s dream.” However, he’s quick to point out that its $1,399 price tag makes it a tough sell. The Vive Pro 2 offers a 5K 120Hz display with 2,448 x 2,448 pixels per eye. Additionally, the LCDs have RGB sub-pixels that help to produce the sharpest desktop VR experience that he’s ever seen. It also has solid ergonomics — Devindra says the headset is comfortable to wear for extended sessions due to its weight distribution and its plush cushioning on the front and back.</p><p>But even if you’re prepared to shell out for the headset, Devindra admits it comes with some drawbacks. First, the controllers are the same archaic, oversized ones that came with the original 2016 Vive. He also felt that the on-ear headphones produced some heat during use, as did the displays. But the biggest issue is the graphics power necessary to experience the device in its full glory: Devindra says you can probably forget about getting anything truly usable out of the system’s minimum requirements, which means you’ll need a lot of desktop power to get the most out of the Vive Pro 2. Despite those hurdles, he’s quick to call the Vive Pro 2 the highest quality desktop VR available right now.</p><h2>Framework’s modular laptop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html">can be repaired by anyone</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" alt="Framework Laptop Hero Image" data-uuid="d5a7ef23-e2fe-38d2-bd6b-eb1e66dce77a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p><a href="https://frame.work/">Framework’s laptop</a> isn’t eye-catching or showy.

While testing how easy it was to replace a keyboard, Daniel Cooper said he felt fully confident that he could make multiple repairs to the machine — something that can’t be said for most consumer laptops.</p><p>In addition to being easy to upgrade and fix, the Framework features a solid spec list: a 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display with a backlight capable of 400 nits; a variety of inputs via the expansion cards as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack; a chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and an impressive 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view.

The only thing Daniel didn’t enjoy about the machine were the side-firing speakers, which produced weak, tinny sound.</p><h2>The HTC Vive Focus 3 is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">premium VR workhorse</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="f4f40b8c-822e-3409-9a78-d0ee1770933d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Much like the Vive Pro 2, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">HTC’s Vive Focus 3</a> isn’t intended for the casual consumer. The $1,300 price point alone puts it on another level, likely best for business users who should be pleased with the superior hardware, ergonomics and build quality. Devindra Hardawar says the system has just about everything you would want in a modern headset: a sturdy yet light build with a design that’s comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and even has support for large glasses.</p><p>With a 5K resolution, a 90Hz refresh rate and a 120-degree field of view, the Vive Pro 2 delivered one of the most immersive standalone VR experiences that Devindra has seen. He had a realistic sense of walking through meadows and beaches in a nature trek VR program, and said he was consistently impressed by how great everything looked. However, he was disappointed by the limited software library that required him to remove the headset to purchase apps and games. After his time with the Focus 3, Devindra heartily felt that it is an ideal set up for companies who can take advantage of the business-focused apps and the hardware quality without cringing at the price point.</p><h2>The SkulptSynth SE is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html">a formidable sound engine</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>As a follow up to the original Skulpt, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SkulptSynth SE" href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">SkulptSynth SE</a> makes some upgrades to the build quality but comes in more affordable at $199. Terrence O’Brien spent some time with the instrument and determined that it’s still as powerful, compelling and confusing as the previous version. The SE features a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices which produces a thick tone that Terrence called inviting. He says the SE shines when the stacked oscillators are given a chance to really flesh out the sound. He also approved of the various modulation options, which give the device a surprising amount of depth.</p><p>Despite the improvements in the hardware (specifically firmer knobs), Terrence said that the SE still felt pretty wobbly and cheap overall. And he was still frustrated by the cramped layout and the navigation of the controls — he recommends keeping the included cheat sheet at hand to help with the latter. Additionally, the touch keyboard wasn’t always super responsive. However, using the app solved a lot of his complaints and he was excited about the MPE support, which is unheard of at the SE’s price point.</p><h2>Intel’s NUC 11 Extreme <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-11-extreme-review-practical-tiny-gaming-desktop-pc-130041721.html">offers gamers a full sized GPU</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="d3aa09bc-49ae-3c93-bf3b-44ecdd6faba6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar is quick to acknowledge that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:NUC 11 Extreme" href="https://fave.co/2VLRlZa">NUC 11 Extreme</a>, aka “Beast Canyon,” is pretty sizable. However, he feels the trade-off is worth it because the design provides support for a full GPU — something that should attract gamers to the unit. It’s also a bit cheaper than the last model and more flexible due to the fast 11th-gen Intel CPU (which can be purchased separately as an upgrade for NUC 9 Extreme owners).</p><p>This NUC was clearly designed with gamers in mind with an LED skull on the black metal case, mesh air vents and three large fans on top. Devindra was pleased to report that the case cooling on the device was excellent: the GPU never went above 75 celsius and the CPU stayed under 80 celsius. Additionally, because of the thoughtful modular design, he had no trouble fitting in large GPUs like NVIDIA’s RTX 3070 Ti or the Radeon RX 6800. The system also performed well in benchmark testing: in PCMark 10 it outpaced every Windows PC we’ve seen this year. Still, the $1,150 to $1,350 price tag for the NUC 11 is high, especially because owners will need to pay up for additional hardware and software.</p><h2>The Novation Circuit Rhythm is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-review-a-solid-and-affordable-sampler-groovebox-130026004.html">entirely sample-based</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ecbdb1-eb32-11eb-ad6f-51f9f1a6a517" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="8bdda6e8-edaf-314f-9add-82d6eb07d1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though physically similar to its cousin the Circuit Tracks, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Novation&#x002019;s Circuit Rhythm" href="https://fave.co/3sdLDLf">Novation’s Circuit Rhythm</a> uses the popular screen-free workflow of the Circuit with the full-featured sampler and performance effects of the SP-303 to produce a device that is ideal for lo-fi hip hop and house music.

Tap the button and you&#39;ll see a swipeable video collection from both the subreddits you&#39;ve subscribed to as well as related communities. As usual, you can upvote, downvote, comment on or gift awards.</p><p>A basic version of this experience was available before, but only if you tapped on a video — and the first videos you&#39;d see would come from the same subreddit.

Reddit started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-reddit-livestreaming-trial-rpan.html">toying with livestreams</a> in 2019, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bought-tik-tok-rival-dubsmash-113916703.html">bought TikTok rival Dubsmash</a> in December 2020. While that company&#39;s code isn&#39;t being used for the feed (that will come with future products), the acquisition signalled Reddit&#39;s intent — it wants to keep its social network relevant in an era when video is all-important. You might not see video take center stage, but it&#39;s now considerably more than a nice-to-have feature.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-tiktok-video-feed-154754721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">597fcd5d-006f-43ee-bf88-fdfeaadd72e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:47:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628956076</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T15:48:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yuriko Nakao via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KATWIJK, NETHERLANDS - JANUARY 29: In this photo illustration, the logo of Reddit, a social news aggregation is pictured along with other apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp on a smartphone on January 29, 2021 in Katwijk, Netherlands.

That means that Green Bank, West Virginia has about as much tech today as it did in the 1950&#39;s (maybe even a little less) — and some people very much like it that way. But not everybody.

Reprinted by permission.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>For every electrosensitive who wanted radio quiet, there were probably one hundred residents who wanted WiFi and cell service, and they elected the county’s officials. In early 2018, the Pocahontas County Commission passed a resolution in support of cell service throughout the county, a challenge to the very notion of a Quiet Zone. The commission assigned its attorney, Robert Martin, to contact all major telecommunications providers asking them to invest in Pocahontas.</p><p>“I’m doing my level best to get another company in here,” Martin told me in the spring of 2018. He’d invited me to his house to discuss the new cell service ordinance, and we were swigging Bud Lights at his kitchen table.</p><p>“How many cell companies have you written to?” I asked.</p><p>“All of them,” he said. “I promised the companies that we’ll get everybody in the damn county to sign up with them. I’ll sign up first! . . . I wrote a letter to everybody and said, ‘We have shit for cellphone service here, we want you to come in here, we’ll partner with you, we’ll help you however we can. Come in here.’”</p><p>At our feet were two boxers and a basset hound. In the adjacent mudroom was a 250-pound Vietnamese potbellied pig named Pig, who was snoring. Pig knew how to open the front door and pull a blanket over himself. “I’m the true image of West Virginia, aren’t I?” Martin laughed. “I got a pig living in the house.” Despite his home literally being a pigsty, Martin was always the best dressed at county meetings, usually wearing tight designer jeans, leather boots, and a crisp dress shirt, top buttons undone and a few chest hairs curling out. A blustery guy, Martin was once jailed in Marlinton for contempt of court for arguing with a circuit judge. He had a history of getting into fights at West Virginia University football games. For years, he’d also operated a hotel in Belize, paying “tens of thousands of dollars in bribes” and putting the payments on his tax returns so the U.S. government could see the corruption he was dealing with (even if he was admitting to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). Martin came across as a dogged lawyer who knew how to get things done. And he wanted cell service.</p><p>“You seen that commercial saying Verizon has more coverage than anyone else?” he asked me. “Pause and look at it real closely, and you’ll see right where Pocahontas County is because almost the entire Eastern Seaboard is all yellow [signifying cell coverage] and right there in southeastern West Virginia there’s this hunk about this big—it’s Poca-fucking-hontas County. I swear to God. Right fucking there we are on Verizon’s commercials.”</p><p>Martin knew well what connectivity was like outside the Quiet Zone. He had earned his law degree from West Virginia University in 1979, married a girl from Marlinton, and started his career in Pocahontas County before becoming a well-heeled insurance defense lawyer in Charleston. He’d gotten his first cellphone in 1986—it was the size of a beer bottle, with a three-foot-long antenna, and it went to bed with him every night. That attachment ended in 2012 when he moved back to Pocahontas, where he only carried an iPhone so he could listen to music in his truck. I asked if he was concerned about the impact of cell service on the electrosensitives.</p><p>“Wackos that are afraid of their brains getting fried and all that?” he responded. “Yeah, I know about them.”</p><p>“They see Green Bank as a haven,” I said.</p><p>“So? <em>So?</em>” He said he wasn’t going to let the electrosensitives keep Pocahontas “behind the curve” for cell service.</p><p>“But I’m here <em>because </em>you’re behind the curve,” I said. “That makes this place unique.”</p><p>“You think we want to deal with stone knives and axes for the rest of our existence? You’re like these fucking people who move in here and don’t want it to change, that it? We have people who have moved here in the last five to ten years and they don’t want anything to change. They’ve ‘discovered’ Pocahontas County and now <em>nothing </em>can change. Well, <em>fuck, </em>that ain’t the way of the world. We have limitations because of the observatory, because of our topography, because of our insignificant population. But we need to do what we can as government entities to make things available to people.”</p><p>“Of course,” Martin added, the cell service would have to comply with the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“We believe in the observatory, we don’t want to fuck with them,” he said. “Right now, as you and I are sitting here bullshitting, they’re up there looking for fucking E.T. And I want to give them every opportunity to do that. But I’ve got emergency services I’ve got to render in this county.”</p><p>In addition to trying to bring in cell service, Martin was assisting the county’s emergency services director, Michael O’Brien, to improve communications. The 911 center in Marlinton had difficulty broadcasting any emergency radio communications toward the northern end of the county, where Green Bank was located. O’Brien found a partial solution by installing an internet-controlled radio system just north of Green Bank in the town of Durbin, but it had minimal range and failed altogether when internet or electricity went down. Pocahontas was also one of the only counties in the state unable to adopt a “smart radio system” that integrated radios with smartphones.</p><p>On the off chance that someone made an emergency 911 call from one of the county’s few pockets of limited cell service, authorities had an especially hard time pinpointing the person’s location. “We had a dispatcher spend two and a half hours on the phone one night with a lady that was trapped in her car in a creek,” O’Brien told me. “She didn’t know where she was or how she got there. We were just keeping her calm while we sent the department to look in all the areas that had cell service.”</p><p>ACCORDING TO DELOIT TE, a 10 percent increase in mobile penetration increases total factor productivity—a key component of economic growth modeling—by 4.2 percentage points over the long run. In Pocahontas, businesspeople like Kenneth “Buster” Varner felt they needed all the help they could get to keep the county’s economy puttering along, which meant bringing in cell service.</p><p>I first met Varner in early 2017, while eating breakfast at the counter at Station 2. A heavy, jowly man, he had leaned over and asked, “Do you think the gravy is too salty?” As we shoveled down heaping plates of biscuits and sausage gravy, he told me about his various businesses. Aside from owning Station 2, he operated a half dozen enterprises involved in logging, excavation, towing, septic pumping, and auto repair. He was also a fire chief. I told him that I imagined a lot of headaches trying to manage all those things within the restrictions of the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“You have to realize that we never had cellphone service when everybody else had it, so it wasn’t anything to us,” Varner said. “It’d be more convenient, of course, if it was so you could use your cellphones all the time. But it’s a unique place to live where you don’t have them, and we take a little pride in that.” He noted how the observatory provided jobs and shared its resources, such as lending one of its diesel generators to a funeral home during a recent power outage. “That to me means a lot,” Varner said. “And having the largest telescope in the world out your back door, that’s a pretty neat conversation piece.”</p><p>“People can get ahold of me the old-fashioned way,” he added. “Call me on the landline or come look for me.”</p><p>Spending more time with Varner, however, I realized that he was hardly a Luddite. When we met again months later in his cluttered office, I found it hard to keep his attention. He kept glancing down at his iPhone to check texts and alerts he was receiving over WiFi. When he took a call, I was left to stare at a poster of a busty woman in a red bikini and firefighter helmet. When he finally put down the iPhone, I told him I was confused. Hadn’t he said he took pride in not using a cellphone?</p><p>“I thought it was rude to have a smartphone,” Varner said of his “old” perspective, apparently from just a few months earlier. “I do a lot of business on that phone, more than I ever thought in my wildest dreams that I would do.” I asked if he could ever go back to living without one. “Wouldn’t want to. It’s so handy.”</p><p>Varner had an AT&amp;T data plan. He used Siri. He wished all his employees and volunteer firefighters could always be connected through smartphones. Instead, because of the Quiet Zone, he’d invested more than $30,000 in a specially approved radio repeater system to allow his workers to communicate via low-band radio. “I don’t want the observatory to close and for people to lose their jobs,” he said, “but it’d be more convenient for everybody.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-quiet-zone-stephen-kurczy-harper-collins-153030420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">288be526-c0d1-4fe0-8bea-7df5ae2d1e3b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880763</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:52:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GREEN BANK, WV-JUNE 07: The Robert C.

Some robots, like iRobot&#39;s Roomba i7+ and S9+, go one step further by automatically emptying their bins into their clean bases after each job — so you rarely have to take out its trash. These gadgets come with high price tags, but you can grab either of them for less right now at Wellbots. The online retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba i7+" href="https://fave.co/3dN1lpL">Roomba i7+</a> for $699, or $100 off, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:S9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">S9+</a> for $949, or $150 off, when you use the codes <strong>100ENGADGET</strong> and <strong>150ENGADGET</strong>, respectively, at checkout. While not all-time-low prices, they&#39;re the best prices we&#39;ve seen since April.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Roomba i7+ at Wellbots - $699" href="https://fave.co/3dN1lpL">Buy Roomba i7+ at Wellbots - $699</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Roomba S9+ at Wellbots - $949" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Buy Roomba S9+ at Wellbots - $949</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba i7+ is one of the more expensive robot vacuums you can get from iRobot and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-05-roomba-i7-plus-review.html">score of 87</a> when it first came out. Not only did it do a good job cleaning both carpeted and hard floors, but it was also quieter than other robot vacuums we&#39;ve tested. The i7+ also has smart mapping technology so it can keep track of the rooms in your home to clean more efficiently. And like other robo-vacs, you can control the i7+ from your smartphone, plus set cleaning schedules, using the iRobot mobile app.</p><p>But the biggest thing that sets the i7+ apart from others is its clean base. After each job, the robot will automatically empty its bin into the clean base so you don&#39;t have to worry about it. The clean base itself can hold about 30 jobs worth of dirt, so it won&#39;t require constant attention either. The only downside are iRobot&#39;s proprietary bags that you&#39;ll have to buy for it.</p><p>Overall, the i7+ is a good pick if you want a robot vacuum that requires little attention on a daily basis. The Roomba S9+ has all of the same features plus a more corner-friendly design and &quot;power-lift suction,&quot; which should help it do a better job deep-cleaning carpets and capturing pet hair.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-i7-plus-s9-plus-deal-wellbots-130005973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99ece9ac-a06f-4e1a-ab10-93881db30595</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 13:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880609</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:50:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s high-end Roomba i7+ and S9+ are up to $150 off at Wellbots]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. 'Reminiscence' promo uses deepfake tech to put you in the trailer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to see yourself on screen with Hugh Jackman, this is your chance. The promo for Warner Bros. upcoming <em>Reminiscence</em> movie uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucasfilm-hires-shamook-054904077.html">deepfake</a> technology to turn a photo of your face — or anybody&#39;s face, really — into a short video sequence with the star. According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/next-up/warner-bros-deepfake-movie-promo?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, a media startup called D-ID created the promo for the film. D-ID reportedly started out wanting to develop technology that can protect consumers against facial recognition, but then it realized that its tech could also be used to optimize deepfakes.</p><p>For this particular project, the firm created a <a href="https://www.bannisterandassociates.com/">website</a> for the experience, where you&#39;ll be asked for your name and for a photo. You can upload the photo of anybody you want, and the experience will then conjure up an animation for the face in it. The animation isn&#39;t perfect by any means, and the face could look distorted at times, but it&#39;s still not bad, considering the technology created it from a single picture.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Reminiscence</em> is a sci-fi thriller about Nick Bannister, a &quot;private investigator of the mind.&quot; The idea behind the promo is that you&#39;re a client looking into your memories to solve a case. The movie will be shown in theatres on August 20th, but like most new releases these days, it will also be available for streaming on HBO Max.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d22650-fcbf-11eb-b557-b55ae3f25f9a" style="height:465;width:800;" alt="Reminiscence" data-uuid="058a5161-e976-3768-b845-6795518f9c54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-reminiscence-promo-deepfake-trailer-052114554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c509528e-e1fd-4c73-ab83-ce16064c0c97</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 05:21:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628918539</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T05:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple clarifies its sex abuse scans would look for 'images flagged in multiple countries']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple, which basked in praise from many corners after refusing to cooperate with federal authorities <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-16-judge-tells-apple-to-help-fbi-access-san-bernardino-shooters-ip.html">following the 2016 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California</a>, is now aggressively walking back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html">its plans to unilaterally scan customers&#39; phones for child porn</a> on behalf of governments following a swift and furious backlash from privacy advocates. Per a Friday afternoon report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-criticism-apple-only-seek-abuse-images-flagged-multiple-nations-2021-08-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the tech company clarified that it will only utilize its proposed  system to look for images that have already &quot;been flagged by clearinghouses in multiple countries.&quot;</p><p>An initial threshold of 30 images would have to be discovered before the automated scanning system alerted Apple that an actual human should review the issue, though the company explained that the figure would eventually be reduced in the future.

Apple did assert that the program was &quot;still in development&quot; and that mulligans like this were a normal part of the production process.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of scanning user accounts for contraband images is old hat for the tech industry, however Apple&#39;s plan to install the monitoring software directly on the hardware itself is an unprecedented move — one that has privacy advocates up in arms.

On Friday, a federal judge with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary decision related to a complaint the company had filed against Google in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html">early 2020</a>, alleging the search giant had infringed on five of its patents. Validating all five claims, the judge said Google should not be allowed to import devices that violate the intellectual property of Sonos.</p><p>&quot;Today the ALJ has found all five of Sonos&#39; asserted patents to be valid and that Google infringes on all five patents. We are pleased the ITC has confirmed Google&#39;s blatant infringement of Sonos&#39; patented inventions,&quot; said Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus. &quot;This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"><em>The New York Times</em> notes</a>, the judge&#39;s decision isn&#39;t final.

It accused the company of copying some of the technologies most critical to its speakers, including its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-29-sonos-trueplay-calibration.html">Trueplay tuning tool</a>. In patent disputes, companies typically use simultaneous ITC complaints to force the hand of their opponent since the body tends to resolve matters faster than a traditional court. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-sonos-patent-infringement-132548465.html">subsequently countersued Sonos</a>, claiming the company had been using its search, software, networking and audio processing technologies without paying the proper licensing fees.

In a <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/">post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623354/facebook-instagram-algorithm-watch-research-legal-threat"><em>The Verge</em></a>, AlgorithmWatch claims the company accused it of breaching Instagram’s terms of service and said it would move to take “more formal engagement” if the project did not “resolve” the issue.</p><p>AlgorithmWatch’s research centered around a browser plugin more than 1,500 individuals downloaded. The tool helped the team to collect information it says allowed it to make some inferences about how Instagram prioritizes specific photos and videos over others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most notably, the team found the platform <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-nudity/">encourages people to show skin</a>. Before publishing its findings, AlgorithmWatch said it had reached out to Facebook for comment, only for the company not to respond initially. However, in May 2020, Facebook told the researchers their work was “flawed in a number of ways” after it said earlier in the year it found a list of issues with the methodology AlgorithmWatch had employed.</p><p>When Facebook accused AlgorithmWatch of breaching its terms of service, the company pointed to a section of its rules that prohibits automated data collection. It also said the system violated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-04-who-controls-your-data.html">GDPR</a>, the European Union’s data privacy law. “We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,” AlgorithmWatch said. “In other words, users of the plugin [were] only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.” As for Facebook’s allegations related to GDPR, the group said, “<a href="https://github.com/algorithmwatch/tami-tools/blob/main/backend/data_donors/serializers.py#L88-L89">a cursory look at the source code</a>, which we open-sourced, shows that such data was deleted immediately when arriving at our server.”</p><p>Despite the belief they had done nothing wrong, the researchers eventually decided to shutter the project. “Ultimately, an organization the size of AlgorithmWatch cannot risk going to court against a company valued at one trillion dollars,” they said.</p><p>When Engadget reached out to Facebook for comment on the situation, the company denied it had threatened to sue the researchers. Here’s the full text of what it had to say:</p><blockquote><p>We believe in independent research into our platform and have worked hard to allow many groups to do it, including AlgorithmWatch — but just not at the expense of anyone’s privacy. We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns. We did not threaten to sue them. The signatories of this letter believe in transparency — and so do we. We collaborate with hundreds of research groups to enable the study of important topics, including by providing data sets and access to APIs, and recently published information explaining how our systems work and why you see what you see on our platform. We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don’t put people’s data or privacy at risk.</p></blockquote><p>This episode with AlgorithmWatch has worrisome parallels with actions Facebook took earlier in the month against a project called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html">NYU Ad Observatory</a>, which had been studying how political advertisers target their ads. Facebook has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-researcher-api-fringe-groups-195545901.html">some tools in place</a> to assist researchers in their work, but for the most part, its platforms have been a black box since the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. That’s a significant problem, as AlgorithmWatch points out.</p><p>“Large platforms play an oversized, and largely unknown, role in society, from identity-building to voting choices,” it said. “Only if we understand how our public sphere is influenced by their algorithmic choices, can we take measures towards ensuring they do not undermine individuals’ autonomy, freedom, and the collective good.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/algorithmwatch-facebook-shutdown-184729493.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42eab110-cc7a-4b65-9e01-43a19e6ff893</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 18:47:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880453</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:47:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5fea3070-fc62-11eb-bddb-f95f014d45bc" width="3500" height="2262" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5fea3070-fc62-11eb-bddb-f95f014d45bc" width="3500" height="2262" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee writes a note on the message board at the new headquarters of Facebook in Menlo Park, California January 11, 2012.

But with the Delta variant’s rapid spread threatening to send the country back into another round of social isolation, state and local governments (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/vaccine-mandates-proof">and numerous businesses</a>) are seeking to strike a balance between <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-to-become-second-U-S-city-to-16382500.php">the public’s health and the nation’s economic needs</a> through the use of digital vaccine cards, aka “vaccine passports.” But, unlike the mRNA vaccine itself, these passports are not quite the magic bullets against COVID we had hoped.</p><p>Vaccine passports, either physical or digital records certifying that a person has been fully vaccinated against a disease, have been around <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/04/08/985032748/the-vaccine-passport-debate-actually-began-in-1897-over-a-plague-vaccine">since the 19th century</a>. As early as the 1880s, students and educators in the US were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-apps.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock">required to show proof of immunization against smallpox</a> before attending classes. In 1897 Russian scientist Waldemar Haffkine developed a vaccine against the bubonic plague. His breakthrough treatment was immediately put to use by the British colonizers of India. To help ensure that densely populated Hindu and Muslim pilgrimage sites in the country did not mutate into outbreak clusters of the disease, the local government began requiring proof of vaccination by every pilgrim before entering these sites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the rise of air travel in the second half of the 20th century, the United Nations adopted similar rules in 1951 and then again in 1969, dubbed the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations">International Health Regulations</a>. These regulations, along with widespread outbreaks of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/index.html#:~:text=Yellow%20fever%20is%20a%20very,person&#39;s%20symptoms%2C%20and%20travel%20history.">yellow fever</a>, led to the advent of “yellow cards,” which international travellers have carried for decades to certify their immunization against a wide variety of infectious diseases.</p><p>Yellow fever is currently the only disease currently on the IHR for which countries can demand vaccination proof as a condition of entering the country, though the UN’s regulations on any disease are advisory and non-binding in nature so the responsibility for adhering to and implementing those rules falls to individual nations.</p><p>In response to the COVID pandemic, many nations already have embraced a new generation of vaccine passports. Israel has the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-vaccinations.html">Green Pass</a>, Denmark has the <a href="https://en.coronasmitte.dk/corona-passport">Coronapas</a>, the European Union (but not the UK) offers the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57665765">EU Digital Covid Certificate</a>, China rolled out its vaccine passport <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-rolls-out-vaccine-passport">as a WeChat mini app in March</a>, and Estonia uses <a href="https://guardtime.com/vaccineguard">VaccineGuard</a>. Even private businesses are considering implementing their own systems. United, JetBlue and Lufthansa, for example, are rolling out CommonPass, a system designed to verify an international passenger’s COVID testing and vaccination status.</p><p>“This is likely to be a new normal need that we’re going to have to deal with to control and contain this pandemic,” Dr. Brad Perkins, chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, the nonprofit that developed CommonPass, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-apps.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock"><em>The New York Times</em></a> in December.</p><p>The Biden administration has made clear that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/white-house-says-u-s-won-t-issue-vaccine-passports">it does not support the creation of a vaccine passport program at the Federal level</a>. The President did, however, issue an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/21/executive-order-promoting-covid-19-safety-in-domestic-and-international-travel/">executive order in January</a> directing the State Department to work with the WHO and international aviation and travel agencies to develop standards for post-pandemic travel.</p><p>“The federal government is working on this issue of vaccine credentialing or vaccine verification or what some people call vaccine passports. So we’re going to be following carefully what the federal government comes out with,” Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, told the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/New-York-allows-them-Florida-bans-them-Will-16073145.php"><em>SF Chronicle</em></a> in April. “If they don’t move fast enough, we will come out with technical standards of what we expect and also really focusing on making sure that that privacy is protected and that equity is protected.”</p><p>Instead, Americans are offers a hodgepodge of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-san-francisco-d527b25676d5f450bb7042eb8c32534d">local and state regulations</a>, at least those states that haven&#39;t banned certification systems — looking at you, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/which-states-have-banned-vaccine-passports">Arkansas, Texas, Florida, and Indiana</a> — despite clear legal precedent affirming the government’s authority to temporarily abridge certain individual rights during a public health crisis (see: <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/"><em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em></a>).</p><p>Take California, for example. The Golden State recently rolled out the <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a>, a system that securely pulls the data stored in the California immunization registry. It’s the same state-collected vaccination data that is seen on the paper cards issued when you got your shots — specifically your name, date of birth, vaccination dates, and vaccine manufacturer.</p><p>“It’s not a passport. It’s not a requirement. It’s just the ability now to have an electronic version of that paper version,” California Governor Gavin Newsom explained during a press conference announcing the system’s rollout in June.</p><p>The system can also store a scannable QR code on your mobile device so that businesses and venues that do require certification of full vaccination prior to entry can do so easily. The QR code is built on the non-profit <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">SMART Health Card</a> technology, which means that only SMART-compatible scanners can actually read the codes. And <a href="https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-require-proof-vaccination-entry-certain-indoor-businesses-and-all-large-indoor">in San Francisco, that’s literally all of them</a>. This is a built-in security feature ensuring that some random clown at the bar can’t surreptitiously scan your code using the generic QR reader on their phone and get access to your information.</p><p>However, the system’s rollout has not been without its hiccups. This reporter specifically has spent the past six weeks attempting to resolve an issue with incomplete vaccination data being reported to the registry. (Basically, it reads that my second dose is the only dose I received.) The CDPH declined to comment on how many Californians have registered for the service and how many of those registrants have run into similar problems, though the agency has set up a <a href="https://chat.myturn.ca.gov/?id=17">virtual agent</a> to help guide users through the process of alerting the state to any mistakes or omissions.</p><p>New York, on the other hand, has not one but two competing vaccine verification systems, neither of which has proven particularly reliable, trustworthy or useful. At the state level, you’ve got the Excelsior Pass, which operates in a similar fashion to California’s DCVR system — pulling immunization data directly from the state’s registry — and leverages IBM’s proprietary blockchain technology to maintain data security and user privacy. At the local level, New York City has rolled out a passport app of its own, dubbed the NYC COVID Safe App, which for all intents and purposes is a half-assed image storage app that is ridiculously easy to spoof.</p><div id="ec5ee8ed48b04662a395470ff81247f8"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I explained to <a href="https://twitter.com/WNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WNYC</a> today, New York City&#39;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYCCovidSafe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NYCCovidSafe</a> app isn&#39;t exactly cutting edge technology.

And then you&#39;re done.&quot;</p><p>This feat was easily replicated by other users, including San Francisco-based journalist Cyrus Farivar, who used the menu from a local BBQ joint as his photo.</p><div id="843baa9c37c4454d959f46736fd5e5de"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have replicated <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxCahn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FoxCahn</a>’s test.<br><br>The new NYC Covid Safe app accepted this picture of a menu from <a href="https://twitter.com/4505_Meats?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@4505_Meats</a> in San Francisco as proof of my valid vaccine. <a href="https://t.co/4xVQCwBi2a">pic.twitter.com/4xVQCwBi2a</a></p>— Cyrus Farivar (@cfarivar) <a href="https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/1422635711841259521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>“The NYC COVID Safe App was designed with privacy at the top of mind, and allows someone to digitally store their CDC card and identification,” Laura Feyer, spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-new-covid-vaccine-passport-simply-glorified-photo-storage-app-critics-say"><em>Gothamist</em></a> in response to these reports. “Someone checking vaccination cards at the door to a restaurant or venue would see that those examples are not proper vaccine cards and act accordingly.”</p><p>“The functionality of this app really raises the question, why did the city create it to begin with, because like so many other vaccinated New Yorkers, I had a photo album with my vaccine card months ago,” Cahn told Engadget. “It&#39;s unclear how this was anything more than a publicity stunt to roll it out as a new city app.”</p><p>“And then on top of that, to then make these broad sweeping statements that how the app is unhackable and to also say that there&#39;s no privacy impact when the app is also collecting your IP address and record of every time it&#39;s open,” he continued. “It&#39;s not a huge amount of IP information but it&#39;s information that the city was never collecting before, it&#39;s information that they simply don&#39;t need.”</p><p>What’s more, the NYC COVID Safe app’s lackisadical security also makes it prone to exploitation by anti-vaxxers, like noted area conspiracy theorist, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/09/joe-rogan-rips-vaccine-passports-as-moving-closer-to-dictatorship/">Joe Rogan</a>. Since the app doesn’t independently verify any of the information it is displaying, instead relying on bar, venue and restaurant staffers to make the determination as to whether a photo is legitimate or not, malicious users could easily upload a photo of any vaccine card — whether it’s been photoshopped, acquired from a friend or bought on on the black market (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-education-fake-vaccination-cards-8c4ca2b4d54434c2fc022b34087df8cb">for $400</a>).</p><p>The state-run Excelsior Pass has run into <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2104289">privacy issues</a> of its own. For one, its reliance on IBM’s blackbox blockchain system provides virtually no accountability or transparency in how the system actually operates.</p><p>The “thing is highly engineered, it has all these layers of registration, verification, and a customized QR code,” Cahn said. “That&#39;s raising far more important privacy issues because the state is quite clear that it doesn&#39;t use location services. But since each scanner is registered to a specific business address, every time you scan that QR code, the state and IBM are collecting a record of where you were and when, and we haven&#39;t done any clear information on how long that data is retained.”</p><p>What’s more, an experiment conducted in April by Cahn found that even with the blockchain assurances, the app was remarkably easy to hack. “After getting consent from an Excelsior Pass user, I tried to download their pass, logging into their account using nothing more than public information from social media. Eleven minutes after he gave me the greenlight, I had a copy of his blue Excelsior Pass in hand, valid for use until September,” Cahn wrote for the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-forged-new-yorks-digital-vaccine-passport-in-11-minutes-flat"><em>Daily Beast</em></a>.</p><p>“This city app really just speaks to the dysfunction. Here in New York, the rivalry between the city and state, the fact that we have a mayor and the governor who can&#39;t stand each other, and it is not addressing a technical need,” he lamented. “These apps are such a debacle that we just need to go back to old-fashioned paper records.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/these-vaccine-passports-are-why-we-can-have-nice-things-180018254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0941660f-cf43-4c3f-858a-112bf9d2cd19</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 18:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880288</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:45:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/109a12c0-72d7-11eb-bfdf-a67ba0167c7c" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/109a12c0-72d7-11eb-bfdf-a67ba0167c7c" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LEREXIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[a series of photos showing a mobile application with a QR code showing a health passport for covid-19]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[QR code for verification of immunization after vaccination with covid vaccine - 19]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls’ will soon be revived on Apple Arcade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new(ish) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/castlevania"><ins>Castlevania</ins></a> game is on the way to Apple Arcade. <em>Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls </em>is coming soon to iOS, tvOS and Mac via the subscription service.

Thankfully, almost everything you need to know about the car is in its model designation: LPI 800-4. The first part is short for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, referencing how the powertrain is mounted lengthwise toward the back of the supercar and the fact that it&#39;s a hybrid. Meanwhile, the two numbers point to the approximately 802 horsepower the Countach&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-lamborghini-sian-hybrid-technology-interview.html">V12 6.5-liter engine</a> and 48-volt electric motor can output together, as well as the fact that it has four-wheel drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e0dbabf0-fc53-11eb-bf3f-9ef15cf71548" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" data-uuid="5989dadc-a19b-37b8-9284-658f816c4ba7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>All of that makes for one powerful car. The Countach can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds and zero to 124 miles per hour in just under nine seconds. As for a top speed, you can push it to 221 miles per hour, and it has a maximum torque of 531 lb-ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0f7e9b20-fc54-11eb-87f9-0ad0a427852c" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach cockpit" data-uuid="8d1554f6-f008-3ffa-8360-e9521052c163"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>Powering the Countach&#39;s electric motor is a supercapacitor Lamborghini claims delivers three times more power compared to a lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The automaker says it mounted the electric motor directly to the gearbox to preserve the feeling of power transfer you get from a V12 engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Carbon fiber makes up most of the chassis and exterior of the Countach LPI 800-4. &quot;It imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade,&quot; Lamborghini says of the design, which is more reminiscent of the Aventador than its original namesake. Inside, you&#39;ll find an 8.4-inch touchscreen display that includes CarPlay integration and a button labeled &quot;Stile.&quot; Pressing it &quot;explains the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3d4b75a0-fc54-11eb-ab2b-040a245611d6" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" data-uuid="076479b9-68b5-3c95-8c5d-e3cecc63e4ba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini</div></figure><p>Speaking of a privileged audience, Lamborghini will only make 112 units of the Countach LPI 800-4. The press release the automaker sent over doesn&#39;t even mention a price tag. It seems Lamborghini is keen on looking forward, but the Countach was too important not to acknowledge with a limited run.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-countach-lpi-800-4-annoucement-173013169.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">481624c2-c989-4d5a-ad34-f79d5dd4930c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 17:30:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628873278</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T16:48:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/36f03890-fc53-11eb-87ff-369bc611914e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/36f03890-fc53-11eb-87ff-369bc611914e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lamborghini]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
