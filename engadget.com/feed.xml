The panel found that out of eight federal bodies, including the departments of State, Transportation and Education, only Homeland Security complied with the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act">Federal Information Security Modernization Act</a> (FISMA), an Obama-era law Congress passed to enable the US government to better respond to online threats.</p><p>&quot;All agencies failed to comply with statutory requirements to certify to Congress they have implemented certain key cybersecurity requirements including encryption of sensitive data, least privilege and multi-factor authentication,&quot; the report said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6b6faae31280473596e4cb52eade3ff8"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This morning as Ranking Member of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HSGAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HSGAC</a> I released a bipartisan report w Chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/SenGaryPeters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenGaryPeters</a> on fed cybersecurity &amp; how America’s data is still at risk. The report shows a sustained failure to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities at our fed agencies. <a href="https://t.co/DqwMnY6own">https://t.co/DqwMnY6own</a></p>— Rob Portman (@senrobportman) <a href="https://twitter.com/senrobportman/status/1422545703142834192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>As <a href="https://therecord.media/bipartisan-report-finds-agencies-plagued-by-cyber-woes/"><em>The Record </em>points out</a>, one of the more glaring oversights the panel found was that the State Department left thousands of employee accounts on its classified and unclassified networks active even after those individuals left the agency. In another particularly worrisome example, the Department of Agriculture had vulnerabilities on its websites that it wasn&#39;t aware of. What&#39;s more, at least seven of the eight agencies the panel audited were using outdated and unsupported IT systems, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. &quot;It is clear that the data entrusted to these eight agencies remains at risk,&quot; the report said.</p><p>&quot;From <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-federal-prosecutors-160655082.html">SolarWinds</a> to recent ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure, it&#39;s clear that cyberattacks are going to keep coming,&quot; Senator Rob Portman, the panel&#39;s top Republican, <a href="https://twitter.com/senrobportman/status/1422545705252569112?s=20">said on Twitter</a>. &quot;It is unacceptable that our own federal agencies are not doing everything possible to safeguard America&#39;s data. I am concerned that many of these vulnerabilities have been outstanding for the better part of a decade — the American people deserve better.&quot;</p><p>Among other recommendations, the report highlights the need for a single agency to oversee federal cybersecurity. To that end, the panel suggests Congress update the Federal Information Security Modernization Act to make the law better reflect current cybersecurity practices and establish the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jen-easterly-cisa-head-092048460.html">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> as the federal lead for those types of issues. It also recommends amending FISMA to require agencies to notify both CISA and, in some instances, Congress when they become entangled in a major incident.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-homeland-security-committee-federal-cybersecurity-report-153405169.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b26d898-dd9a-4eaa-bd96-b33a00d6fa7d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:34:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628004848</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T15:34:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ff5c640-f46c-11eb-bffb-5d043278738b" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ff5c640-f46c-11eb-bffb-5d043278738b" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Brenner / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) walks along news reporters before attending a vote, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 23, 2021.

NASA is launching Starliner Orbital Flight Test-2 from Cape Canaveral today (August 3rd) at 1:20PM Eastern, with a livestream available from NASA&#39;s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF9LpNpNjNI">channel</a> (below) starting at 12:30PM ET. If successful, the unoccupied spacecraft will deliver over 400lbs of cargo to the International Space Station before returning to Earth with 550lbs of material.</p><p>Starliner will start an orbital insertion burn about 30 minutes after launch. You&#39;ll have to be patient after that, though. The capsule isn&#39;t expected expected to dock with the ISS until August 4th at 1:37PM ET, and will touch down in the western US after its &quot;daylong&quot; mission.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The vessel was originally supposed to launch on July 30th, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-boeing-delay-starliner-iss-launch-092458695.html">was delayed</a> after the new Russian ISS module Nauka accidentally activated and forced a correction.</p><p>Much depends on a successful flight. Boeing and NASA will follow a successful test with six crew rotation missions. For Boeing, this is also about pride. SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-dragon-successful-splashdown-184812158.html">successfully launching a crewed capsule</a> in 2020, and is already performing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-splashdown-record-144301622.html">crewed operational flights</a>. The sooner Starliner is cleared to launch with people aboard, the sooner Boeing can catch up and play a key role in the privatization of spaceflight.</p><div id="24229a4115e44b1cb712ac85e3f7139b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF9LpNpNjNI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-boeing-starliner-iss-launch-153058519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51486434-f005-4119-acfc-398283cf529b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:30:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628000536</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T14:22:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84b25070-f458-11eb-bd27-aa55389bc692" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84b25070-f458-11eb-bd27-aa55389bc692" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/Joel Kowsky]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boeing Starliner aboard ULA Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boeing Starliner aboard ULA Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID is now available separately for $149]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months after it introduced new Touch ID-enabled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/touch-id-apple-imac-wireless-174826559.html"><ins>Magic Keyboards</ins></a> along with M1 Macs, Apple is now selling the peripheral separately.

The final part of the program, “Capstone,” sees students asked to create and present projects that use AI to impact society.</p><p>For Intel, the company says working with community colleges offers a chance to “democratize AI technology.” Citing <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/research-trends/fast-facts/">data from the American Association of Community Colleges</a>, the company notes they attract people from various backgrounds and walks of life. But as with most programs of this type, it’s also an opportunity for the company to find candidates in a demanding field. It’s no accident then Intel plans to expand the program to include 50 more schools by 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ai-for-workforce-2021-expansion-130027058.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fbb046d-fd61-41f2-8050-33a185a156a2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627989377</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T11:16:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Schools]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JLab debuts $20 true wireless earbuds with 8-hour battery life and touch controls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, I found out just how solid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">a pair of $29 true wireless earbuds</a> could be. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-jlab-go-air-wireless-earbuds.html">JLab&#39;s Go Air</a> covers all the basics even though they lack the polish of more expensive sets. For its latest buds, <a href="https://www.jlab.com/products/go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds">the Go Air Pop</a>, the company is taking things a step further with better battery life and a fully enclosed charging case. JLab cut the price even more too: these earbuds will only cost you $20.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Go Air, you&#39;ll get all of the core functionality of true wireless earbuds with the Go Air Pop. That includes on-board touch controls, the ability to use either earbud independently, EQ presets and IPX4 moisture resistance. The overall design of the buds is also similar, although JLab says the Go Air Pop is 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the Go Air.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13b91bf0-f40e-11eb-a57d-e6fed4130f41" alt="JLab Go Air Pop" data-uuid="9a1f3b2f-d6c9-3b9e-86cc-a77467a1d9b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLab</div></figure><p>The biggest differences are the case and the battery life. The Go Air comes in an open case with an attached USB cable that tucks in the bottom. The integrated plug is back on the Go Air Pop, but the case has a lid like almost every other set of true wireless buds.  JLab extended battery life to eight hours on the buds themselves, up from five on the Go Air. The case will give you three additional charges before you&#39;ll need to plug the whole set in.&nbsp;</p><p>JLab isn&#39;t the only company cranking out sub-$30 true wireless earbuds. Skullcandy debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-dime-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-120012848.html">the $25 Dime</a> back in March, a set of buds with a more AirPod-like design. The Dime can only muster three and a half hours on a charge, but it does offer on-board controls and IPX4 water resistance for your workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The Go Air Pop will ship in late August. When it does, you can choose between black, lilac, rose, slate and teal color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2799a6f1-c087-4045-a8a8-57e4f6152655</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627963302</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T04:01:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JLab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Realme's 'MagDart' is an Android take on MagSafe, but faster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-magsafe-iphone-173957651.html">MagSafe</a> made its grand return by way of the iPhone 12 series, it was only a matter of time before other phone makers came up with similar — and maybe better — solutions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/realme">Realme</a>, the sister brand of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oppo">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oneplus">OnePlus</a>, has announced its very own &quot;MagDart&quot; magnetic wireless charging system as part of its latest concept phone, the Flash.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5228b560-f451-11eb-bbbf-4037e39b11e5" style="height:1011;width:1600;" alt="Realme 50W MagDart" data-uuid="245e2e67-8483-3fe4-aa35-70ee20534983"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>Not only is MagDart the first of its kind in the Android world, it&#39;s also more powerful than Apple&#39;s MagSafe, with its maximum output rated at 50W instead of just 15W. This 50W magnetic charger leverages Realme&#39;s speedy 65W SuperDart charging tech — a rebranded version of Oppo&#39;s SuperVOOC and OnePlus&#39; Warp Charge 65 — and has its own air-cooling system for maximum performance. Realme claims that the charging speed here is almost on par with its 50W SuperDart wired charger. Specifically, for the 4,500mAh battery inside the Realme Flash, it&#39;ll go from zero to 100 percent in under an hour.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The downside of this 50W MagDart charger is its bulkiness, but Realme will also offer a slim 15W MagDart charging pad — one that&#39;s a tad thinner than Apple&#39;s MagSafe charger. This design is mainly thanks to having the circuit board tucked away in the plug, which also keeps the charging coil cooler for higher efficiency. For the same phone, this will take about 90 minutes to go from zero to 100 percent.</p><p>Naturally, the MagDart ecosystem offers a few other snap-on accessories as well. There&#39;s a MagDart power bank which one-ups the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-147-magsafe-battery-pack-apple-card-podcasts-homepod-192323154.html">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> by doubling as a wireless charging stand, so you can charge or grab both the phone and the power bank simultaneously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65a17320-f451-11eb-b976-2d90c15961fa" style="height:758;width:1516;" alt="MagDart 2-in-1 power bank, 50W MagDart charger, 15W MagDart charger, MagDart beauty light, MagDart wallet and MagDart case for Realme GT." data-uuid="6090cf69-d685-3473-8db4-45b43744fb02"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>There&#39;s also a MagDart Beauty Light, which is a flip-up ring light — consisting of 60 mini LEDs, with adjustable brightness and color temperature — to keep your selfie game strong. Interestingly, this kit is powered by the phone&#39;s reverse wireless charging feature.</p><p>Another handy accessory here is the self-explanatory MagDart Wallet, which holds up to three credit cards in its vegan leather pockets. Though unlike the MagSafe version, this one adds an aluminum kickstand to your phone as well.</p><p>Last but not least, existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-snapdragon-888-launch-price-availability-184917902.html">Realme GT</a> users can get a special case to make their phone MagDart-compatible, though this will add a slight bulge near the bottom on the back side.</p><p>There&#39;s no word on when we will see the first MagDart-compatible devices on the market just yet, but when that happens, chances are future products from Oppo and OnePlus will get to share the love with Realme (unless Apple gets in the way, of course).

The Alexa-powered smart display is also currently available for $45 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html">on Best Buy</a>, but you now have another option if you&#39;d rather purchase it from Amazon for Prime shipping or any other reason.

And, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review of the newer device</a>, its changes are pretty minor. Instead of a one-megapixel camera, you now get 2 megapixels, which isn&#39;t that much of an upgrade. The newer smart display also comes in a light blue option, while its predecessor is only available in black and white. That&#39;s pretty much it, though — the display&#39;s resolution remains the same, and it still doesn&#39;t come with features its bigger counterpart, the Echo Show 8, has.</p><p>As we said in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">review</a> for the first-gen Echo Show 5, it&#39;s meant for those who want a smaller Amazon smart display that&#39;s also a decent alarm clock. It has a sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens the screen 15 minutes before the time you set, and it has ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the screen&#39;s brightness based on your surroundings. You can also use it to display photos and watch videos, though, if you don&#39;t mind the smaller screen. The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, and you can always access YouTube using its built-in browsers.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-gen-echo-show-5-all-time-low-amazon-122943901.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48f7402f-31e5-4a09-8887-7781f1bcf23d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 12:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627993821</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:30:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is offering $10 in credit for your palm print]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is offering $10 in promotional credit to get people to sign up to its palm print payments system. Our sister site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>spotted the promotional offer and shared a screenshot of it, which you can peep below. The retailer launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-palm-recognition-go-stores-seattle-100718649.html">Amazon One</a> last fall as a contactless way of authenticating purchases and allowing entry into stores using a biometric device. In this case, a palm scanner.

You can find the tech at Amazon Go convenience stores, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star stores and Amazon Pop Ups.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shoppers can enroll on Amazon One at those sites by pairing their credit card and mobile number with one or both of their palm signatures. The sign-up process is the only part that requires you to touch the device. After that, you just hover your palm over the scanner to enter a store and complete purchases. The promotion also requires you to link your Amazon account with your One ID.</p><p>The limited number of Amazon One locations means that the promo will be restricted to a small circle of users. But, if Amazon gets its way, the system may be hard to avoid in a contactless, check-out free future.

Improvements are teased across voice and speech processing — think Google Assistant — as well as photography and video recording, which all sounds like the sixth addition will continue to play to the Pixel series’ strengths.</p><p>Rick Osterloh, in conversation with Engadget, explained — but without getting specific — that the Pixel 6 series will include larger imaging sensors than before. He said the Pixel 6’s main camera will let in about 150% more light than previous Pixels. The Pro alone gets an extra telephoto option with 4x optical zoom, which will certainly help me decide between the two.

Researchers were able to capture the light from the back of a supermassive black hole 800 million light-years away.</p><p>Stanford astrophysicist Dan Wilkins says this is a &quot;key part of the puzzle to understanding&quot; how the universe came to be. While studying the bright flares of x-rays emanating from the black hole, researchers spotted fainter flashes of light. These were the &quot;luminous echoes&quot; of the flares bouncing off the gas behind the black hole. These phenomena were first predicted by Einstein in his theory of relativity, published in 1916. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-hole-light-behind-092317917.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-lite-113540988.html">YouTube tests a cheaper subscription that only removes ads</a></h2><h3>Trials are happening in Europe.</h3><h3></h3><p>YouTube is testing a lower-priced subscription plan that forgoes offline downloads and background playback but nixes all ads across videos.

Chrome OS version 92 will make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-tile-grid-view-mobile-video-calls-141248301.html">Google Meet</a> a pre-installed Progressive Web App on all Chromebooks and computers running the software, allowing users to get on a video call right from the Launcher.

The feature sounds especially useful for travelers who need to switch between networks while they&#39;re overseas.

Following news of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-lite-113540988.html">YouTube Premium Lite</a> offering yesterday, Spotify is the latest streamer to confirm a cheaper tier. The world&#39;s biggest music streaming service is testing a $0.99 monthly plan that retains the ads but gives you infinite skips per hour and lets you select specific songs on an album or playlist for playback. Spotify, which confirmed the test to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607203/spotify-plus-ad-supported-tier-unlimited-skips-on-demand-listening"><em>The Verge</em></a>, is hoping it can convince you to put up with ads in return for more control over the listening experience. In other words, it wants to have its cake and eat it, too.</p><p>Currently, free users can only skip six tracks per hour and have to listen to shuffled songs on albums and playlists. That&#39;s a bummer if you&#39;re sick of hearing Justin Bieber or just want to put that one new Billie Eillish track on repeat. Despite those incentives, getting people to pay for an ad-supported service, even if it is just $0.99 per month, is still a big ask. Especially when they&#39;re accustomed to getting it for free. Then again, video streamers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-31-hulu-ads-pause-break-spring.html">Hulu</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-ad-supported-plan-details-release-date-165738658.html">HBO Max</a> have either successfully done it or are trying to do it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The risk is that it could eat into Spotify&#39;s existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-q2-2021-premium-users-103530500.html">premium user base</a>, which make up 165 million of its 365 million subscribers. Turning those remaining 200 million users into paying members is clearly the goal here. It could be that the low $0.99 price helps to ease that transition. We&#39;ll know if the gamble has paid off if Spotify expands the plan to more users. In the past, the company has done just that with new plans, including its $12.99/month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-premium-duo-streaming-plan-us-pricing-details-100016592.html">Duo</a> tier aimed at discouraging password sharing and its upcoming Lossless &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">HiFi</a>&quot; offering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-free-skip-tracks-100956489.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d35dd796-e459-4312-92d5-3578e5740c63</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 10:09:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627985399</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T10:10:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27552d70-f440-11eb-8ffe-88fedd1033ca" width="4017" height="2678" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27552d70-f440-11eb-8ffe-88fedd1033ca" width="4017" height="2678" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Taylor Hill via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - MAY 20:  Spotify founder Daniel Ek speaks during the Spotify New Platform Launch at S.I.R.

The key product is the Zone True Wireless Earbuds, which the company says are the first to be certified by the three major video conferencing platforms: Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Another unique feature is support for not just Bluetooth, but Logitech&#39;s wireless USB receiver as well, so that they&#39;ll work with almost any smartphone or computer — and let you flip easily between devices.</p><p>The wireless buds come with active noise cancellation (ANC) and a noise cancelling mic, allowing for high-quality sound on calls, Logitech claims. And unlike bulky wireless headsets designed for businesses (like Logitech&#39;s own <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/headsets/zone-wireless-bluetooth.html">Zone models</a>), they&#39;re designed to provide a &quot;stylish look&quot; when you&#39;re on a Zoom or other conference call.

The audio quality remains to be heard and reviewed, of course, but they&#39;re certainly nicer looking than most business headsets.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the Zone True Wireless  model, Logitech also debuted the Zone Wired Earbuds &quot;for professionals and teams who want a professional-grade, plug-and-play option,&quot; the company said. They can connect to your computer or mobile device via USB-C, USB-A and 3.5mm connectors.</p><p>The Zone True Wireless Earbuds will be available in two colors, graphite and rose, but won&#39;t come cheap at $299.

Back then, former AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson <a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_completes_acquisition_of_directv.html">said</a> combining DirecTV with AT&amp;T &quot;is all about giving customers more choices for great video entertainment integrated with mobile and high-speed internet service.&quot; According to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-08-02/directv-spinoff-att"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, AT&amp;T has lost 40 percent of the DirecTV&#39;s original subscriber number since then, and in the second quarter of 2021, DirecTV reported having 15.4 million premium video subscribers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The telecom giant has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-att-may-split-with-directv-satellite-unit.html">trying to offload</a> DirecTV since at least 2019, but it hasn&#39;t announced anything concrete until earlier this year. This deal doesn&#39;t include the HBO Max streaming service, which will be part of the company&#39;s separate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-spins-off-warner-media-in-a-merger-deal-with-discovery-123716979.html">WarnerMedia spinoff</a>. In May, AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">announced</a> a $43 billion deal that would see its WarnerMedia division merge with Discovery. It&#39;s expected to close in mid-2022, four years after AT&amp;T finalized its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Both that deal and this DirecTV spinoff will help AT&amp;T&#39;s debt reduction efforts. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/att-directv-spinoff-tpg-streaming-bundles-warnermedia-1234807615/"><em>Deadline</em></a> notes, it has taken several steps, including selling off assets, over the past few years to reduce the debts it has acquired due to its massive multimedia acquisitions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-direc-tv-spinoff-051610804.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a47458eb-8e13-4cd0-9b0e-04d172fa2804</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 05:31:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627966925</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T05:02:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f2612d70-f409-11eb-b7ff-2d09c60b5965" width="1200" height="794" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f2612d70-f409-11eb-b7ff-2d09c60b5965" width="1200" height="794" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon violated US labor laws in Alabama union vote, labor official rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) officer has recommended that workers at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama hold a new election because Amazon broke US labor laws, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/business/amazon-union-alabama-nlrb.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> has reported. It&#39;s still only a preliminary ruling, but provides hope that workers may still be able to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).</p><p>Last April, worker&#39;s at the fulfillment center <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">voted against</a> unionization by a margin of more than two to one. Following the vote, however, the RWDSU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-retail-union-rwdsu-23-objections-election-tampering-allegation-143104913.html">alleged</a> that Amazon won because it “interfered” with the rights of its employees &quot;to vote in a free and fair election; a right protected under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The RWDSU filed 23 objections in total, including one complaint that Amazon had a ballot collection box installed in an employee parking lot “without authorization” from the NLRB’s regional director. It noted that the box was placed under the view of Amazon security cameras, creating &quot;an impression of surveillance.&quot;</p><p>The NLRB officer sided with the union, saying Amazon violated US labor laws. &quot;Throughout the NLRB hearing, we heard compelling evidence how Amazon tried to illegally interfere with and intimidate workers as they sought to exercise their right to form a union,&quot; said union president Stuart Appelbaum in a statement. &quot;We support the hearing officer’s recommendation that the NLRB set aside the election results and direct a new election.&quot;</p><p>Amazon, however, said it would dispute the decision and take steps to ensure that the initial vote held. &quot;Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “Their voice should be heard above all else, and we plan to appeal to ensure that happens.”</p><p>The decision doesn&#39;t yet have any legal force until a full ruling is made by the NLRB&#39;s acting regional director, something that could take up to a month. During that time, parties will be able to file exceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Bessemer vote, Amazon&#39;s situation has caught the attention of the Teamsters union, which created a special division to focus on organizing Amazon&#39;s delivery drivers. Amazon has been criticized for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apologizes-for-tweets-attacking-work-conditions-192622311.html">working conditions</a> of drivers and warehouse workers alike, along with its union-busting efforts that were exposed in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-union-labor-relations-settlement-alabama-141059373.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> report earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-found-to-have-illegally-discouraged-union-organizing-in-alabama-035214235.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff73a7f4-df33-4f39-b2fd-01cc3683814a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 03:52:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627994242</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:37:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a7f1ea0-f457-11eb-b73b-11d09337941d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a7f1ea0-f457-11eb-b73b-11d09337941d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A worker pickets out front of an Amazon Fulfillment center.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1232002568 Amazon picket protest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter partners with Reuters and AP to boost curation efforts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter">partnering with <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em></a> to help its curation team put credible information in front of users. Made up of employees who work together to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-moments-guidelines-and-principles">contextualize some of the most popular topics</a> people are discussing on Twitter, the curation team oversees some of the platform’s more visible and sometimes controversial features, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-explains-trending-topics-pinned-tweets-173023064.html">Trends</a> and the Explore tab.</p><p>As a Twitter user, the company says you can expect to see it work faster to ensure there’s more and better contextual information to see as people discuss things on the service. As a starting point on that front, the company says Trends will include contextual descriptions and links to reporting from reputable publications more frequently. Additionally, the company says the program will help it proactively identify topics that could become a wellspring of misinformation. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter also expects the partnership will help some features, where context is vitally important, work better. Here, the company points to tools like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-misinformation-182940288.html">Birdwatch</a>. Initially, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> will focus on helping the company with English-language content, but it’s worth noting the curation team contextualizes Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese content as well.</p><p>In trying to support its curation team better, Twitter wants to avoid a repeat of a situation like the one it found itself in last year following the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The social media network was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/2/21413001/twitter-trends-labels-representative-tweets-conspiracies-misinformation">overrun with conspiracy theories about Epstein’s suicide</a>, and the company was seemingly unable to stop hashtags like #ClintonBodyCount from trending. Even when you take blatant disinformation out of the picture, Twitter trends are frequently easy bait for trolling, as was on display when US gymnast Simone Biles <a href="https://warzel.substack.com/p/the-simon-biles-culture-war-traveled">withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics</a>. While trolls are likely to continue trying to game the service, enlisting the help of <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> could make those efforts less visible</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-associated-press-reuters-curation-partnership-213918911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21e19397-6bc4-42de-918e-29a601821f1e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 21:39:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627940363</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T21:39:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Men are silhouetted against a video screen with a Twitter logo as he poses with a Samsung S4 smartphone in this photo illustration taken in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, August 14, 2013.

Spotted by <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-announces-smart-soap-dispenser-that-can-automatically-trigger-alexa-routines/"><em>AFTVnews</em></a>, the gadget includes a set of 10 LED lights that will count down as you wash your hands for the 20 seconds recommended by the CDC to keep germs and harmful bacteria away.</p><p>As an Alexa Gadget, you can also pair the Smart Soap Dispenser with a compatible Echo device to access a supporting Alexa Routine that will play your favorite song or tell you a joke or fun fact while you scrub away. That’s an optional feature and the dispenser itself doesn’t include a microphone or speaker. You also don’t need an Echo device to access its best gimmick. Depending on how far underneath the nozzle you hold your hand, the device will provide you with more or less soap from its 12-ounce reservoir. The closer you place your handle to the nozzle, the less soap it will dispense.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside of those features, the Smart Soap Dispenser comes with 802.11n WiFi connectivity like 2009 never came and went, and a micro-USB port (shudder) for when you need to charge the device. Amazon says the internal battery can last about three months on a single charge.</p><p>At $54.99, the Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is significantly more expensive than many of the “dumb” automatic soap dispensers you can buy, including a lot of the ones you’ll find on Amazon’s own marketplace. It also feels like it’s a year late. Many tech companies added hand washing-related <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wear-os-wash-hands-reminder-021849975.html">features last year</a>, and the latest science suggests the coronavirus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">rarely spreads on surfaces</a>. All the same, you can pre-order the Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser starting today, with orders expected to ship on August 4th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-smart-soap-dispenser-200025903.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">31f4ec8a-030d-4dee-b1e8-102ebc671236</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 20:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627937847</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T20:57:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8cf8efc0-f3ca-11eb-affd-501e01fb0a46" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8cf8efc0-f3ca-11eb-affd-501e01fb0a46" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Lord of the Rings series arrives on September 2, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lord%20of%20the%20rings">The Lord of the Rings</a> series has a release date, but don&#39;t go rushing to stake out the best spot in your living room just yet.

The Containment event features a new game mode called Nest Destruction, in which you&#39;ll attempt to destroy or defend an alien nest on a revamped version of the Consulate map.</p><div id="b686d1166d594773b949837aef139a95"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEhzh2YY8C8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The attackers play as a team of REACT agents who are tasked with destroying nests. They&#39;ll square off against &quot;a team of Proteans, a deadly Archæan variant that can adopt the form of REACT operators,&quot; Ubisoft said. These creatures can mimic the behavior of operators and they&#39;ll move fast, but they can only use melee attacks, such as Aruni’s punch and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/oryx"><ins>Oryx’s</ins></a> special abilities. The attacking team can only use a standard loadout with no modifiers, and there&#39;s a limited roster of operators. Along with successfully destroying or defending the nest, teams can win by wiping out their opponents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The event sounds intriguing, but the timing of it is slightly odd. The mode was inspired by <em>R6 Extraction,</em> which was supposed to arrive in September. Last month, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-extraction-riders-republic-172418599.html"><ins>pushed back</ins></a> the release date to January.

Between August 13th and 15th, <em>R6 Siege </em>will be free to play, so anyone can hop in and check out the event. Ubisoft will grant double bonus Battle Pass points during that weekend.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rainbow-six-siege-event-extraction-aliens-free-weekend-180523263.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a93d8e9a-d5e8-4d81-95fe-e0040e317f1a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 18:05:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627927527</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T18:05:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a6c2120-f3bb-11eb-beaf-b919fb1ece3c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a6c2120-f3bb-11eb-beaf-b919fb1ece3c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Containment event]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Containment event]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony adds 'Nier: Automata,' 'Ghostrunner' and 'Undertale' to PlayStation Now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony is adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-13-how-nier-was-brought-back-from-the-dead.html"><em><ins>Nier: Automata</ins></em></a>, <em>Ghostrunner</em> and <em>Undertale </em>to its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/02/playstation-now-games-for-august-nier-automata-ghostrunner-undertale/">PlayStation Now service</a>, the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/02/playstation-now-games-for-august-nier-automata-ghostrunner-undertale/"><ins>announced on Monday</ins></a>.

Even companies like Modal Electronics, which typically trafficked in higher-end instruments that started at around $2,000, suddenly felt pressure to compete in the sub-$300 range. First it dabbled with two simplistic DIY kits: the CraftSynth and CraftRhythms. But then in 2018 it brought the Skulpt to Kickstarter, followed shortly thereafter by the $149 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-modal-electronics-craftsynth-2-0-hands-on-demo-portable-music.html">CraftSynth 2.0</a>. These were much more serious shots at the entry level. But where both impressed with their sound, the build quality was poor and the original Skulpt was a little overpriced at $299.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-affordable-portable-synthesizer-mpe-100523052.html">SkulptSynth SE</a> attempts to address those concerns. It’s quite a bit cheaper at just <a href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">$199</a>, putting it more in line with the Volcas, and the build quality is sturdier, too. But under the hood it’s largely the same instrument, and the question is whether it’s as compelling now as it was three years ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alright, I won’t make you wait: The answer is yes. The Skulpt sounds great. Sure, plenty of other synths have come and gone over the last three years, especially at the cheaper end of the spectrum, but that doesn’t take away from the excellent virtual analog engine here. There’s a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices (though using the spread function you can expand that to 16) with two different waves per voice. This gives the Skulpt a thick tone that, while you probably won’t mistake it for true analog, is still plenty inviting. While it&#39;s perfectly capable of handling basslines and lead duty, the Skulpt really shines when it comes to pads where those stacked oscillators really flesh out the sound.</p><p>The Skulpt has a wealth of modulation options, too, that give it a surprising amount of depth for something so small and cheap. There are dedicated filter and amp envelopes, but also a mod envelope and a pair of LFOs, one of which is polyphonic. Those last three can be assigned to a host of different destinations, with a total of eight modulation slots available. In addition, there’s ring modulation, FM and pulse width modulation options, plus a morphing filter that goes from lowpass, to bandpass then highpass, not to mention built-in delay and distortion effects. There are far more sound design tools here than you’d have any right to expect for $200.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The wealth options are great, but actually navigating those controls is a bit difficult. The unit comes with a cheat sheet and you’ll always want it on hand. While the front plate has simpler, less confusing graphics than the original Skulpt, the SE still isn’t exactly intuitive. While there are lines that show you what controls are connected to each other, they’re not laid out in any sort of obviously logical way. And the tiny orange and white text labels feel crowded and hard to read at times. While the layout is visually interesting, it’s also infuriating. This a place where form clearly won out over function, and not for the better.</p><p>Another thing that’s improved on the SE is the build quality. But, just like the panel design, it’s not as huge an upgrade as you might hope. The knobs feel a little firmer and have slightly more resistance than on the Craft 2, but they’re still pretty wobbly and cheap. At least they don’t slide right off the encoders with a gentle tug, though.</p><div id="e32890c2287b4b83b55bc683b7b28c5e"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1098737245%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-B0LetHEZU7a&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-sound-samples/s-B0LetHEZU7a" title="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples</a></div></div><p>I’m not sure how much better the overall build is than the original Skulpt, and it’s only marginally better than the Craft 2. In general, the Skulpt SE still feels chintzy. But it does come with a cover that will help protect it in a bag, which is more than I can say for the Craft. Sadly, though, the touch keyboard is as bad as ever. It’s not always super responsive and the layout somehow manages to feel both cramped and sprawling all at the same time. Playing simple triads required an uncomfortable amount of stretching and I could rarely play a chord progression without accidentally triggering at least one stray note. Volca keyboards are certainly nothing to get excited about, but they make the Modal touchstrips feel like cheap imposters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db0a6f0-f3a4-11eb-9efc-9043541d6567" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="a5c9ec23-5bc7-38bd-a7d2-752d30e18809"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One final gripe about the physical design: The Skulpt has full-sized MIDI in and out ports, but a 3.5mm lineout jack. While full-size MIDI DINs are appreciated, I’d rather see ¼-inch audio outs and smaller TRS MIDI jacks if I had to choose. And honestly, on something that’s battery powered and portable, TRS MIDI just makes more sense. Save the space.</p><p>A lot of my complaints about the interface and unimpressive build quality can be ignored though if you just use the app. Stick the Skulpt someplace out of the way and connect it to your computer or phone over USB and you’re set. Then you can control it via MIDI over USB and do all your patching from within the Modal app. It’s much easier than using the device itself. It even has a VST version so you can control the Skulpt from your DAW, but I had some issues getting it running on my Windows PC.</p><section data-eng-breakout="19fd7110f0864e86ac1322de738befc1" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b027e4d0-f3a5-11eb-adfb-393619633cd2" alt="Modal App" data-uuid="04e7bad0-fb33-3f6c-9b6d-fc2a1a26c471"></section><p>The Skulpt is usable without the app, unlike the Craft 2. But honestly, this is probably the way you want to use the Skulpt anyway. While the whole battery-powered portable thing is nice, what’s more exciting is its support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mpe">MPE</a>, which is basically unheard of at this price point. But the built-in keys do not support MPE, velocity or aftertouch, you’ll need to use an external controller.</p><p>Having access to aftertouch and polyphonic expression gives the Skulpt much more life. As a digital synth trying to emulate analog it can sound a little cold at times, but the small fluctuations that come with aftertouch and MPE make the synth feel more organic. Just be warned that dialing in MPE controls requires a bit of trial and error (definitely turn down the pitch bend range in the settings).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daf9580-f3a4-11eb-a5f6-10c98ed41a79" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="37da4d89-4f42-3a2a-bbf8-1f822ecc40e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>This also gives you more room to experiment with your sound design in interesting ways. For example, in one patch I set the mod wheel (sliding your fingers along the Y axis on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-sensel-morph-trackpad-review.html">Sensel Morph</a>) to change the wave shape, and aftertouch to control the filter cutoff. Then I could play a chord and slowly slide my fingers up on the highernotes, causing them to fizzle out as the wave morphed from saw to noise, but keep the bass note droning cleanly. And then I could adjust the balance between these two sounds simply by pressing harder or softer on the right keys. This isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, but it’s definitely impressive on a synth that costs just $200.</p><p>This does make me dream of an upgraded CraftSynth, though. As much as I enjoy the Skulpt, I prefer the sonic palette of the wavetable-based Craft a bit more. I’d love to see Modal release a polyphonic version of it that supports MPE. Basically, give us the best of both synths in a single device.</p><section data-eng-breakout="11b589afc1914f54aaf0989fb5f6772a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daef940-f3a4-11eb-befc-05e1c86e1239" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="50503922-2ef0-3dbf-bd78-6049918c8dee"></section><p>There are so many options out there at the entry level for synths these days it’s hard to say there is one that is best for most people. The Skulpt SE certainly wouldn’t be a bad choice, though. If you’re truly just starting to learn synthesis, something more straightforward like the $150 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-11-korg-announces-volca-analog-synth-series-we-go-eyes-on.html">Volca Keys</a> might be a good option. But it doesn’t have the depth of the Skulpt. If you’re willing to spend a bit more, Arturia’s $350 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-v3-firmware-three-new-oscillators-noise-engineering-synthesizer-184459017.html">Microfreak</a> has even more sound design options to get lost in. Plus, it regularly gets new features and sounds. The only issue is it’s even more complicated than the Skulpt, though its controls are much easier to navigate.</p><p>The SkulptSynth SE shows that Modal is serious about playing at the entry level. The company has delivered an excellent sounding instrument with a wealth of features at an impressive price.
