While the official livestream won&#39;t get underway until 10AM ET, Engadget’s coverage of Unpacked will start at 9:40AM ET with a pre-show. We’ll also return after the event is complete to share analysis and answer your questions. Between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-august-2021-s-pen-foldables-galaxy-z-fold-3-z-flip-230006850.html">information shared by Samsung</a> and the usual assortment of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-unpacked-line-up-revealed-in-huge-new-leak-095533534.html">pre-release leaks</a>, we have a good idea of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-z-fold-3-z-flip-3-watch-active-4-buds-2-154226625.html">what to expect</a> from the company later today.</p><div id="1bde968e3af648e3bfb23edc6a96ae75"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF57V00Lu68?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>For instance, we’re almost certain Samsung won’t announce a new Note phone at Unpacked. Instead, updated models of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Galaxy Z Flip</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">Galaxy Z Fold</a> will headline the event. The company has also confirmed it will show off a new version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-august-2021-s-pen-foldables-galaxy-z-fold-3-z-flip-230006850.html">S Pen</a> that will work with its foldable devices. However, what we’re most excited about is the chance to see its latest Galaxy Watch wearable. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">At I/O 2021</a>, Samsung and Google announced they were working together on a new version of Wear OS, and we’ll see the fruits of that partnership at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wear-os-one-ui-watch-unpacked-2021-171520963.html">Unpacked</a>. Beyond that and an updated pair of Galaxy Buds, there’s always the chance Samsung could surprise us as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Follow all of the news from Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Unpacked event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy%20unpacked%20foldables"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-11-event-123001799.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7da6250-99ad-439a-b67e-a9d6c41e2c89</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 12:30:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628627914</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T20:38:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab1b0950-f9fd-11eb-abfd-566f1c2e2051" width="3000" height="1840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab1b0950-f9fd-11eb-abfd-566f1c2e2051" width="3000" height="1840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Fold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Fold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[1Password's latest major update is now available in early access on Macs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been more than three years since <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-23-1password-7-mac.html">last major update for Mac</a>. That’s not to say the company has been idle. Far from it, in fact, but macOS users haven’t had a significant refresh to look forward to until now. Following early access previews on <a href="https://blog.1password.com/welcoming-linux-to-the-1password-family/">Linux</a> and <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/">Windows</a>, you can now try <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-mac-is-now-in-early-access/">1Password 8</a>, the latest version of the company’s desktop app, on Mac. The update brings with it a host of improvements to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html">password manager</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first things you’ll notice is how categories have moved from the sidebar to a dropdown menu you can access from below the search bar. 1Password co-founder David Teare told Engadget that’s a decision the company made to highlight different accounts and vaults without forcing users to access a separate mode.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A goal the developer set out for itself when it started work on 1Password 8 was to make the app better at highlighting all the ways you can share different vaults and login credentials between family members and co-workers. You’ll see that approach reflected throughout the app, starting with when you first open it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b434e040-f9f5-11eb-9fed-a5ee7a3d0675" alt="1Password move item" data-uuid="942704d9-d47a-3944-865b-8ad4a5718ea7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>The lock screen now includes icons that display what accounts you will open. Moreover, once you’re in the main interface, you’ll see more contextual information throughout. For example, when you’re about to move a login, a pop-up window will appear to tell you who will gain access to that information as a result.</p><p>With the emphasis on sharing, 1Password is doubling down on paid memberships. While the writing has been on the wall for a while, 1Password 8 won&#39;t allow you to sync your accounts and vaults over Dropbox, iCloud or any other services aside from 1Password. According to Teare, the company decided to discontinue support for third-party syncing for a handful of reasons. “It’s hard to do sharing using a platform for syncing that doesn’t have a concept of other users,” he said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ddf6f80-f9f5-11eb-bfd7-fc5eab4510c0" alt="1Password 8 Watchtower dashboard" data-uuid="40f9e13c-787b-3e78-88b4-3fe8ac668d58"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>One of the other goals 1Password set for itself with this new app was to keep things familiar. However, there are areas where the company experimented. It’s most apparent in the new Watchtower view. That section of the software will still warn you if you have weak, reused and compromised passwords, but will do so using a new dashboard view that’s similar to how competitors like Dashlane and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-security-dashboard-dark-web-monitoring-130006738.html">LastPass</a> present the information in their products. Teare said 1Password debated making Watchtower the first screen you see after opening 1Password 8 but ultimately decided that was “too big of a jump for one release.” However, he noted the updated Watchtower represents a new direction for 1Password, one where the company has the capabilities to allow its designers to tweak things more freely.</p><p>In a way, that’s the unifying theme of 1Password 8. It’s a significant milestone for 1Password not because of the new features involved but due to the work the company did behind the scenes to put systems in place for future releases. “With 1Password 8, we really wanted to tie everything together,” Teare said. Previously, the company had separate teams working on its different apps, with little in the way of shared code and resources between them. To help them work together, 1Password built a common code base using Rust, a programming language Teare said allowed the company to create a more cohesive experience across its apps while still catering to what makes each operating system different.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8447e4e0-f9f5-11eb-9bf5-20531b856c92" alt="1Password safari inline" data-uuid="482d3317-b38f-33ed-be52-fe40e6ad5767"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>The way 1Password 8 works in conjunction with Safari is one example of that. You’ll now see the browser extension open inline with the username and password field on a website. If you have the app configured to handle two-factor authentication requests for you, it will also automatically fill that field once you get to it.</p><p>Once it&#39;s done testing the app, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> expects to release 1Password 8 for Mac and Windows later this year. According to Teare, the company also plans to bring the improved experience to Android, iPhone and iPad users &quot;in the near future.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e6da932-d8a1-42a5-addf-70e398ebb829</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 12:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628683611</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T12:07:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1aaa94f0-f9f6-11eb-9f73-13b7571066ca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1aaa94f0-f9f6-11eb-9f73-13b7571066ca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[1Password]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[1Password hero]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1Password hero]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods will link with an Apple ID in iOS 15 to enable Find My support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">iOS 15</a> will grant succor to all of those who have lost, and lamented, their AirPods.

Even if they’re not connected to your phone, you should still be able to find them on the map via the Find My network. Unfortunately, it does look that, despite being tied to your Apple ID, the relevant AirPods will not have an activation lock attached to them.

Notably, the patch that hides the camera has the same 400ppi density as the rest of the panel, albeit with smaller pixels and transparent circuitry. In-screen cameras usually offer sub-par photos and often stand out from the rest of the smartphone screen, due to reduced pixel density.

The update is designed to protect its users, particularly creators and public features, from seeing harassing, racist, homophobic and sexist content in comments and DM requests.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Limits feature, available starting today, will allow all users to hide comments and DM requests from users who either don&#39;t follow them or only recently started following them.  On top of that, the app will issue &quot;an even stronger warning&quot; and halt posting immediately if someone tries to publish an offensive content — rather than waiting for a repeat offense as before.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Creators also tell us they don’t want to switch off comments and messages completely; they still want to hear from their community and build those relationships,&quot; said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ways-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse">blog post</a>. &quot;Limits allows you to hear from your long-standing followers, while limiting contact from people who might only be coming to your account to target you.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram said that it developed the features following racist abuse directed at UK footballers in their direct messages. &quot;Our research shows that a lot of negativity towards public figures comes from people who don’t actually follow them, or who have only recently followed them, and who simply pile on in the moment,&quot; said Mosseri.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We saw this after the recent Euro 2020 final, which resulted in a significant — and unacceptable — spike in racist abuse towards players.</p></blockquote><p>The other new feature, Hidden Words, allows users to filter abusive messages in DM requests. If a request contains any filter word you&#39;ve chosen, it&#39;s automatically placed in a hidden folder that you can choose to never open — though it&#39;s not completely deleted.</p><p>The update, available starting today, arrives after Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html">announced</a> that it would make Instagram safer and more private for teens. Changes introduced last month include automatically making accounts private for teens under 16, limiting the ability of advertisers to target personal information like &quot;interests&quot; and using AI to detect a users&#39; age.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes also come as Facebook explores creating a version of Instagram for kids under 13.

With the touch of a button, the Audi Skysphere&#39;s entire front end can extend or retract 9.8-inches (and drop 0.4 inches).&nbsp;</p><p>The Skysphere is meant to show Audi&#39;s design chops as well as its technical prowess. It took inspiration from the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/1937-horch-853-wins-pebble-beach-concours-delegance-1783/">1931 Horch 853,</a> a long, low roadster with a pushed-back cabin and rear-wheel drive. The modern concept retains those primary features, in spades, with the long snout and low, laid-back cockpit giving it a mild resemblance to rear-drive GTs like the Ferrari 812 Superfast.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6dd1d4f0-fa5e-11eb-8fdb-617f0ff4f04c" alt="Audi&#39;s Skysphere concept EV roadster can transform into a grand tourer" data-uuid="e7914322-53f0-37c2-903c-7167e9403d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><p>In place of the straight-8 gas guzzler on the Horch, the concept car has a 623-horsepower electric motor and an 80-kWh battery, with much of it behind the rear bulkhead. That makes for a Porsche 911-like rear weight bias of 60-40, meaning it would be easy to get the Skysphere sideways if it was ever built. It also delivers 553 foot-pounds of torque, enough to take it to 60 MPH in around 4 seconds. At the same time, it will go around 310 miles on the Euro WLPT cycle, or less in EPA terms.&nbsp;</p><p>The interior is meant to evoke 1930s Art Deco architecture (matching the period of the Horch), with modern electronic conveniences. It has a full dashboard screen like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-honda-e-first-drive.html">Honda E</a>, along with large touchscreens at the armrest locations. The sharply angled, minimalist interior is designed for a Level 4 autonomous operation, so you can relax in GT mode and take control when you want to have some roadster-powered fun.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/91490be0-fa60-11eb-bdb7-501418ca5815" alt="Audi Skysphere" data-uuid="165bb2f1-aa61-3976-b485-fbe6330e2d2c"><figcaption>Roadster sport mode</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3a17740-fa60-11eb-bf7f-8e3e44f07deb" alt="Audi Skysphere" data-uuid="2a9ad6d9-e0cd-319d-806c-a0fefb95b532"><figcaption>Grander tourer (GT) mode</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><p>The most unique (though perhaps highly unrealistic) feature of the Skysphere is the variable wheelbase (above). Electric motors drive a telescoping structure that takes it from a long-wheelbase grand touring EV to a considerably shorter and lower roadster.

The company removed 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts associated with a campaign, which also recruited unwitting influencers to boost its message.</p><p>According to Facebook, the network “originated in Russia,” but was linked to Fazze, a subsidiary of a UK-registered marketing firm that operates from Russia. The accounts primarily targeted India and Latin America, though the United States was also targeted “to a much lesser extent.” The campaign came in “two distinct waves,” according to Facebook.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“First, in November and December 2020, the network posted memes and comments claiming that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine would turn people into chimpanzees,” the company wrote in a report. “Five months later, in May 2021, it questioned the safety of the Pfizer vaccine by posting an allegedly hacked and leaked AstraZeneca document.” Facebook didn’t speculate on who hired Fazze or what their motive was, but Ben Nimmo, the company’s Global Threat Intelligence Lead for Influence Operations, noted that the activity “coincided roughly with times when regulators and some of the target countries were discussing emergency authorization for each vaccine.”</p><p>Ultimately, the campaign was “sloppy” with “quite low” engagement, according to Nimmo. The exception was the paid posts from legitimate influencers who got caught up in the campaign, as those posts “attracted some limited attention.” However, it was influencers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/business/pfizer-vaccine-disinformation-influeners.html">who exposed</a> the campaign, after a handful publicly disclosed that Fazze had offered to pay them to “claim that Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine is deadly,” according to <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>While Facebook regularly publishes details around inauthentic behavior and foreign interference on its platform, this is one of the first that centered around COVID-19 vaccines. The topic has become a thorny issue for Facebook, as officials have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">blamed social media</a> for not doing enough to prevent vaccine disinformation from spreading.</p><p>In a call with reporters, Facebook’s Head of Security Policy, Nathaniel Gleicher. said that the effort, though unsuccessful, highlights how disinformation campaigns <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-report-state-of-influence-operations-110051516.html">are evolving</a>. “Influence operations increasingly span many platforms and target influential voices because running successful campaigns with large numbers of fake accounts on a single network has become harder and harder,” he said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-caught-a-marketing-firm-paying-influencers-to-criticize-covid-19-vaccines-181030579.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb7e7723-1364-45b2-8ea8-3f7c1c555f1e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 18:10:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628622432</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T19:07:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/057cf3e0-9d33-11eb-bf9b-3b99c35b300e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/057cf3e0-9d33-11eb-bf9b-3b99c35b300e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 13, 2021 (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[App Photo Illustrations]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyundai's Motional will start testing its robotaxi in Los Angeles this month]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/motional"><ins>Motional</ins></a>, a joint autonomous vehicle venture between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/aptiv"><ins>Aptiv</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hyundai"><ins>Hyundai</ins></a>, is expanding its operations in California.

It may not be the most high-powered Chromebook out there, but it has essential features that most users need at a price well under $500. At launch, the Flex 5 came in at $430, but it often went on sale and could be found for $330 on rare occasions. But Amazon has it for even less right now — only $310 — which is $120 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310" href="https://amzn.to/3xvrtNX">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you get to the $300 mark in the Chromebook space, you&#39;re often asked to sacrifice when it comes to power. That&#39;s not the case with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review-170023587.html">Flex 5</a> — it runs on a 10th-gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Those specs should be more than enough for most people, especially considering a majority of Chromebook work will be done in a browser. We found the Flex 5 was more than capable of running numerous Chrome tabs at once with few hiccups. We also appreciated its ability to do so for at least eight hours before needing to be recharged.</p><p>When it comes to design, the Flex 5 doesn&#39;t take too many risks and that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not the slimmest or the lightest laptop, but at 0.66-inches thick and three pounds, it won&#39;t be hard to shuffle from room to room in your home or tote with you to school. It&#39;s also a convertible, which gives you more flexibility in how you use it. The 13-inch 1080p touchscreen will serve most people well, be it for work or entertainment purposes, and we especially liked its backlight keyboard.</p><p>Overall, it&#39;s hard to find a Chromebook that ticks so many boxes at this price point. Sure, Lenovo made some sacrifices when it comes to RAM and storage capacity, but those are to be expected when you&#39;re looking at sub-$500 Chromebooks. The Flex 5 combines a solid 2-in-1 design with a good amount of power at a wallet-friendly price point, and that&#39;s more than we can say for other Chromebooks coming in at $300.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-deal-310-amazon-135551711.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75c7733-dda9-47cd-a4f9-cd651db8fc28</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628605893</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T14:31:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xiaomi's Mi Mix 4 packs an under-screen camera in a ceramic body]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just days after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html">Oppo</a> unveiled its latest under-screen camera solution, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Xiaomi</a> is now launching a new flagship phone with a similar, if not the same, feature. The Mi Mix 4 is the Chinese company&#39;s slimmest ceramic unibody smartphone yet, featuring a 6.67-inch 2,400 x 1,080 screen that stealthily hides a 20-megapixel selfie camera underneath a near-indistinguishable patch of pixels — it&#39;s the same 400ppi density as the rest of the panel, albeit with smaller pixels and transparent circuitry thanks to advancements in AMOLED production.</p><p>If the selfie photos on the Mi Mix 4 turn out to be just as good, if not better, than Oppo&#39;s samples from last week, then it&#39;s no surprise that Xiaomi went with this under-screen camera tech. The Mix series has always been about pushing the boundary of form factor design, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix.html">first</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-xiaomi-mi-mix-2-ceramic-unibody-price.html">two</a> models — both designed by Philippe Starck — offering super slim screen bezels along three sides. They were some of the first ceramic smartphones, too.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix-3-slider-hands-on.html">Mi Mix 3</a>, Xiaomi finally got rid of the chin by moving the selfie camera to a slide-up module. I wasn&#39;t a fan of that design, though, as it felt more fragile.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a31d1130-f9da-11eb-befd-dbdcfab3877c" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4" data-uuid="fc37a598-9bdd-3f22-9b98-954c312b6d7b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Now that the under-screen camera is seemingly reaching maturity, it serves as a sensible evolution path to the Mi Mix 4. Still, CEO Lei Jun added that if you really care about your selfies, you should stick to phones with punch-hole cameras; but for him, the under-screen camera is good enough.</p><p>The screen itself is otherwise very much the same as what many other recent flagships are offering: 10-bit color, P3 gamut, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, 120Hz refresh rate and 480Hz touch sampling rate. It&#39;s protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus. Like many recent Xiaomi phones, the Mi Mix 4 provides stereo sound tuned by Harman/Kardon, which should go well with that vibrant screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e8ef87c0-f9de-11eb-8dff-b48a3049e120" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 heat sink" data-uuid="1a7aad1c-17c6-3e77-9e59-9efb2d7a579c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Mi Mix 4 also happens to be the first smartphone sporting Qualcomm&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G processor, taking the clock speed up to 3GHz while being cooled by several layers of graphene and graphite. LPDDR5 RAM options range from 8GB to 12GB, whereas UFS 3.1 storage goes from 128GB to 512GB.</p><p>Much like the iPhone 12 series, the Mi Mix 4 also packs UWB (ultra-wide band), but instead of tracking tags, Xiaomi is using this for a feature dubbed &quot;Point to Connect.&quot; Simply point your Mi Mix 4 to a compatible Xiaomi smart device like a TV, smart speaker (like the freshly-announced Xiaomi Sound) or air conditioner, and the relevant app will show up.&nbsp;</p><p>The company will also offer a small UWB hub for existing TVs, and this will launch via a beta program in China on August 20th.

The findings show that algorithms can &quot;amplify real-world biases&quot; and conventional beauty expectations, Twitter said.</p><p>This wasn&#39;t the only issue. Halt AI <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1424819782763745282">learned</a> that Twitter&#39;s saliency algorithm &quot;perpetuated marginalization&quot; by cropping out the elderly and people with disabilities. Researcher Roya Pakzad, meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1424819783736860672">found</a> that the saliency algorithm prefers cropping Latin writing over Arabic. Another researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1424819784672190464">spotted</a> a bias toward light-skinned emojis, while an anonymous contributor found that almost-invisible pixels could manipulate the algorithm&#39;s preferences</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1424819786798669824">published</a> the code for winning entries.</p><p>The company didn&#39;t say how soon it might address algorithmic bias. However, this comes as part of a mounting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-17-snapchat-dysmorphia-selfies-plastic-surgery-social-media.html">backlash to beauty filters</a> over their tendency to create or reinforce unrealistic standards. Google, for instance, turned off automatic selfie retouching on Pixel phones and stopped referring to the processes as beauty filters. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Twitter&#39;s algorithm took a more neutral stance on content in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ai-bias-beauty-filters-133210055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b094bc08-b952-4538-9e79-696343fb4463</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:32:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628602332</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T13:32:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea9ee970-eb0c-11eb-bff7-edec61e3c4f2" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea9ee970-eb0c-11eb-bff7-edec61e3c4f2" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/06/08: In this photo illustration a Twitter logo is seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.
