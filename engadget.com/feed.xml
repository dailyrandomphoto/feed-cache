However, it&#39;s normal price of $230 isn&#39;t exactly cheap — but now you can get the smart lock for the best price we&#39;ve seen by going to Wellbots. The online retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:4th-generation WiFi smart lock" href="https://fave.co/2PQ2RzI">4th-generation WiFi smart lock</a> for $179 when you use the coupon code <strong>ENGADGET20</strong> at checkout.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2PQ2RzI" id="5301e0581feb4f3cbbc6bb60c8f6bb1d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy August WiFi smart lock at Wellbots - $179</a><p>August didn&#39;t fix what wasn&#39;t broken about its smart lock, but it did take the time to add features that make the 4th-generation feel like a substantial upgrade. It&#39;s half the size of the previous generation lock and it no longer requires a bridge thanks to its WiFi connectivity. Installation is pretty quick and easy, thanks in part to the helpful video instructions in the August mobile app, and we appreciate that the company forces you to turn on two-factor authentication during setup. It&#39;s an extra security measure that&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re talking about a device that lets people into your home. In addition to two-factor authentication, the lock also uses Bluetooth encryption, AES 128-bit and TLS encryption.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once installed, the mobile app can act as your digital keys, remotely locking and unlocking your door at any time. This makes it easy to let a friend or family member into your home when necessary even if you&#39;re away. You also don&#39;t have to forsake your physical keys all together — you can still use them to unlock your door at any time, so even if you forget to replace the smart lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries, you&#39;ll still be able to get into your home.

Since its launch with a dozen indie publishers in the Spring, the premium option has been activated on 100 podcasts, according to the Sweden-based streaming service. On September 15th, subscriber-only content will be made available to international listeners. While overseas creators will have to wait a tad bit longer to get their hands on the monetization tools.</p><p>The program itself is available through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-anchor-podcast-playlist-format-133051601.html">Anchor</a>, the podcast creation platform Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-06-spotify-gimlet-anchor-podcast-profitable.html">acquired</a> alongside podcast network Gimlet for just shy of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">$340 million</a> in 2019. The company has billed the service as a win-win for its entire user base, giving publishers the chance to reap subscription fees with no commission (for the first two years) from avid listeners. Spotify will start taking a cut of 5 percent in 2023. Comparatively, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcast-subscriptions-172016084.html">Apple charges a $20 annual fee</a> for its program and takes a 30 percent cut of subscriptions for the first year and 15 percent thereafter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on learnings from its test period, Spotify is introducing 20 new pricing options for podcasts to offer creators more flexibility.

Not only will this help you better organize your library, the system will automatically generate personalized lists based on the movies you own. You should now see a My Lists tab next to My Movies.</p><p>Organizing a Movies Anywhere library presents a different challenge to grouping titles together on the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/prime%20video">Amazon Prime Video</a>. While subscribers of those services have access to the same content based on the country they&#39;re in, every Movies Anywhere user has a unique selection of films in their locker.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Movies Anywhere is looking to avoid having the same movie in too many lists. As such, movies are typically funneled into categories to which they&#39;re most closely matched.</p><p>One key part of the My Lists feature is that it takes into account viewing behavior. During a demo last week, Movies Anywhere didn’t go into too much detail about how this works. However, if you watch a few minutes of any film, the algorithm, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems will consider what you&#39;re interested in watching when they organize your lists.</p><p>Movies Anywhere’s content team classifies the films and there are around 2,000 different potential categories as things stand. These are centered around things like genres, franchises, people (say, actors, directors or composers) and themes. So, if you have a lot of movies about robots or cyborgs in your library, they might be grouped together in a list. Same thing goes for a collection of Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Other lists might focus on movies focused on antiheroes or musicians. The system might generate a list of nostalgic flicks, or classify films into subgenres.</p><p>Lists that Movies Anywhere creates for you are marked as &quot;automatic lists.&quot; You can also create and modify lists. You&#39;ll be able to add and remove films, reorganize lists and rename them. If you own all the Star Wars movies, for instance, you can place them in release order, sort them in the canonical timeline or even arrange them in the so-called <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/features/star-wars-movies-series-may-the-fourth-list-machete-order-sequence-rise-of-skywalker-clone-wars-last-jedi-2222667">Machete order</a>. It’s up to you.</p><p>One thing you can&#39;t do right now is modify any lists on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-samsung-smart-tvs-202921681.html">Movies Anywhere smart TV app</a>. You can only browse your lists there. But because your lists sync across devices, you can make changes on a phone, tablet or computer, and you&#39;ll see those reflected on your smart TV.</p><p>This is a useful update, especially for Movies Anywhere users who pick up a ton of movies during sales or those who redeem tons of digital codes from Blu-ray purchases. The service says that My Lists is &quot;a direct response to specific requests&quot; from users. It should bring some more order to users&#39; libraries, which can get unwieldy as they grow in size.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-my-lists-feature-ai-machine-learning-130038870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3eac470d-c270-46e9-a176-09b2b1a5d6e0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629811761</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T13:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a600040-04df-11ec-b9d3-bceb6f6a0076" width="3232" height="2046" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a600040-04df-11ec-b9d3-bceb6f6a0076" width="3232" height="2046" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Movies Anywhere My Lists section.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Movies Anywhere My List]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yamaha's $500 wireless ANC headphones pack 3D sound and head tracking tech]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yamaha is releasing high-end headphones with adaptive audio tech and an eye-catching design to help them stand out in a crowded marketplace. The $499.95 <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-l700a/index.html">YH-L700A</a> are the latest over-ears to join the exclusive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-quantum-gaming-headphones-speaker.html">head tracking</a> audio club. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-27-dolby-dimension-wireless-headphones-review.html">Dolby Dimension</a> before them, Yamaha says its new headphones can identify where sound is coming from and re-orientate what you hear on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>Working in tandem with the 3D audio, the tech aims to deliver an immersive experience that lets you track individual sounds. It all sounds similar to Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tvos-spatial-audio-181110124.html">Spatial Audio</a> or Samsung&#39;s rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review-163027027.html">360 Audio</a>. Yamaha&#39;s feature is called &quot;3D Sound Field&quot; and essentially leans upon its Cinema DSP processing to convert stereo sound into multi-channel audio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc1556f0-04c8-11ec-b7ff-8ffa523f4953" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A" data-uuid="8d89f7d6-8360-36a2-8e25-0aafc885239e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yamaha</div></figure><p>Overall, the headphones tick a number of boxes. There&#39;s &quot;advanced&quot; active noise cancelation (ANC) that can be switched on and off. Here, the system uses an algorithm and internal mics to adaptively remove ambient noise from the playback music signal.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, there are a range of audio modes that you can enable via an accompanying mobile app, which (along with the advanced ANC) are also available on the $350 <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-e700a/index.html">YH-E700A</a> headphones. They include a &quot;listening optimizer&quot; that can adjust the sound based on how you wear the headphones; &quot;listening care&quot; that promises a fuller range of audio at lower volumes; and &quot;ambient sound&quot; that uses the mics to capture external sounds and present them in the background of your audio. Yamaha claims you&#39;ll get an ambitious 34 hours of listening time per charge, though the jury&#39;s out on whether that will withstand rigorous testing.</p><p>While they retain some features from Yamaha&#39;s other headphones, they don&#39;t look like the company&#39;s prior efforts. Yamaha has switched from round to rectangular earcups that can swivel and fold. Like the headband, they&#39;re covered in a foamy fabric. The new headphones are out now at select retailers and on the <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-l700a/index.html">Yamaha store</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-anc-headphones-130036800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30d6a7f4-6af0-48b5-977e-ed5efcb3b807</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629818818</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T15:27:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3fbb69e0-04c8-11ec-b2fe-c1b102980892" width="1280" height="854" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3fbb69e0-04c8-11ec-b2fe-c1b102980892" width="1280" height="854" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yamaha]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peloton's newer, safer Tread will be available to buy on August 30th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-plus-tread-plus-123651887.html">Peloton introduced its new lower-cost Peloton Tread</a> to the market, which was around $1,800 cheaper than the original Tread+ ($4,295). It was then sold for a short period of time in the UK, Canada and the US, where it had a limited invitation-only release. Then the company had to halt sales of the Tread and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-recall-cpsc-safety-us-canada-154309695.html">recall both its connected treadmills</a> after reports of several injuries and one fatality. The Tread in particular had to be recalled because its touchscreen console could detach and fall. The issues have since been fixed, but the incident obviously delayed the broader release of the Tread.</p><p>Now, the company is ready for a redo of sorts with a much wider launch. Peloton announced today that the newer, safer Tread will be available in the US, Canada and the UK on August 30th, while those in Germany will have to wait until later this fall. The Peloton Tread is priced at $2,495 USD ($3,295 CAD / £2,295 / €2495).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a reminder, the Tread includes many of the same features of the Tread+, albeit in a more affordable package. It has a 23.8-inch HD touchscreen instead of the 32-inch on the Tread+, and it uses a traditional running belt instead of a shock-absorbing slat belt. The Tread also has a slightly smaller footprint; it’s 68 by 33 inches, rather than 72.5 by 36.5 inches.</p><p>Peloton also emphasized software and hardware safety features in the new Tread, which helps address the recall concerns. One of them is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-treadmill-owners-will-be-able-to-run-again-without-a-paid-subscription-065018321.html">Tread Lock</a>, a mandatory four-digit digital passcode. Tread Lock will be available for both All-Access members as well as those without. There’s also a physical safety key that a runner can pull to quickly stop during a class.</p><p>Additionally, as you&#39;d expect, Peloton said that all Treads from here on out will have the improved hardware and software installed. That means that the touchscreen console is now securely attached to the Tread at all times, according to the company.

On Monday, Poly Network, a cryptocurrency finance platform, was hacked by “Mr. White Hat” who exploited a vulnerability in its code to steal $610 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies. The company now says it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-161726337.html">recovered all the money it lost in the theft.</a></p><p>Less than a day after stealing the digital currencies, the hacker started returning millions saying they were “ready to surrender.” They subsequently locked more than $200 million in assets in an account that required passwords from both them and Poly Network. They said they would only provide their password once everyone was “ready.” At that point, Poly Network offered the hacker a $500,000 reward — a fraction of what they had stolen.</p><p>It’s not entirely clear why the hacker surrendered, but it may have been difficult to cash out the millions. The hacker says they were trying to contribute to the security of Poly Network. Maybe they just didn’t want to get caught. Poly will breathe a sigh of relief as will those that were doing their crypto trading through the platform.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-mouse-windows-10-security-vulnerabliity-141732431.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">A Razer mouse can bypass Windows security just by being plugged in</a></h2><h3>The company says it&#39;s fixing the flaw.</h3><h3></h3><p>Security researcher Jon Hat posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/j0nh4t/status/1429049506021138437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1429049506021138437%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Frazer-mouse-windows-10-security-vulnerabliity-141732431.html">Twitter</a> that after plugging in a Razer mouse or dongle, Windows Update will download the Razer installer executable and run it with SYSTEM privileges.

Like with any of the social network&#39;s experiments, it will only be available to a limited number of accounts. But those who do get access to the test will be able to call friends on the platform without having to fire up the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>As the publication notes, this looks like a move Facebook is exploring to further streamline its services that include Messenger, which became a separate app in 2014, and WhatsApp. Connor Hayes, director of product management at Messenger, told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it&#39;s meant to reduce the need to jump back and forth between the company&#39;s main app and its Messenger service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook already has plans to unify its messaging apps. In September 2020, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chat-across-instagram-and-messenger-120049504.html">enabled the ability</a> to chat and send messages between Instagram and Messenger, and the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-30-facebook-will-let-users-chat-across-messenger-instagram-and-wha.html">previously said</a> that WhatsApp would also get inter-app messaging capabilities. The company tested putting a simpler version of Messenger within the main app last year, as well. That&#39;s something the social network been considering since at least 2019 when Jane Manchun Wong found an experimental feature that takes users straight to a &quot;Chats&quot; section when they tap on the messaging icon. Currently, doing so automatically opens the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>Hayes told the publication that Facebook now considers Messenger as a service instead of a standalone app. We may see more of its technologies across the company&#39;s other apps in the future — in fact, Instagram, Oculus and Portal devices already use Messenger&#39;s technology for voice and video calls. &quot;You’re going to start to see quite a bit more of this over time,&quot; he said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-test-voice-video-calls-main-app-101603664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1a0cf5d-d2aa-420b-9707-dc8ce49b0ed3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 10:16:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629800174</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T10:16:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[May 26, 2019 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters located in Silicon Valley (1 Hacker Way);]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oculus update lets Quest headsets auto-sync VR media to mobile]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Oculus">Oculus</a> is rolling out an update to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-oculus-quest-pro-vr-headset-164646103.html">Quest</a> VR headsets that includes several tweaks and improvements.

The video game giant has announced that it&#39;s making a Patents Pledge, which gives rival developers free access to any of its accessibility-related technologies. While not all gameplay mechanics are patented, some companies have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/patents-on-video-game-mechanics-may-strangle-innovation/">taken to</a> making sure competitors aren&#39;t legally allowed to use their technologies. Critics condemn the practice, <a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/the-orcish-patent-how-do-video-game-patents-work-and-should-you-be-protecting-your-ideas/">accusing</a> the companies of stifling creativity and innovation in the industry. EA at least won&#39;t be suing anybody that incorporate its accessibility features in their games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-31-gaming-irl-apex-legends.html">Apex Legends&#39;</a> &quot;ping&quot; system.</p><p>The feature gives players in the same team a way to communicate with each other without using voice chat. They can simply tap buttons to tell their teammates where they are on a map, to alert others of a threat or to tag targets. Supposedly, Epic Games borrowed <em>Apex&#39;s</em> ping system for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-28-fornite-season-eight-apex-legends-sea-of-thieves-theme.html"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. The Patents Pledge also covers at least four more EA features, three of which make video games more accessible to players with vision issues. Those technologies, already in use in the <em>Madden NFL</em> and <em>FIFA</em> franchises, can automatically detect colors and then modify their brightness and contrast to make them more visible.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last patent in the five EA specifically mentioned covers a technology allowing players with hearing issues to modify or create their own music. EA says it will add any future accessibility patents to the pledge and that it hopes the move can &quot;encourage others to build new features that make video games more inclusive.&quot;</p><p>Chris Bruzzo, EA&#39;s EVP of Positive Play, Commercial and Marketing, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At Electronic Arts, our mission is to inspire the world to play. We can only make that a reality if our video games are accessible to all players. Our accessibility team has long been committed to breaking down barriers within our video games, but we realize that to drive meaningful change, we need to work together as an industry to do better for our players.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first. We welcome collaboration with others on how we move the industry forward together.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ea-patents-pledge-accessibility-070041114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e1badee-113e-480e-b823-f45cfe026e00</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 07:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629788282</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T06:58:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c03b1a20-04a0-11ec-bfec-c97d5123a528" width="1454" height="818" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c03b1a20-04a0-11ec-bfec-c97d5123a528" width="1454" height="818" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apex Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apex Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX has already shipped 100,000 Starlink satellite internet terminals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html">Starlink</a> has already shipped 100,000 satellite internet terminals before it has even achieved global coverage.

The terminal itself isn&#39;t included in the monthly fee: Starlink sells its starter kit with the user terminal or antenna dish, its stand and power supply, as well as a WiFi router for an additional $499, which customers will have to pay up front. You can see what the terminal looks like in the image above, showing a dish installed on the roof of a school in Chile.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Starlink was designed to serve customers in remote locations where internet options are typically limited or even non-existent. Perhaps that&#39;s why customers are willing to pay the rather steep upfront cost. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/elon-musk-spacex-has-shipped-100000-starlink-terminals.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the company reported having 90,000 users in July, indicating that it signed up 10,000 more customers within just a few weeks.</p><p>The service uses thousands of small satellites in orbit to provide internet connection to its customers. SpaceX already deployed almost 1,800 satellites for the Starlink constellation, but it has plans to launch up to 42,000 small internet satellites in the future. Company president Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">previously said</a> that Starlink will be able to offer continuous global coverage once all the deployed satellites reach their operational orbit, which could happen as soon as September.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">959284fd-12c1-4ccf-926e-b25ef0535c53</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 05:18:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629782303</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T05:18:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b992cf80-0494-11ec-bfef-80438b1ca9c0" width="2970" height="1980" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b992cf80-0494-11ec-bfef-80438b1ca9c0" width="2970" height="1980" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PABLO COZZAGLIO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[View of an antenna of the Starlink satellite internet at the Jhon F.

In hopes of making those more useful for everyone, Google plans to make <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html">two tweaks to the Play Store</a>.</p><p>Starting in November, the ratings you see will be based on where you live. So, for example, if your device is registered to Japan, you will first see what other Japanese users think of the app you’re about to download. Then, sometime early next year, Google plans to further tweak Play Store ratings to better reflect the device you’re using, be that a phone, tablet, foldable, Chromebook or smartwatch. “This will give users a better impression of the experience that they can expect for the device they’re using,” the company says of the change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In part, Google is making these tweaks to help developers. It wants to avoid a situation where ratings in one area impact the global perception of an app. This can happen in cases where a bug only affects one localized version of the software. Of course, that compartmentalization means you can learn of those same bugs before you download an app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-rating-223423562.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45c38c94-0a31-4718-a370-5eadf7107947</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 22:34:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629758068</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T22:34:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c51ab9b0-045f-11ec-b7eb-786b6b7a5312" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c51ab9b0-045f-11ec-b7eb-786b6b7a5312" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Play Store ratings]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Play Store ratings]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teardown shows the Playdate won’t suffer from controller drift like the Switch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Panic&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-preview-170047433.html">pint-sized Playdate handheld</a> won&#39;t make its way to early adopters until the end of the year, iFixit got a chance to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Playdate+Teardown/143811?vgo_ee=xKmL%2BGmGXT5ug3Fpl2XHLRCU%2BQ9q5um3eYXtRi1pJDQ%3D">look inside the device</a> early. &quot;Unfortunately it didn&#39;t come with any games, so a teardown was about all it was good for,&quot; iFixit said, for those who might be jealous the company got a unit before they did.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a6ffca90-0457-11ec-9f76-309695a17f2e" alt="Playdate teardown" data-uuid="a80d7d73-69b2-3982-9114-f4a83fd247ab"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure><p>Taking apart the handheld, iFixit found a console with mostly modest internal components. The Playdate has a 180MHz CPU supported by 16MB of memory and 4GB of flash storage. Powering everything is a 2.74 Wh battery with about 25 percent of the capacity of the power cell you&#39;ll find inside the iPhone 12.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But what you want to know about is Playdate&#39;s signature fold-out crank. According to iFixit, Panic and Teenage Engineering embedded a cylindrical magnet into the shaft of the component. That magnet works in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect">Hull effect</a> sensor to trigger an input from the crank. It&#39;s a simple but effective design that should last. &quot;One thing this crank won&#39;t do? Drift. There&#39;s no wiper or spring or sensor surface to wear out,&quot; the company says, referencing the Nintendo Switch&#39;s well-known controller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-president-apologizes-joy-con-drift-161644217.html">issue</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b4391b30-0457-11ec-bfff-6be19a058495" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="85ebabf7-881b-3927-9117-c1e918279e6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure><p>While it&#39;s no <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-modular-repairable-swappable-right-to-repair-150022495.html">Framework laptop</a>, it&#39;s clear Panic and Teenage Engineering designed the Playdate with at least one eye toward repairability. A charming sticker iFixit found upon opening the device said &quot;breaking,&quot; not removing, the components would void the warranty. Many of the internals most likely to fail first, including the battery and headphone jack, were either modular or easily accessible. Components like the display and USB-C port will be more challenging to replace, but the Playdate looks DIY friendly enough that it could enjoy a <a href="https://www.retromodding.com/collections/game-boy-advance">modding scene like the Game Boy Advance</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/playdate-ifixit-teardown-212829159.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48ecd182-b084-45e6-a823-cfd3a37098d8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 21:28:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629755024</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T21:43:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65a794b0-0457-11ec-9dfb-212bcefdd6a9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65a794b0-0457-11ec-9dfb-212bcefdd6a9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iFixit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Playdate teardown]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Playdate teardown]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple employees are organizing to push for 'real change' at the company]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of current and former Apple employees are calling on their colleagues to publicly share stories of discrimination, harassment and retaliation they experienced while working at the company.

Before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twelve-minutes-cast-daisy-ridley-james-mcavoy-191952478.html">gained an all-star cast</a> including Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy and Willem Dafoe, it was an intriguing indie point-and-click adventure with a Groundhog&#39;s Day-esque time loop and a unique, top-down perspective. Its interactive narrative, combined with a wealth of cinematic influences, made it seem as if developer Luis Antonio was crafting something meant just for me.</p><p>That&#39;s pretty much how I felt at the beginning of the game. You play as a man who comes home to a small apartment. Your wife has some special news, which you celebrate over a romantic dinner. All of a sudden, a cop starts pounding on the door and accuses her of murder. Things go downhill fast, and in an instant you&#39;re right back to the beginning of the night. Your mission: Figure out what the hell is happening.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0d6446c6482a408d8891f65e0f13afa2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uob80LBVgzA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Sounds like a solid thriller, right? But after spending six hours with the game, I was furious. What started out as a fun mystery devolved into a repetitive slog. I was forced to abuse my seemingly lovely wife. Sometimes I had to watch her be repeatedly tortured by that sadistic cop. And I became a murderer myself, several times over. Making things even worse, my reward for that hellish journey was an array of twists so convoluted, so mind-numbingly <em>dumb</em>, I was angry about it for days. Say what you will about the works of M. Night Shyamalan, but at least his twists feel original. (And yes, I know those twists occur less often than you may think.)</p><p>I won&#39;t spoil where <em>Twelve Minutes</em> ultimately goes. And, to be honest, I&#39;m hesitant to even point out that a story has twists at all. But for a mystery like this, I figure that&#39;s to be expected. All of this time looping detective work just has to lead to something truly dramatic! And it&#39;s clear that Luis Antonio genuinely wants to blow your mind. It&#39;s just a shame almost everything falls flat at the end.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say <em>Twelve Minutes</em> isn&#39;t worth playing. The game&#39;s early hours set up a fascinating mystery box. Your small apartment has a cramped kitchen and living space, a bathroom, a bathroom and a closet. That&#39;s it. Everything you need to complete the game is there (or gets there later). Some of those puzzle pieces feel organic, like the mugs that you can fill with water, or the large knife tempting you in the kitchen. Some of them, like the light switch that can electrocute people on cue, are hilariously convenient.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d6e036d1a5e446f7a62a31d9bc3567f9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2324c80-0448-11ec-acba-508673d807a5" alt="Twelve Minutes"></section><p>I realized <em>Twelve Minutes</em> was doing something special early on when it managed to work its way into my subconscious. I thought of new things to try during long walks and after sleeping on a particularly annoying problem. That&#39;s a sign that, for a while at least, I was genuinely invested in the story. It helps that <em>Twelve Minutes </em>also has some solid voice work, which goes a long way toward connecting you to the characters. You don&#39;t get a full look at anyone&#39;s face (even if you try to scope out the cop through your front door&#39;s peephole), so it&#39;s nice to have some human performances grounding the story. If you’ve got Xbox Game Pass, it’s worth checking out the game just to experience its first few hours.</p><p>After the novelty wears off, though, the game quickly takes a turn for the worse. Eventually, you&#39;ll have to complete a long series of tasks over and over until you figure out your next step. And sometimes that can mean doing the same five tasks dozens of times. <em>Twelve Minutes</em> gives you a few easy ways to speed things up, like a single dialog option that can prove you&#39;re actually going through a time loop and that she&#39;s genuinely in danger. But a few more narrative shortcuts would make the game&#39;s rough last act more tolerable.</p><p>One major moment gives you only a few seconds to show one character a specific item. It&#39;s easy to miss that&#39;s something you can even do. And even when I <em>knew</em> what I had to do, after looking up a few guides, I still failed to trigger the right interaction several times. At that point, the game began to feel less like a puzzle I needed to solve and more like a <em>Saw</em> trap that I needed to escape from.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b22ddfb0-0448-11ec-bcde-748f758bb26b" alt="Twelve Minutes" data-uuid="5df6e309-561c-3b55-9a33-53ffba2f763a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>I suppose these issues could be overlooked if <em>Twelve Minutes</em> had a better script, but even in that respect it fails. It&#39;s stronger toward the beginning, but like a J.J. Abrams story, it has no clear idea where to go at the end. Characters start to act in completely different ways, which is hard to swallow after seeing them in one light for several hours. A sympathetic turn for Dafoe&#39;s cop feels particularly out of place, after seeing multiple loops where he kills you and your wife, and that’s even <em>after </em>getting the MacGuffin he&#39;s looking for. You don&#39;t need to have an ACAB tattoo to call him a monster.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t write off <em>Twelve Minutes</em> as a bad game, but based on where the story goes, it’s ultimately disappointing. Luis Antonio and his team spent over seven years working on the game, and it&#39;s a shame to see my enthusiasm for it fall apart in six hours.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twelve-minutes-review-game-200045769.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6e1dc40-7d9a-4fb0-ae09-723769734ca0</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629816497</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T14:48:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2275000-0448-11ec-ae7b-1592bff081c5" width="1849" height="986" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2275000-0448-11ec-ae7b-1592bff081c5" width="1849" height="986" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twelve Minutes]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twelve Minutes]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku revives former Quibi original 'Most Dangerous Game' for a second season]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Roku released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-adds-more-quibi-shows-to-original-144530038.html">last of the TV shows</a> and movies it acquired when Quibi shut down at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-shut-down-155124687.html">end of 2020</a>.

What makes this unit unique is that it was commissioned by Game &amp; Watch creator Gunpei Yokoi after Nintendo sold more than 20,000 million units of the handheld.

Part of that could be the result of the Game &amp; Watch market. As <em>Ars Technica</em> points out, you can find common versions of the handheld for about $50. Rarer variants like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSJ33UpFrs&amp;ab_channel=BalloonFightWiki">Ballon Fight</a> one can go for as much as $2,000 if they’re in good condition.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/commemorative-game-and-watch-auction-sale-174356767.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf23becf-7a56-4ec4-8ad8-6f6837bf04ce</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:43:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629740640</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T17:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5bfdeb90-0438-11ec-8ebf-b6ece5500ae1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5bfdeb90-0438-11ec-8ebf-b6ece5500ae1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Beforemario]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Game & Watch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Game & Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data leak exposed 38 million records, including COVID-19 vaccination statuses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around 38 million records from north of a thousand web apps that use Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-first-gpt-3-feature-coding-business-apps-122557556.html">Power Apps portals platform</a> were left exposed online, according to researchers. The records are said to have included data from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19">COVID-19</a> contact tracing efforts, vaccine registrations and employee databases, such as home addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers and vaccination status.</p><p>Data from some large companies and institutions was exposed in the incident, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed/#"><em>Wired</em></a><em>,</em> including American Airlines, Ford, the <a href="https://events.in.gov/event/state_notifying_hoosiers_about_improper_access_of_contact_tracing_information">Indiana Department of Health</a> and New York City public schools. The vulnerability has mostly been resolved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers from security company Upguard started looking into the issue in May. They found data from many Power Apps portals that was supposed to be private was available for anyone to access if they knew where to look.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power Apps service</a> aims to make it easy for customers to make their own web and mobile apps. It offers application programming interfaces (APIs) for developers to use with the data they collect. However, Upguard found that using those APIs makes the data obtained through Power Apps Portals public by default, and manual reconfiguration was required to keep the information private.</p><p>Upguard <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps">says</a> it sent a vulnerability report to the Microsoft Security Resource Center on June 24th, including links to Power Apps portals accounts on which sensitive data was exposed and steps to identify APIs that enabled anonymous access to data. Researchers worked with Microsoft to clarify how to reproduce the issue. However, an Microsoft analyst told the firm on June 29th that the case was closed and they “determined that this behavior is considered to be by design.”</p><p>Upguard then started notifying some of the affected companies and organizations, which moved to lock down their data. It raised an abuse report with Microsoft on July 15th. By July 19th, the company says that most of the data from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/overview">Power Apps portals</a> in question, including the most sensitive information, had been made private.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft provided us with the following statement after this story was first published: &quot;<em>Our products provide customers flexibility and privacy features to design scalable solutions that meet a wide variety of needs. We take security and privacy seriously, and we encourage our customers to use best practices when configuring products in ways that best meet their privacy needs.&quot;</em></p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/important-changes-deprecations#table-permission-changes-for-forms-and-lists-on-new-portals">said</a> Power Apps portals apps will keep data private by default when developers harness the APIs. In addition, it released <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/admin/portal-checker-analysis">a tool</a> for developers to check their settings.</p><p>There&#39;s no indication as yet that any of the exposed data has been compromised. Among the most sensitive information that was left in the open were 332,000 email addresses and Microsoft employee IDs that are used for payroll, according to Upguard. The company also says that more than 39,000 records from portals related to Microsoft Mixed Reality were exposed, including users&#39; names and email addresses.</p><p>The incident underscores the fact that a misconfiguration, no matter how seemingly minor, could lead to serious data breaches. That doesn&#39;t appear to be the case here, thankfully. Still, it goes to show that developers should probably triple check their settings, especially when plugging in an API they haven&#39;t designed themselves.</p><p><strong>Update 8/23 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added a statement from Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Update 8/23 4:30PM ET:</strong> Clarified that the issue concerned Power Apps portals, and not Power Apps as a whole.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c324299-0375-4afb-a07d-6062c8e522ce</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:54:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629750927</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T20:35:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01cf42d0-0439-11ec-8f3d-30c7cc737ca4" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01cf42d0-0439-11ec-8f3d-30c7cc737ca4" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images/iStockphoto]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Broken red lock security concept on a wall with blue padlocks in a row composed of a rectangle pattern]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Broken lock security concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Poly Network says it has recovered all $610 million it lost in cryptocurrency heist]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most unusual cryptocurrency heists in recent memory has come to a close. On Monday, Poly Network, a decentralized finance platform that saw a hacker named “Mr. White Hat” exploit a vulnerability in its code to steal $610 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies, says it has recovered all the money it lost in the theft.</p><div id="e21ebc98bef94178b80e331b96b72995"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear &quot;Hacker&quot;, <br><br>Thank You!

Poly Network is now working to return control of those digital currencies to their rightful owners, a process the company says it hopes to complete as soon as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Poly Network hack took one strange turn after another. Less than a day after stealing the digital currencies, the hacker started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-cryptocurrency-heist-returned-funds-133025946.html">returning millions</a> and sent a token indicating they were “ready to surrender.” Everything was going smoothly until they locked more than $200 million in assets in an account that required passwords from both them and Poly Network. They said they would only provide their password once everyone was “ready.” At that point, Poly Network offered the hacker a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-rewards-crypto-hacker-121507483.html">$500,000 reward</a>.</p><p>It’s unclear why the perpetrator had a change of heart, though some experts believe they may have found it difficult to launder and cash out the money they had on their hands. All we have to go on from the hacker is that they were trying to help in their own way.</p><p>“My actions, which may be considered weird, are my efforts to contribute to the security of the Poly project in my personal style,” the hacker said in a message they included with the final transaction, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/poly-network-hacker-returns-remaining-cryptocurrency.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “The consensus was reached in a painful and obscure way, but it works.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-161726337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b2dc59c-f2f1-4fae-bdbb-4f64620e1842</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:17:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629735450</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T16:17:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e7b0e60-fbb1-11eb-93bf-1d759aacf88d" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e7b0e60-fbb1-11eb-93bf-1d759aacf88d" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Poly Network logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in Sulkowice, Poland on August 12, 2021.
