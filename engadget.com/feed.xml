Would it?</p><p>Very clearly, the VideoMic Go II was designed to sit atop a camera. That’s just a fact, but with USB and 3.5mm outputs and compatibility with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-connect-podcasting-app-000034018.html">Rode Connect</a> – the company’s USB-friendly podcasting app – it turns out this lightweight, $99 mic could be more versatile than it first seems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you <em>are</em> looking for a mic for your DSLR, know that the VideoMic Go II has a cold shoe mount, the aforementioned 3.5mm out (which can also be used for monitoring) and it comes bundled with a Rycote shock mount and a windscreen in the box. There’s no secondary/safety/stereo recording here or on-mic gain control, but that’s normal for something in this price range.</p><p>Performance-wise, the sound is surprisingly rich for a mic of this size without sounding too “dead.” There’s no notable difference between the audio you get out of the USB port compared to the 3.5mm port bar a little variation in gain. When comparing it against Rode’s VideoMic Me and VideoMic NTG, the VideoMic Go II might well be my favorite of the bunch. It’s natural, focused with just the right amount of ambiance/sense of space.</p><p>Where the VideoMic Go II gets more interesting is how it performs in <em>other</em> use cases. When plugged into a computer and placed on a desk the VideoMic Go II sounds just as robust as far more expensive dynamic microphones. So much so it threw me for a moment.</p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this is when I tested it against the $400 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">Shure SM7B</a> and Rode’s own $99 NT USB Mini. Given that both of the Rodes in this test are condenser microphones and cost about the same, you might think those two would be the nearer match, but it turns out that the VideoMic Go II sounded <em>much</em> closer to the SM7B. This isn’t to say it’s as good as the SM7B (there’s a little more depth in the Shure and a touch more dynamic range perhaps) but given the disparity in price, it definitely wasn’t expected.</p><p>This similarity is further compounded when you consider that the different type of capsule – Rode’s condenser versus Shure’s dynamic – alone would typically give them a very different sound. You can hear all three microphones in the sample below. It starts with the Shure, then the VideoMic Go II and then the NT Mini. The transition between the first two is subtle, yet the last one is obvious. Oh, and the VideoMic Go II was about two inches further away from my mouth than the SM7B was.</p><div id="3a616b0aa8e14bbeb2a3a29b0803f3b3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:400px;position:relative;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0FsbAY7" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><p>Of course, this is just one test, in one scenario in one specific room. But for a quick comparison of what a $400 mic can do off the cuff compared to a $99 one, it’s a good starting point. Despite the lack of on-device controls, there are some configurable options via Rode Central. When connected to the app (mobile or desktop) you’ll have the option to tweak the gain level, apply a high pass filter / high-frequency boost and adjust the monitoring volume. It’s less convenient than physical on-mic controls, but still allows you some control over how it sounds or responds to different inputs. (If you&#39;re wondering, the audio above starts with the SM7B and switches to the VideoMic Go II at &quot;two condenser microphones&quot;).</p><p>Given that Rode added compatibility for Connect, and the USB option makes it phone and tablet-friendly, suddenly the VideoMic Go II could very well be a good all-rounder for the price. A mic that has video chops but can also do double duty as a podcast mic (and, therefore an all-purpose computer mic) there appears to be a lot of bang for the veritable buck.</p><p>Of course, if you really do need something that records a safety channel, has physical variable gain controls or if XLR connectivity is a must, this isn’t the one to go for. But for most general creator uses? It finally might not entirely “depend on what you’re recording.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rode-video-mic-go-ii-230059221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c854d539-d36a-4adc-9d4f-cb7a68e3f8bc</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 23:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641832508</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T16:35:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II - a new versatile shotgun microphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surgeons successfully transplant genetically modified pig heart into human patient]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a desperate effort to save the life of a 57-year-old man, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have accomplished a medical first. Per <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-heart-transplant-6651614cb9d73bada8eea2ecb6449aef?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a>, this past Friday, surgeons successfully transplanted a pig heart into a patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><p>In doing so, they showed a genetically modified animal organ could survive and function within the human body without immediate rejection. Three days after the procedure, David Bennett, the individual who underwent the surgery, is alive and “doing well,” according to the hospital.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Food and Drug Administration authorized the procedure on compassionate grounds. Bennett was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant and had run out of other options. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” he said in a statement before doctors operated on him.</p><p>Scientists have tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-25-transplant-organs-from-human-pig-hybrids.html">save humans with animal organs</a> for decades. One of the most notable attempts occurred in 1984 when doctors grafted a baboon heart into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Fae"><ins>Stephanie Fae Beauclair</ins></a>, an infant born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The congenital disorder left her body incapable of circulating blood properly. Baby Fae, as she was better known, survived for 21 days before her body eventually rejected the transplanted organ.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, what makes this latest procedure different is doctors used a heart that had been genetically modified to remove four genes that encode a molecule that causes the body to reject the orphan organ. They also inserted six human genes to make the immune system more tolerable of the foreign tissue. Whether the experiment represents a breakthrough will depend on what happens next. Bennett’s body could still reject the pig heart. For the moment, however, he’s alive, and doctors are understandably excited about what this could mean for patients.</p><p>“If this works, there will be an endless supply of these organs for patients who are suffering,” Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s xenotransplantation program, told <em>The Associated Press</em>. That would be a dramatic change from the status quo. According to the <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics"><ins>Health Resources and Services Administration</ins></a>, more than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 17 individuals die every day waiting for an organ transplant.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d986fd5-07f6-4b25-b6e9-3af10ae57eef</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:46:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641854809</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T22:46:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tests & Procedures]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/740d3a10-7265-11ec-bdd6-7a20f2bea132" width="5040" height="3346" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/740d3a10-7265-11ec-bdd6-7a20f2bea132" width="5040" height="3346" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thierry Dosogne via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surgeons team operating heart]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[surgeons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer reneges on its claim the Zephyr mask uses 'N95-grade' filters]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Razer has removed any mention of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-hazel-razer-zephyr-201208975.html">Zephyr</a> and recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-zephyr-pro-announcement-180037042.html">Zephyr Pro</a> smart face masks including “N95-grade” filters from its website and other marketing materials. “The wearable by itself is not a medical device nor certified as an N95 mask,” a Razer spokesperson told Engadget. “To avoid any confusion, we are in the process of removing all references to ‘N95 Grade Filter’ from our marketing material.”</p><div id="ff06b3d3ced04acd9224c9fcf3c658c3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve taken feedback and guidance from regulatory agencies to establish our testing protocols for the Razer Zephyr and Razer Zephyr Pro.

The 3D-printed attachment snaps onto the left thumbstick. When it&#39;s placed on a surface (or one&#39;s thigh), physically moving the entire controller will move the thumbstick.

In a video, Kuumeri demonstrates the ability to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>, a co-op-only game, solo by using attachments on two controllers.

All the main characters from the original return, including Uncle Phil and Carlton, though they may not be like you remember them. That&#39;s most apparent with Carlton who comes off as bashful in the trailer. Thankfully, at least Will&#39;s best friend Jazz looks true to his inspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="8c487c8fec594b94a0b691f5f72420d3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-_P9DPMuy8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The project was inspired by a fan film writer and director Morgan Cooper released in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA&amp;ab_channel=SunSquaredMedia">2019</a>. Both Cooper’s creation and the Peacock series lean into the original premise of <em>The Fresh Prince</em>, using Will’s journey from West Philidelphia to Bel-Air to tell a story about second chances, race and class. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnr0QwHVJpg&amp;ab_channel=WillSmith">Will Smith’s Westbrook Studios</a> produced the series, with Cooper serving as director, co-writer and executive producer. He told Smith in 2019 the idea for <em>Bel-Air</em> came to him while driving down Interstate 71. He was thinking about the original show when he drove an underpass and inspiration hit. &quot;I knew I had a story to tell,&quot; he said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Peacock" href="https://fave.co/3GfSbzg">Peacock</a> will release the first three episodes of Bel-Air on Super Bowl Sunday, with subsequent episodes to follow weekly.

Honor says you can fully charge the battery in 40 minutes or to 50 percent of its capacity in just 15 minutes.</p><p>The phone has five cameras in total.

At 293g, the silver and black models weigh slightly more than the 288g orange variant. The Magic V will only be available in China at the outset. The 256GB model costs ¥9,999 (approximately $1,568) while the 512GB version is ¥10,999 (around $1,725). The Magic V will go on sale on January 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-v-foldable-smartphone-153214121.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2edaca1a-5999-4657-9019-555c96559da9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:32:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641829919</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T15:52:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTags are cheaper than usual in Woot's latest one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AirTags are some of the most affordable Apple gadgets you can get, which is probably why deep discounts on them are hard to come by. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html">Last week</a>, we saw one of the trackers drop to $24 and a four-pack fall to $96 on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3qdSW6p">Amazon</a>, but Woot&#39;s latest flash sale makes the bundle even cheaper.

The 13-inch laptop with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $150 off right now, bringing it down to $1,150. Only the space gray model has this discount right now, but the silver version is $100 off and down to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$1,199" href="https://amzn.to/3qbWTZi">$1,199</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/334Nk5A" id="a1e8c4797c0445f386e120220cb18bf0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Pro M1 at Amazon - $1,150</a><p>Keep in mind that this is the 2020 model — not the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2021 MacBook Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3zHNPyd">2021 MacBook Pro</a>, which features an updated design with more ports and Apple&#39;s higher-end M1 Pro or M1 Max chipsets. That&#39;s not to say the 2020 model doesn&#39;t have its merits. In fact, it earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">score of 84</a> from us when we first reviewed it thanks to its speedy performance, fast GPU, lovely display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad plus its long, 16.5-hour battery life. And since the Pro is unlike the Air and has a fan inside, it can handle sustained workloads like video encoding better.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few downsides to the Pro M1, namely its support for only one external display and lack of external GPU support all together. And, when compared to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">2021 models</a>, the port selection is lacking. The 2020 laptop only has four Thunderbolt ports, whereas you&#39;ll get connectors like an HDMI port, an SD card slot and more on the newer machine. However, those updated MacBook Pros start at $1,999, so this sale on the 2020 MacBook Pro is a good option for those who have a tighter budget but still want an upgraded laptop and feel comfortable skipping the extra ports.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2020-macbook-pro-m1-is-150-off-at-amazon-134059747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">174574bc-1977-47e1-a66b-41e87d0c3b8a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:40:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641822060</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:41:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take-Two is acquiring mobile game giant Zynga for $12.7 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PC gaming Giant Take-Two has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220110005389/en/Take-Two-and-Zynga-to-Combine-Bringing-Together-Best-in-Class-Intellectual-Properties-and-a-Market-Leading-Diversified-Mobile-Publishing-Platform-to-Enhance-Positioning-as-a-Global-Leader-in-Interactive-Entertainment">announced</a> that it&#39;s making a big move into mobile gaming with the acquisition of Zynga for a total price of approximately $12.7 billion. Take-Two already owns Rockstar Games, Codemasters and 2K, producing games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, <em>Bioshock</em> and others.

The deal will also help Take-Two save about $100 million annually after two years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zynga itself was on an acquisition streak of late, having acquired the studio behind <em>Torchlight 3</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zynga-echtra-games-185252730.html">early last year</a>. Zynga has sometimes relied on acquisitions to find the hottest games in the notoriously fickle mobile gaming market. Still, Take-Two said that the mobile industry booked $136 billion 2021 and is currently growing at over 8 percent, so the money is there to be had. Mobile will now account for half of its net bookings (net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically), the company said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/take-two-is-acquiring-mobile-game-giant-zynga-131758269.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a891ca4-ce25-4c66-a824-d8237a713b6f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:17:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820701</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:18:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Zynga logo is pictured at the company's headquarters in San Francisco, California April 23, 2014.

Now, astronomers have <a href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/dying-star/">captured</a> a red supergiant before, during and after a supernova explosion for the first time, gathering <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3f3a#apjac3f3af1">crucial new information</a> about these dramatic events.</p><p>&quot;This is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,&quot; said lead author Wynn Jacobson-Galán (UC Berkeley). &quot;Direct detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova.

Later in the fall when it went supernova, the team captured the powerful flash using the Hawai&#39;i-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-31-keck-observatory-exoplanet-imager.html">Keck Observatory</a>&#39;s Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS). They also captured the very first spectrum of the supernova, known as SN 2020tlf.</p><p>The observations showed that the star likely ejected massive amounts of dense circumstellar material just ahead of the explosion. Previous observations showed that red giants were relatively calm before going supernova, so the new data suggests that some may change their internal structure significantly before exploding. That could then result in tumultuous gas ejections moments before collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>SN 2020tlf is located in the NGC 5731 galaxy about 120 million light-years from Earth and was about 10 times more massive than the Sun. Stars go supernova when they run out of fuel and collapse on their own gravity, fueling a massive carbon fusion explosion. For that to happen, they must be large enough (8 to 15 solar masses) or they&#39;ll simply collapse into white dwarf star like our Sun eventually will. Any larger than that and they could collapse into a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-19-black-hole-image-jean-pierre-luminet.html">black hole</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The discovery will now allow scientists to survey red supergiant stars looking for similar types of luminous radiation that could signal another supernova. &quot;Detecting more events like SN 2020tlf will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution... in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives,&quot; said Jacobson-Galán.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scientists-see-a-red-giant-star-go-supernova-for-the-first-time-104442583.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c7b9d3b-a6d4-4899-90c2-e075f4f7ebc2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 10:44:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820635</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:17:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/89cb2950-7217-11ec-bfff-4c9e0dc2a850" width="2300" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/89cb2950-7217-11ec-bfff-4c9e0dc2a850" width="2300" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Keck Observatory]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Scientists see a red giant star go supernova for the first time.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Red giant star supernova]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla 'Full Self-Driving' beta features an 'Assertive' mode with rolling stops]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Profiles are back in Tesla&#39;s latest &quot;Full Self-Driving&quot; beta 10.3 with an &quot;Assertive Mode&quot; that may perform rolling stops and other borderline maneuvers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22875382/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-assertive-profile"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers have <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-first-fully-3d-printed-flexible-oled-display">developed</a> what they say is the first fully 3D-printed flexible OLED display. In theory, you wouldn&#39;t have to depend on panels made at large, distant factories to build or repair your gadgets.</p><p>The new approach combines two methods of 3D printing to print the six layers needed for a functional display. The team used extrusion printing to make the electrodes, encapsulation, insulation and interconnects, while active layers were spray-painted at room temperature. Past attempts by various teams either had issues with light uniformity (consistency across the whole panel) or relied on techniques beyond 3D printing to put some components in place, such as spin-coating or thermal evaporation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prototype was just 1.5 inches wide and used just 64 pixels. Any practical uses would require much higher resolutions (a 1080p display requires over 2 million pixels), and the scientists also want to improve brightness. It might also take a while to adapt the technology for home use. The university used a custom 3D printer that costs as much as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">Tesla Model S</a> — it might take a while for the method to be viable on off-the-shelf printers, even including high-end models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formlabs-3plus-3bplus-new-esd-resin-170038287.html">FormLabs&#39; $4,850 3B+</a>.</p><p>The very nature of the technology makes those goals relatively achievable, though, and opens the door to numerous possibilities if and when home-printed OLED displays are practical. On top of do-it-yourself repairs, this could help you build homebrew gadgets with custom screens. While this effort doesn&#39;t quite represent the democratization of tech manufacturing (there are many more parts than displays, after all), it could reduce your dependence on companies&#39; pre-assembled components.</p><div id="1fd9e8d06c8c457394ecbc16f94205a2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7KV_lOIp8o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/full-3d-printed-flexible-oled-display-220930099.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecd6166a-2589-49c0-a3d7-614ad2845580</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 22:09:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820311</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8b3ff7d0-718f-11ec-9a3f-84ee75f2f933" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8b3ff7d0-718f-11ec-9a3f-84ee75f2f933" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[McAlpine Group, University of Minnesota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D-printed flexible OLED display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[3D-printed flexible OLED display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roblox halts service in China ahead of a major revamp]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roblox may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-british-fashion-council-is-giving-an-award-for-the-best-roblox-design-132423514.html">enjoying success</a> in many parts of the world, but it&#39;s currently in limbo in China. <em>TechCrunch</em>  has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/">learned</a> Roblox temporarily shut down the Chinese version of its game platform, LuoBuLeSi, on December 8th for some &quot;important transitory actions&quot; needed to develop a future version.

China&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-passes-personal-information-protection-law-182326563.html">data protection rules</a> could also have contributed to the decision by dictating where and how Roblox stores users&#39; information.</p><p>Whatever the reasons, the temporary halt underscores the difficulties foreign game developers have in China.

According to the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple has rejected the idea of a metaverse (in this case, an all-virtual world) for its long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vr-ar-headset-rumors-141606384.html">mixed reality headset</a>. The very idea is &quot;off limits,&quot; Gurman&#39;s sources claimed. The focus would be on short stints of communication, content viewing and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-vr-games-160752822.html">gaming</a>.</p><p>Past rumors have hinted headset could debut as soon as this year, although its specs and target audience aren&#39;t certain. Early scoops suggested it might have a resolution of 8K per eye, over a dozen &quot;inside out&quot; tracking cameras and a developer focus that included a $3,000 price. Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested the headset would &#39;only&#39; use 4K displays and six to eight cameras, however, hinting at a more affordable device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the claim is true, Apple&#39;s approach to mixed reality would be very different than that of its rival Meta. Where Meta has shifted its AR and VR strategies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html">toward the metaverse</a>, Apple appears determined to avoid  it. Whether or not that strategy could work is another matter. Apple&#39;s reported strategy could pay off if metaverses struggle, and might thwart Meta&#39;s plans by limiting overall interest in virtual worlds. If metaverses do succeed, though, Apple could miss out and find itself supporting others&#39; VR environments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-no-metaverse-for-vr-headset-182544991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c052dd2-fc2f-43f7-be6d-d460b1480bc4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 18:25:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641753226</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T18:33:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Apple employee helps a member of the media try on an HTC Vive while testing the virtual reality capabilities of the new iMac during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Josh Edelson        (Photo credit should read JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-APPLE-DEVELOPERS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK watchdog to grill Meta over child safety in VR]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is facing more scrutiny over its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democratic-lawmakers-cancel-instagram-kids-184621575.html">approach to child safety</a>. The UK&#39;s Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) told <em>The Guardian</em> in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/09/uk-data-watchdog-seeks-talks-with-meta-over-child-protection-concerns">statement</a> that it was planning &quot;further discussions&quot; with Meta about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a> VR headset&#39;s compliance with a recently established children&#39;s code that priorities the &quot;best interests&quot; of young users. The watchdog wants to determine whether Meta&#39;s headset and VR services do enough to protect the privacy and data of kids.</p><p>Baroness Beeban Kidron, who developed the code, was concerned Meta&#39;s platform made it too easy for kids to sign on and risk abuse, harassment and explicit content. Meta might require a Facebook account (and thus that a user be at least 13 years old), but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s implementing the code&#39;s required age checks. Children can jump into potentially dangerous VR chatrooms just by &quot;ticking a box&quot; to say they&#39;re old enough, Kidron said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Meta spokesperson told <em>The Guardian</em> the internet giant was &quot;committed&quot; to honoring the children&#39;s code, and was &quot;confident&quot; its VR hardware met the code&#39;s requirements. The representative stressed that terms of service don&#39;t allow children under 13 to use the products, but didn&#39;t address worries it was too easy for kids to ignore that policy. The firm has already promised a $50 million program to make sure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> development obeyed laws and regulations.</p><p>The UK could deliver a wide range of punishments if the ICO finds Meta violated the code. While officials might do little more than issue a warning, they could also fine Meta either a fixed amount up to £17.5 million (about $23.8 million) or as much as 4 percent of its worldwide turnover — over $10 billion. There&#39;s at least some pressure on Meta to toughen child safety in VR, even if it&#39;s just to protect the company&#39;s finances.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-watchdog-meta-vr-child-safety-165358686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28da1309-e716-4f5e-b436-ade8ef8b1185</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 16:53:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641747239</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T16:54:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly unveil an iPhone SE with 5G this spring]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple might use its now-customary spring event to update its most affordable smartphone. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> that Apple is expected to introduce a third-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-review-2020-cheap-a13-bionic-399-130014174.html">iPhone SE</a> this spring through a virtual presentation &quot;likely&quot; happening in March or April. In an echo of past rumors, Gurman understood the new SE would still cling to the iPhone 8-era design but add 5G and a new processor — possibly the A15 from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>, if Apple&#39;s history of using last year&#39;s high-end chip is any indication.</p><p>There was no mention of other changes. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Apple increased the storage to 128GB or updated the camera sensors (again borrowed from the iPhone 8), but those aren&#39;t guaranteed given Apple&#39;s low-cost focus for the iPhone SE. A larger battery might be necessary to compensate for 5G&#39;s typically higher energy drain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the leak is accurate, the new iPhone SE would be disappointing for those wanting a modern nearly-all-screen design. You&#39;d still have a relatively small screen, thick bezels and a button-based fingerprint reader. As we just mentioned, though, price is everything for the SE. The current model&#39;s $399 price helps Apple reach some customers who otherwise couldn&#39;t justify an iPhone. The company might not want to do anything that could prompt even a small a price hike, if just to maximize the SE&#39;s potential audience.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">309de2bc-5e0a-4a4e-bb8c-fd13fda84276</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 15:13:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641741233</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T15:14:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mars Perseverance halts rock sample storage due to debris]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html">Mars Perseverance rover&#39;s sample collection</a> has run into a snag.

All the same, this illustrates the challenges of the mission — even a seemingly pedestrian task as storing a sample can go awry in the wrong conditions. And when Mars is so distant, fixes aren&#39;t necessarily easy or certain.</p><div id="24d349d976984fc98919cc9fd9aa7fab"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I recently captured my sixth rock core and have encountered a new challenge.

The agency has successfully deployed the JWST&#39;s signature gold-coated primary mirror, completing all major deployments for the instrument.

It&#39;s not clear how close this will hew to the original graphic novels, but creator Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley and 2010 movie director Edgar Wright will be executive producers.</p><p>O&#39;Malley will serve as a showrunner alongside <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> reviver BenDavid Grabinski.

Both the graphic novels and the movie were nods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">manga</a>, indie rock, video games and turn-of-the-millennium Canadian culture.</p><p>This is a slightly unusual twist on a familiar formula. While Netflix hasn&#39;t been shy about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html">ambitious anime plans</a>, it has typically focused on originals or adaptations of Japanese <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-anime-014631924.html">games</a> and manga. Here, the streaming service is adapting a comic that was a Western tribute — and one that many might only know from the big screen. Netflix&#39;s strategy isn&#39;t clear, but it might see this as a way to expose its anime catalog to a larger audience.</p><div id="84f53c74819444f8804382789016c155"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb3TWNzMSr0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scott-pilgrim-netflix-anime-series-173848944.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">402f1643-751d-4922-bee5-7c21a05e718a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:38:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641663529</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T17:39:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bryan Lee O'Malley/Oni Press]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google and Ford want to bring small radar to more devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Radar might soon find its way into more personal technology than Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">phones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">smart speakers</a>. <em>9to5Google</em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/06/google-soli-radar-ripple/">notes</a> Google, Ford and four other partners have <a href="https://cta.tech/ripple">published</a> specs for a Ripple standard that could bring small radar to more devices in a &quot;privacy-respecting&quot; fashion.

In a <a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward">post</a> by company CEO Ben Bear, he said Spin has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872768/ford-e-scooter-company-spin-pulling-out-cities-limit-competition-open-vendor">winding down</a> its operations in a few markets in the US, as well as in the entirety of Germany and Portugal. The company will also shut down its operations in Spain, which could happen sometime in February 22nd.</p><p>Open permit markets are places where multiple scooter companies can run businesses, with no caps on fleet sizes. Bear said they &quot;create an uncertain operating environment&quot; with &quot;race to the bottom pricing.&quot; It doesn&#39;t sound like Spin has been doing well in those markets — Bear wrote that Spin hasn&#39;t been able to offer &quot;the type of reliable high quality service [it] prides [itself] on to its riders and city partners&quot; in those locations — so it has decided to take another path instead.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ford-spin-redesigned-electric-scooter.html">expanded</a> its operations after it was acquired by Ford to a bunch of cities in the US and around the world.
