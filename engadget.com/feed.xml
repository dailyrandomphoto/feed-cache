The company has used it to unify the look and feel of its apps and services across various platforms. According to Verkoeyen, Google shifted its open source iOS Material component libraries into maintenance mode earlier this year after it conducted a “deep evaluation” of what it means to build a “hallmark” Google experience on iOS. What it found was that many of the custom elements it started building nearly a decade ago to fill gaps in UIKit’s design language are no longer necessary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“With the introduction of SwiftUI and significant UIKit improvements in iOS 14+, it’s never been easier to build a great branded experience with a tiny amount of code,” Verkoeyen said.&nbsp;</p><p>With the shift to UIKit, Verkoeyen expects his team will spend less time building custom code, which should hopefully lead to faster and more frequent releases. Additionally, the use of UIKit should allow the company to more tightly integrate its software into iOS. However, those benefits may pale in comparison to the fact the company’s apps may end up looking more at home on Apple devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-material-design-uikit-171651054.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42af7c33-97f5-4c1c-9a7b-d3b998ec27ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 17:16:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634059015</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T17:16:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/4b726be0-9aa6-11ea-b7ef-c6c327e6cecf" width="3704" height="2469" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/4b726be0-9aa6-11ea-b7ef-c6c327e6cecf" width="3704" height="2469" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 22: The logo of the online map service Goolge Maps is shown on the display of a smartphone on April 22, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

The invitation for the virtual &quot;Unleashed&#39; presentation doesn&#39;t provide many clues, although many unofficially expect Apple to introduce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-new-macbook-pro-2021-m-1-x-152614042.html">14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> based on souped-up M1X processors.</p><p>The new portables are rumored to be significant redesigns that also harken back to the &quot;good old days&quot; of Apple&#39;s pre-2016 models. While they&#39;d have cutting-edge designs, they&#39;d also bring back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-2021-macbook-pro-may-mark-the-return-of-the-mag-safe-connector-091548032.html">MagSafe-like charging</a> and legacy ports like an SD card slot. To no one&#39;s surprise, the M1X would also be far more powerful than the M1 with 10 CPU cores (eight performance and two efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores. There&#39;s a chance Apple might drop the Touch Bar, too, and it&#39;s safe to presume you&#39;ll hear about a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> release date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These might not be the only introductions, either.

The new brand has provided further details of its DreamDrive system, now split into regular and Pro versions. Both variants will include 14 regular cameras, four surround cameras, five radar sensors and a string of ultrasonic sensors, but you&#39;ll need the Air in Dream Edition or Grand Touring trim to get DreamDrive Pro&#39;s LiDAR and the advanced features that will come with it.</p><p>Every Air buyer will get core features like Highway Assist (adaptive cruise control with lane centering), Traffic Jam Assist (lane centering at low speeds), cross-traffic protection and Auto Park (for both parallel and perpendicular parking). The combination of an infrared driver camera and hands-off detection will make sure your head, eyes and (of course) hands are focused on the road. If you&#39;re incapacitated or simply ignore the warnings, DreamDrive will ultimately bring the car to a complete stop, switch on hazard lights and unlock the doors. These will sound familiar on a basic level if you&#39;ve ever used Tesla&#39;s Autopilot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll need DreamDrive Pro to get the most out of Lucid&#39;s platform, however. The Pro tier will include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-user-interface-170054004.html">21-speaker directional alerts</a> as well as the upcoming Highway Pilot system and its &quot;conditional&quot; hands-free driving. Cars with Pro will also get more Highway Assist features through software updates, although Lucid didn&#39;t say when those upgrades might arrive.</p><p>The technology as described won&#39;t yet match all the features from its most advanced rivals, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">Tesla&#39;s Full Self-Driving</a> or GM&#39;s upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-unveils-a-hands-free-driving-system-that-works-in-nearly-all-of-the-us-and-canada-161752431.html">Ultra Cruise</a>. LiDAR could give Lucid an edge, but it could take a long while before the sensor reaches its full potential. Instead, Lucid&#39;s greatest advantage might simply be its more realistic (if still fluffy) marketing. Where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-ftc-tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-192943873.html">Tesla is in trouble</a> for implying its cars are autonomous, Lucid is careful to position DreamDrive as a driver assistance system and not much more.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-dreamdrive-semi-autonomous-features-160026944.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d1f9920-977a-4760-830e-0586d5e05b50</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 16:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634056505</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T16:35:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3495fd30-2b6c-11ec-a5bf-15ff8b5bb26d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3495fd30-2b6c-11ec-a5bf-15ff8b5bb26d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid Air DreamDrive semi-autonomous driving assistance sensors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid Air DreamDrive semi-autonomous driving assistance sensors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VanMoof's fastest e-bike yet tops out at 31 MPH]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>E-bike maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/vanmoof"><ins>VanMoof</ins></a> is looking to help riders get from A to B more swiftly with its first high-speed model.

But it wasn’t the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-plus-review-endless-edge-screen-5g-130039462.html">flagship</a> that we preferred of the two. Instead, we were impressed by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-5g-testing-endless-edge-snapdragon-765g-130047105.html">more modest Edge</a>. It wasn’t perfect, but you got a lot of phone for the price. So it’s not surprising to see Motorola seemingly skip the Edge+ this year and focus instead on the more affordable model. But what comes as a pleasant surprise is just how much of an improvement the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:2021 Edge" href="https://fave.co/3DyeyhE">2021 Edge</a> is. Most important among the updates is a 144Hz screen, a feature normally reserved for top-tier phones. When you add a better fingerprint sensor, superior cameras, and the promise of longer software support, the 2021 Moto Edge is a phone well worth checking out.</p><h2>The display</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/50866b70-2ad5-11ec-afe7-330c8e66309a" alt="Motorola Edge" data-uuid="a03d4eca-33ad-351d-92d0-12737e300a14"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The 2020 Edge was defined by the fact it featured the same 6.7-inch curved “Endless Edge” OLED display as the more expensive Edge+. This year, Motorola has gone with a flat 6.8-inch LCD that makes this new model easier to use. With no rounded edges for your palm to touch, you don’t have to worry about accidentally tapping on an icon or swiping to another part of your home screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides a more practical design, the panel is faster than the one on last year’s model. It can refresh at up to 144Hz, up from 90Hz on the 2020 Edge. Like phones from Samsung and Apple, the panel defaults to an adaptive mode, which limits the refresh rate to 120Hz. Two additional options lock the display to 144Hz and 60Hz, allowing you to prioritize either performance or battery life. I preferred pushing the panel to 144Hz, for reasons I’ll get into in a moment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/989a02f0-2ada-11ec-9dec-85f4cd2ba30d" alt="Moto Edge" data-uuid="27c23709-b8da-33ae-90e7-1baa8c4dd6da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>On paper, the 144Hz panel is an impressive spec that sets the new Moto Edge apart from phones in its price range like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-2-5-g-impressions-release-date-price-144511154.html">OnePlus Nord 2</a> and even more expensive devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. The tradeoff is that it’s a phone with an LCD screen, so you’re missing out on the advantages OLED displays offer, including deep blacks and better power efficiency.</p><p>The Moto Edge’s 144Hz screen also presents some issues I haven’t seen on other devices. With the default adaptive mode enabled, it didn’t always render animations at the same speed. For example, sometimes I would scroll through Instagram and my timeline would breeze by as expected. Other times, it felt like that same action would play out at 60Hz. I suspect this is an issue with the software Motorola wrote to dynamically adjust the refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz. We have asked Motorola for comment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d5c4e590-2b58-11ec-93f3-b2ad21feca15" alt="The Motorola Moto Edge photographed in the street standing up on the edge of a puddle with its reflection visible in the foreground." data-uuid="0fedcc01-0035-3a7e-afb3-dbdbe735a76c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>Locking the display to 144Hz helped address this issue, but there were still moments where I witnessed slight hitching. The faster panel does make the Moto Edge feel smooth and responsive, but don’t expect the same seamless experience you can find on more expensive devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">Galaxy S21</a> and iPhone 13 Pro.</p><p>One other thing I want to note is that the Edge’s 144Hz display does not necessarily make it great for gaming. Unless a developer goes out of its way to update a game for the Moto Edge’s display, as Epic Games did with <em>Fortnite</em> on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-90hz-oneplus-phones-130337931.html">OnePlus</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-90fps-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-141903838.html">Samsung devices</a>, you won’t see a benefit from the faster panel.</p><p>Beyond the fast refresh rate, there’s a lot to like about the Moto Edge’s display. It’s vibrant, bright and supports HDR10, but there are a couple of things that may irk some people. Out of the box, the screen is set to a saturated color mode that overbakes sRGB content. You can switch it to a “Natural” color setting to make images and videos look more realistic. I also recommend playing with the color temperature settings since my unit came with the display too warm.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f35f4330-2ad5-11ec-bfe7-6677e4fd3186" alt="Moto Edge" data-uuid="54011f69-d1d6-3d83-8a5b-1a9167ea0e1b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>You’ll also either love or hate the Moto Edge’s 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The extra real estate is great for scrolling through Instagram, Twitter and other vertical apps but unwieldy when it comes to video content. I’ve been watching a lot of guides and gameplay videos of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bethesda-blizzard-diablo-2-resurrected-hd-remaster-175939269.html"><em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em></a> on YouTube, and it quickly becomes evident that there’s no ideal way to consume 16:9 content on a 19.5:9 display: You either leave the image as is and accept the fact that there’s about a thumb’s worth of wasted space on each end of the screen, or you use YouTube’s pinch-to-zoom functionality to crop into the image. The 19.5:9 aspect ratio may also be too tall for some people to use in one hand.</p><p>If you don’t mind that, the Moto Edge is a great media consumption device. That said, you’ll want to use Bluetooth headphones for watching movies or TV. This year’s model only has a single speaker that sounds tinny and unsatisfying. Oh, and there’s no longer a headphone jack here, one of the few steps down from last year’s model.</p><h2>Other upgrades</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/635cceb0-2ad5-11ec-b68e-a4115024a7e5" alt="Motorola Edge" data-uuid="8499c21c-b6d6-3631-8977-3cfb691a4b65"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Motorola has made two other notable changes. First, it replaced the finicky in-display fingerprint sensor found in last year’s model with a capacitive scanner that’s integrated into the new phone’s side-mounted power button. The company also moved the camera cutout to the center of the screen, which makes taking selfies and video calls feel more natural. But it’s the transition to a traditional fingerprint scanner that makes the most impact.</p><p>Where I live, masks are still mandatory on public transit as well as in stores and restaurants. Coming from inputting my passcode every time I unlock my iPhone or pay for something, the Moto Edge made doing things like buying a croissant at a coffee shop feel, well, normal. The sensor also works well; It’s fast and accurate and I didn’t have to register the same fingerprint multiple times to get it working efficiently, which was a problem we ran into with last year’s model. If companies learn nothing else from the pandemic, I hope it’s that the humble fingerprint sensor has a place on every phone.</p><p>Another highlight of the Moto Edge is battery life. Motorola says you can get up to two days from the phone’s 5,000mAh battery. I found that was possible when I limited the display to 60Hz. On our video rundown battery test, it lasted 19 hours and 45 minutes, which puts it in good company among the phones we’ve tested. Only the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel 5a</a> put up a better result, but it’s worth noting it features a more power-efficient OLED display.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2fb6c2f0-2ad5-11ec-9fb7-eb86aa97e9d6" alt="2021 Motorola Edge" data-uuid="61afab7e-dc69-3396-8a49-e027796aac33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Motorola has also managed to improve the camera system on this year’s Edge, but not in the same meaningful way as the display. The 2021 model features three rear sensors: a 108-megapixel primary system with f/1.9 aperture, an ultra wide-angle and a depth sensor.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it’s the primary camera that’s the highlight. It can take stunning shots during the day and Motorola’s HDR mode does a commendable job of preserving detail. In particularly challenging scenes, the camera tends to blow out highlights while brightening shadows to the point of making them look unrealistic. But when it properly exposes a scene, the results can be eye-catching. Colors appear vibrant and life-like, and there’s almost a physical texture to small details. Unfortunately, Motorola didn’t add OIS to the main camera, which means it can sometimes struggle when there isn’t as much light.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9087c786-c678-41d6-bdef-cba884da4e75"/><p>The 32-megapixel selfie camera is also great. It takes vibrant shots that are sharp and pop with detail. But again, the issue here is when you try to use the camera in a dark room or at night. Without OIS, I found most selfies I took in those situations ended up blurry.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96180540-2ad5-11ec-9c7f-55ff0e1f02a1" alt="Motorola Edge" data-uuid="d138802d-613e-3bc3-90e2-06018aac31e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>Lastly, there’s the 119-degree wide-angle camera that still feels mostly like an afterthought. It offers plenty of horizontal and vertical space but is almost unusable when there isn’t plenty of light. I used the camera extensively on a dark and cloudy morning, and most of the shots I took that day looked smeared.</p><p>I ended up using the wide-angle camera more for macro photography. Unfortunately, that mode has some useability issues too. Focus hunting is a problem; it often took multiple attempts for the camera to lock onto my subject.</p><p>The camera app can be slow to launch and switch between lenses, which is one of the few areas where the Edge’s Snapdragon 778G didn’t have a great showing. My review unit came with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, though you can buy it with up to 8GB of RAM. Besides the issue I noted around the refresh rate, I didn’t run into any other notable performance issues.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d8715770-2ad5-11ec-bfe2-ed4f31d772d3" alt="Moto Edge" data-uuid="b48ae9eb-155a-389a-b352-f72208d9687a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>A Motorola spokesperson told Engadget the company plans to support the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:2021 Edge" href="https://fave.co/3DyeyhE">2021 Edge</a> with two OS upgrades and two years of security updates. That’s a significant change from its predecessor, which only got one Android update.</p><p>When you add that to all the hardware updates the 2021 Edge features, it’s a far more compelling phone than its predecessor and an easier recommendation. For the time being, you can get the unlocked 256GB model for $600. It will eventually cost $700. On October 14th, Verizon will also start selling a 5G UW variant that will go for $550.</p><p>At $600, the Moto Edge is a good option if you don’t mind sacrificing on camera quality and can live without wireless charging. It’s $150 more than a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel 5a</a>, but you’re getting a phone with a better display, faster processor and bigger battery. Even at $700, it still represents good value with specs comparable to devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-and-9-pro-official-141121859.html">OnePlus 9</a>. It’s not without its flaws, but it’s still one of the best mid-range phones on the market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-2021-review-130059627.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">783d77ac-057e-4bc3-986c-18cb0e474852</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 13:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634044555</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T13:16:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/adaab810-2ad5-11ec-afbf-b9d5375231f2" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/adaab810-2ad5-11ec-afbf-b9d5375231f2" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Motorola Edge]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Motorola Edge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[1Password's new feature lets you safely share passwords using just a link]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Password sharing in the workplace and at home is a common practice, but doing so securely can be tricky. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html">1Password</a> aims to address that with its new feature that gives you a way to share log-in credentials in a secure way even with people who don&#39;t have an account with the service. It&#39;s called <a href="https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/">Psst!</a>, which is short for Password Secure Sharing Tool, and it&#39;s apparently one of the company&#39;s most requested features.</p><p>Based on a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-mismanaging-secrets-costs-companies-1-2m-annually-301317447.html">research</a> the company conducted, most workers reuse corporate credentials.

In another <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-40-of-parents-give-preschoolers-a-head-start-in-password-education-301194976.html">survey</a>, 1Password found that most families share passwords between members and also use insecure methods, such as writing them down and messaging them to each other.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Psst! allows you to share credentials with anybody by generating a link with the information that other people can access, even if they don&#39;t have a 1Password account. You can choose how long the link remains valid, from an hour to 30 days, after which it will automatically expire. You can also choose to share the credentials with anybody who has the link or with specific people only. If you choose the latter, the service will require the recipient to confirm their identity by verifying their email addresses before giving them access.&nbsp;</p><p>The service has launched this new feature alongside its announcement that it now has over 100,000 business customers and that it&#39;s growing its employee headcount to 500. Jeff Shiner, CEO of 1Password, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Having the ability to share passwords and other credentials outside of a business or family has been one of our most highly-requested features, and I’m very excited by today’s launch of Psst! as it helps keep everyone, not just 1Password customers, safe online.

Also, tvOS will support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">spatial audio</a> later this year, which means you&#39;ll be able to experience full Dolby Atmos sound if you have the right pair of AirPods to use with the Apple TV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But the kicker for this model is the redesigned Siri remote. The previous remote was kind of a hassle to use, but Apple fixed that this year. This one&#39;s larger and easier to use thanks to its touch-sensitive directional pad that makes scrolling and flipping through content much smoother. We&#39;ve also found Siri to be quite useful on the Apple TV 4K, since the voice assistant excels at answering direct queries like &quot;Play <em>Ted Lasso</em>&quot; or &quot;Show me some scary movies.&quot;</p><p>Siri will also come in handy if you have compatible smart home devices as well. The Apple TV 4K has a built-in HomeKit hub inside, so you can connect devices directly to it. Then, you can ask Siri to show you things like video camera feeds directly on your TV. Overall, while the Apple TV 4K comes at a premium, the extra cost may be worth it for Apple loyalists.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-32gb-2021-deal-with-coupon-at-amazon-123114829.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c208da7a-4031-4d83-b789-1378577b73e6</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 12:31:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634041878</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T12:31:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-9ffe-48814320df2c" width="2000" height="1216" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-9ffe-48814320df2c" width="2000" height="1216" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Infiniti will offer CarPlay as a free upgrade to 'most' 2020 and 2021 models]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple CarPlay has become commonplace since <a href="https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/09/ferrari-wins-iphone-race-1st-carplay-connected-car-for-ios-7-8/">its Ferrari FF debut back in 2014</a> and has finally arrived for the Infiniti brand.

Now, a robotics engineering student has proved that its possible to replace the iPhone&#39;s Lightning connector with a USB-C port, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>On his YouTube channel, EFPL master&#39;s student Ken Pillonel teased an iPhone X with a USB-C port, promising a full video later on how it was done. In an earlier <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/">blog post and video</a>, he explained how he reverse-engineered the Lightning connector, then built a <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/">prototype</a> PCB connector to prove the concept.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c00408ab338c4b0596f6eb115656986a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAekbJf4Gsw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Pillonel discovered that Apple sells a Lightning connector with an integrated circuit (IC), known as C94, to certified partners that build USB-C to Lightning cables. He managed to get one out of a third-party cable, then remove the metallic part and expose the PCB. With that done, he pulled the female Lightning port from an iPhone and soldered wires from the bare C94 board to a PCB with USB-C connectors. &quot;Once that was done I had my first working prototype,&quot; he said. &quot;Lightning is gone and only USB-C is left.&quot;</p><p>The next step was to &quot;fully reverse engineer the C94&quot; board so that everything can be shrunk down to fit into a phone, he said. That part has apparently been done, judging by the video above, and will be fully explained in a second video.</p><p>An iPhone with a USB-C port is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-iphone-11-pro-usb-c-fastcharge.html">dream</a> for many users, as it would allow for faster PD charging and the use of standard, non-proprietary cables. It&#39;s also clearly feasible for Apple, given that the iPad Pro has a USB-C port. Europe has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html">proposed a rule</a> that would require USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, with the aim of reducing e-waste and consumer inconvenience.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not clear if this has been done before, but most folks shouldn&#39;t try a project like this at home. Pillonel has an electronics background and is <a href="https://kenp.io/">working on</a> a Master&#39;s degree in Robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). That&#39;s without mentioning that it would obviously void your iPhone&#39;s warranty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43fdf171-14cd-4a4d-8fa9-b123cee9973b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 11:35:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634048347</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T14:19:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/52ab9c50-2b4c-11ec-9b95-b31298297f21" width="1822" height="1147" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/52ab9c50-2b4c-11ec-9b95-b31298297f21" width="1822" height="1147" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ken Pillonel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The iPhone finally got a USB-C port thanks to a robotics engineer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The iPhone finally got a USB-C port thanks to a robotics engineer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: 15 years of Google Docs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Docs is one of the company’s slow-burn hits. When it appeared 15 years ago, most of us (definitely me) were doing our word processing on Microsoft Office’s Word. It was the defacto option whether you were dealing in PC documents as a worker or a student.</p><p>Then Google’s Docs and Sheets, cloud-based applications that let you collaborate with others in real-time, appeared in beta. Deputy Managing Editor Nathan Ingraham has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-docs-turns-15-190050626.html">charted the course of Google Docs so far,</a> as well as where it might go next, but I recall being an early adopter of Google’s Office rival.</p><p>Due to health issues, I had to repeat a year of my degree studies and split my time between my university and my hometown, which were hundreds of miles apart. It was a time of desktop PCs, library computers and generally anything to do with a PC was more work! I used Docs to draft, write and publish my final-year economics dissertation, even using Sheets for my provincial theories and data analysis on financial returns to higher education.</p><p>It was a revelation — Docs, I mean, not my project. I didn’t have to fear a USB drive not working on public PCs and could open the document wherever there was a PC and an internet connection. Of course, from then on, whether it was studies, work or personal projects, the biggest challenge 15 years ago was convincing others to make the switch from the costs-real-money Microsoft Word.

Along with the brand new Tile Pro, revamped versions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-new-tile-sticker-2019.html"><ins>Sticker, Slim and Mate</ins></a> are available today.</p><p>The Tile Pro is the company&#39;s most powerful tracker to date. It has a finding range of 400 feet, and it&#39;s lightweight and slim, so it could be ideal for helping ensure you don&#39;t lose your keys. Pro has a replaceable battery that should last for up to a year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sticker, Slim and Mate all have increased finding ranges of 250 feet. That&#39;s a 67 percent larger range for Sticker, and a 25 percent wider range for Mate and Slim. The three trackers have a louder ring than before too. Tile claims the latest Mate boasts a three-year battery life (as do Slim and Sticker) and a refreshed design. All four of the trackers have a water resistance rating of IP67. They should withstand being submerged in water up to one meter deep for up to 30 minutes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a77216a0-2841-11ec-b733-c6e01c6695cb" style="height:2490;width:2740;" alt="Tile Lost and Found QR code scanning" data-uuid="616ec33f-7832-33b4-9f74-e0fd3f5e8fd8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tile</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, Tile Lost and Found is another way to help you recover missing items. Except for Sticker, every new Tile has a QR code on the back. Someone who finds a lost tracker can scan it and see the owner&#39;s contact details. They can then figure out how to return the device and attached item to the owner.</p><p>The new and updated models are available from Tile&#39;s website and other retailers. Tile Pro and the credit card-style Slim each cost $35, while Tile Sticker is $30 and a Tile Mate will set you back $25.</p><p>A safety feature is in the works that aims to prevent misuse of a tracker, which is not supposed to keep tabs on a person&#39;s location. The Scan and Secure feature will let anyone with the Tile app, whether or not they have an active account, detect nearby Tile devices and figure out if an unknown device is close to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Tile will roll out the feature on Android and iOS in early 2022. The company says it&#39;s working with advocacy organizations to improve the feature and bolster safety, and notes it will provide resources to victims who believe someone may be tracking them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fafa3690-2841-11ec-bfc3-49c62af026fc" style="height:3441;width:5649;" alt="Tile Ultra&#39;s augmented reality experience for finding lost items.

UWB devices can transmit directional and spatial data to narrow down their location more accurately than over Bluetooth alone.</p><p>The tracker&#39;s Point and Locate feature lets you use augmented reality to find the item with turn-by-turn directions and a visual indicator of where the tracker is. Tile&#39;s working with Google to refine the feature for Android 12 and UWB-capable phones</p><p>Tile says Ultra is the first UWB tracker that works on both iOS and Android.

Tile Ultra will be available in early 2022.</p><p>Even though both Apple and Samsung released competing trackers this year, Tile&#39;s business is still going well. The company says its revenue grew by over 50 percent in the first half of 2021. The latest trackers could put Tile in good stead for the short term, but the growing market might draw in more competitors in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tile-pro-ultra-wideband-tracker-new-devices-100025451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd4d69f8-7c5a-40f8-83ca-98b217e55d2e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 10:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633704238</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T14:44:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a893bdd0-2842-11ec-b3ff-a1a1de6b9f23" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a893bdd0-2842-11ec-b3ff-a1a1de6b9f23" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tile]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tile's latest Bluetooth trackers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tile's latest Bluetooth trackers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter begins rolling out its Spaces tab on iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in September, Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-discovery-recording-180717328.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s working on a dedicated tab for Spaces to make it easier for users to find relevant conversations they can listen to.

Epic originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-google-play-lawsuit-035741548.html">sued</a> Google in August, shortly after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sues-apple-195415590.html">filed a complaint</a> against, and was countersued by, Apple. &quot;Epic has alternatively been unjustly enriched at Google&#39;s expense,&quot; the company said in its complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, Epic sued Google for removing <em>Fortnite</em> from its Play Store after a &quot;Mega Drop&quot; update gave players a way to bypass Play and get <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html">discounted items</a>. Google later forced OnePlus to break off a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-90hz-oneplus-phones-130337931.html">deal</a> that would have seen the <em>Fortnite</em> launcher pre-installed on its OnePlus 8 smartphone, bypassing the Play Store and eliminating Google&#39;s commission on in-app purchases.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google stated that unlike with Apple&#39;s App Store, Android developers aren&#39;t forced to use Google Play. &quot;They choose to use it when given a choice among Android app stores and distribution channels,&quot; according to the complaint. &quot;Google supports that choice through Android itself, Google Play&#39;s policies and Google&#39;s agreements with developers and device manufacturers.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Unlike competitors like Apple, Google does not require Android users or developers to use Google Play in order to download, install, or distribute apps on Android.</p></blockquote><p>That argument is complicated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust">documents</a> unsealed in Epic&#39;s original lawsuit against Google, however. They showed that Google paid other game developers and phone makers like LG and Motorola to exclusively use the Play Store rather than offering other store options. That&#39;s one reason cited by the 38 US states and territories that filed an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html">antitrust suit</a> against Google, in the same California federal court where Epic filed its own claim.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Google reportedly offered Epic up to $208 million to bring <em>Fortnite</em> to the Play Store — effectively cutting its usual 30 percent take by around five percent. According to the same court documents, Google was so concerned by a potential loss of Play Store revenue that it even considered acquiring Epic.</p><p>Epic received a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">mixed ruling</a> in its lawsuit battle with Apple. On the one hand, judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to eliminate App Store rules that prevent developers from adding in-app links to payment sites. On the other, she ruled that Apple was not anticompetitive based on California law and ordered Epic to pay Apple $3.6 million. Both parties have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-files-appeal-app-store-injunction-101556698.html">appealed</a> that ruling, and Apple has said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html">won&#39;t let</a><em>Fortnite</em> back on the store until all appeals are resolved.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-epic-for-sidestepping-fees-on-in-game-purchases-084602622.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52fed4f5-7ff8-4741-9768-d65f01ef1017</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 08:46:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634028695</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T08:51:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8615ab20-2b39-11ec-9cfb-0eff9ddb937f" width="2000" height="1310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8615ab20-2b39-11ec-9cfb-0eff9ddb937f" width="2000" height="1310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google countersues Epic Games for sidestepping fees on in-app purchases]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google countersues Epic Games for sidestepping fees on in-app purchases]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
