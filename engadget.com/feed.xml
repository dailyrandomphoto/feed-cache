The single-player campaign starts out as a basic first-person shooter dripping in nostalgia juice, and it ends up as a rudimentary open-world shooter swimming in sci-fi tropes, starring everyone&#39;s favorite emotionless space soldier and his co-dependent AI assistant.</p><p>As the first open-world entry in the Halo franchise and with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-delay-2021-193546027.html">more than a year of extra development time</a>, I had high hopes for <em>Infinite</em>. Maybe too high. And even with a grapple hook, this game just can’t reach them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I say all of this with love in my heart. I’ve been a Halo fan since <em>Combat Evolved</em>, and I have two decades of happy memories associated with the franchise, most of which I’ve re-lived while playing <em>Infinite</em>. That part has been a treat — there’s nothing like turning the corner in a random metal-lined corridor, or driving a Warthog down a narrow mountain path, and feeling that warm, gleeful sense of familiarity. This happens over and over again in <em>Infinite</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/172ea620-5623-11ec-af7f-b718a74dfe6d" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="146df28c-11a6-3b5b-92fd-1f2aaffee527"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Revamping old environments is the easy part, though. <em>Halo Infinite</em> is the first open-world entry in the franchise’s history, promising more exploration and spontaneity for Master Chief than ever before. However, in practice, the world of Zeta Halo is contained and largely linear, offering few surprises and little incentive to travel off the beaten path. There are bases to capture and hordes to defeat, but with such a cramped map, these sidequests pop up naturally along the path of the main storyline, and the game automatically switches the objective to whatever mission is nearby. Sidequests are folded into the campaign like this, and they become indistinguishable from the main missions.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I felt ready to get out and explore the Ring, I realized I’d already hit all the icons on my map.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734e7b1-5623-11ec-bdff-74522019ccca" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="fcca5600-d43d-3904-b97a-75fd4b295236"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, <em>Infinite </em>introduces new mechanics and tools that are really fun to play with, and the best of these gadgets is the grapple hook. There are no invisible walls in <em>Infinite</em>, and the grapple hook allows players to take advantage of Zeta Halo’s vertical space, scaling mountains and buildings in a series of pops and swings. The grapple hook opens up fresh vantage points for every battle, and it saved my Master Chief from falling to his death many times over. (I may have even sang, &quot;Spider-Chief, Spider-Chief...&quot; under my breath every now and then. Maybe.)</p><p>Playing with an Xbox controller, the grapple hook lives on the D-pad, alongside three other tools that get added to Chief&#39;s arsenal as the game progresses: a shield, radar darts and a dash move that I rarely use. I’ve tried to deploy the dash, but I really don’t see the point when the grapple hook does the same thing, but faster and in more directions.&nbsp;</p><p>Switching among these options on the D-pad takes some practice, but once that becomes second-nature, the hook, shield and radar make each fight more dynamic than Halo’s ever been. The grapple hook allows Master Chief to pick up objects from afar like guns and throwable explosives, it eventually shocks enemies on contact, and it lets players smoothly take over enemy vehicles. <em>Infinite </em>is at its best when it provides a rich environment for grappling, shielding and landing floaty in-air headshots, with enemies attacking from all sides.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/17349990-5623-11ec-a1ef-d15d0bcef793" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="2fccd9bb-aa93-3120-82be-dbb73f0da1a3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Now I’m going to talk some shit about the grapple hook. I know, I just sang its praises, and I stand by everything I said, but I have to put it all in context. From my perspective, the most obvious innovation in <em>Halo Infinite </em>is its use of vertical space, aided by the grapple hook — but that’s hardly a new idea at all, and frankly, other games have done it better.&nbsp;</p><p>To name just a few recent examples: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-02-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> made headlines in 2017 for rethinking vertical exploration in an open-world space; last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doom-eternal-fps-irl-133006155.html"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a> beautifully demonstrated the power of parkour mechanics in an FPS environment; and Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html">Spider-Man series</a> has perfected the art of high-swinging action. In comparison to games like these, <em>Infinite</em>’s mechanics aren’t innovative at all.</p><p>I bring this up because I think it’s a disservice to compare <em>Halo Infinite</em> only to other Halo games, rather than its competitors. After all, competition is the root of evolution — and that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-halo-combat-evolved-mcc-for-pc.html">kind of Halo&#39;s jam</a>. I expected more from a pioneer of the FPS genre as it ventured into open-world gaming. Just because it’s new for Halo doesn’t mean it’s new for the industry.</p><section data-eng-breakout="68c717b5f4dc4d9ab34eabb3eba51eda" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734e7b0-5623-11ec-bf56-77dedbf80bee" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="17c2460f-612d-3fee-8196-2dbf3051d28e"></section><p>Even with the fresh toys and larger world, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game. The levels are repetitive and mazelike, and the story is packed with military stereotypes, sarcastic robots, women in skin-tight bodysuits and cheesy dialogue. There are a handful of cool new weapons, like the reticle-shifting Heatwave and the revolver-like Mangler, and the entire map is generously stocked with loose ammo and guns. It’s a blockbuster action movie in interactive form, and it has high-energy, entertaining moments, but these are largely overshadowed by the simplistic grind of it all.</p><p>Overall, <em>Halo Infinite</em> lacks surprise and intrigue, from the map to individual fights. Failing a boss battle, for instance, rarely feels like a failure of strategy. These encounters generally take place in simple settings with repetitive attacks, and I don’t feel like I’m learning anything new with each runthrough; I’m just going through the motions until I catch a lucky break and I can follow the yellow diamond to my next checkpoint. And then the next. And the next.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734c0a0-5623-11ec-bddf-a8d33063575f" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="dcacbef8-c552-3b0b-8864-578122eb25cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>All of this should make for an incredibly fun multiplayer component, and so far, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-preview-xbox-series-x-080130895.html">seems like that’s the case</a>. Maybe<em> Infinite</em>’s campaign is more engaging in split-screen co-op, historically my preferred way to play, but that mode <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-forge-delayed-183757524.html">won’t be available until next year</a>. Neither will Forge mode, for that matter.</p><p>If <em>Halo Infinite</em> had launched day-one with the Xbox Series X and S, I likely wouldn’t have many complaints. The fact that 343 Industries and Microsoft took an extra year to build this game, hyping it up the whole way through, shifted my expectations a bit. Maybe too much.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, I’ll see you in the <em>Halo: Infinite</em> multiplayer lobby on December 8th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85fb6f14-9753-4ae2-9bea-0bc0b214d114</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:01:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638748744</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T23:59:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b9c20a0-5622-11ec-bf3d-62094bf84d1e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b9c20a0-5622-11ec-bf3d-62094bf84d1e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Fire tablets are back on sale for as low as $35]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed a chance to pick up an Amazon Fire tablet on the cheap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/most-amazon-fire-tablets-are-down-to-record-low-prices-right-now-093003172.html">during Black Friday</a>, worry not: they’re on sale again.

We awarded it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-review-130005977.html">score of 81</a> on the back of its refined design, all-day battery life, decent performance and new USB-C port. You can configure the Fire 8 HD with up to 64GB of internal storage. The included microSD slot allows you to add up to 1TB of additional storage. Like all of Amazon’s Fire tablet, the HD 8 is best seen as a media consumption device, but if you want the best possible experience, then it’s worth spending the extra $45 to pick up the Fire HD 10. It has the best display of the trio thanks to a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution panel. It’s also the fastest due to the inclusion of an 2.0GHz octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM. And if all you want is something affordable, it’s hard to go wrong with the Fire 7, especially when it costs less than $50.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tablets-holiday-sale-080021175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed5f5914-36a3-43d0-847a-2058ebce4a30</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638743804</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T22:36:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/39df5b50-ab3f-11ea-ace3-4aaf1bd717c4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/39df5b50-ab3f-11ea-ace3-4aaf1bd717c4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto exchange BitMart loses $196 million to hackers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-161726337.html">Large-scale cryptocurrency heists</a> remain a significant headache. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/05/crypto-exchange-bitmart-hacked-with-losses-estimated-at-196-million/">According</a> to <em>Coindesk</em>, the crypto exchange BitMart <a href="https://twitter.com/sheldonbitmart/status/1467316252855226368">has lost</a> the equivalent of $196 million (originally estimated at $150 million) to a hack.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html">Charge 5</a> has returned to a record-low price <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Charge 5" href="https://amzn.to/3IePRK6">of $130</a> at Amazon, or $50 below its usual sticker. That could make it a solid bargain if you&#39;re looking for a high-end, fitness-focused activity tracker from a well-known name. The Inspire 2 is also down <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Inspire 2" href="https://amzn.to/3xW87TU">to $60</a> (normally $100) if you&#39;re happy with the essentials.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3IePRK6" id="bf481241732d4770a3b4871d3d28e3c2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Charge 5">Buy Charge 5 at Amazon - $130</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xW87TU" id="ac4b13b1d6f64fb6afdec07a2637e92d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Inspire 2">Buy Inspire 2 at Amazon - $60</a><p>The Charge 5 ticks many of the boxes if you&#39;re determine to stay in shape. The extensive fitness and health tracking features help, particularly if you get the advanced data from Fitbit Premium. You can optimize your workout performance and understand your sleep quality, for instance. You can track your stress in addition to heart rate and blood oxygen level, and you&#39;ll have perks like GPS, Fitbit Pay and multi-day battery life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are limitations. Fitbit doesn&#39;t share activity data with Apple Health or Google Fit, and you can&#39;t steer music from the tracker&#39;s screen. There&#39;s also the matter of competition: you can find some close-enough alternatives from companies like Amazfit, Xiaomi and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">Amazon itself</a> that will cost less (at least up front) if you can do without some frills. Fitbit&#39;s experience in the field matters, though, and the sale price makes the Charge 5 considerably more tempting.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-amazon-sale-december-2021-164046215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">82e6bac4-49e3-40e9-b9d8-e200d5399b7b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 16:40:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638722452</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T16:41:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6f5ec8f0-55e4-11ec-ad4d-0378eb0e51e1" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6f5ec8f0-55e4-11ec-ad4d-0378eb0e51e1" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5 activity tracker starting exercise]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5 activity tracker starting exercise]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Fortnite' Chapter 3 officially debuts with a new island and revamped gameplay]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It didn&#39;t take long for Epic to confirm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leak-spider-man-213150967.html"><em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 3</a> details. The developer has officially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knAYcg7Tt8E">released</a> a trailer that outlines what to expect both in Chapter 3 and its first season, &quot;Flipped.&quot; The new island is the star, with the flip from the Chapter 2 finale leading to a complete landscape overhaul that includes chaotic weather. However, the gameplay changes are arguably more important — you&#39;ll have to rethink your tactics.</p><p>The sliding and swinging mechanics should help you move (and dodge) faster than before. Camps help your squad heal and store items that persist between matches. You can also earn XP beyond battle royale, and hold on to a Victory Crown if you keep winning. Epic is clearly hoping to both foster a non-combat <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-party-worlds-epic-metaverse-142555354.html">metaverse</a> and keep its top-tier players coming back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And yes, there are new characters. Spider-Man is well-suited to the new swinging mechanic, but you can also play as Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&#39;s <em>Fortnite</em> character The Foundation, or <em>Gears of War</em>&#39;s Marcus and Kait. Think of them as the poster children for Chapter 3. They may help draw you in, but it&#39;s the fresh gameplay that might keep you playing in the long run.</p><div id="6211880a1e46476bb9857ba3d5c2e377"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/knAYcg7Tt8E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-details-152414741.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fbda5dd0-6b2e-413e-a256-9690f79db504</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 15:24:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638717857</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T15:24:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09ed7070-55da-11ec-b4f9-7205a53c507f" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09ed7070-55da-11ec-b4f9-7205a53c507f" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Epic Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Fortnite' Chapter 3 trailer with Spider-Man]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Fortnite' Chapter 3 trailer with Spider-Man]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clearview AI will get a US patent for its facial recognition tech]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-a-is-facial-recognition-tech-comes-under-fire-in-europe-122013392.html">Clearview AI</a> is about to get formal acknowledgment for its controversial facial recognition technology. <em>Politico</em><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/04/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-523735">reports</a> Clearview has received a US Patent and Trademark Office &quot;notice of allowance&quot; indicating officials will approve a filing for its system, which scans faces across public internet data to find people from government lists and security camera footage.

However, the patent left the door open to non-government purposes, like learning more about a dating partner or business client. Clearview is aware of the problematic path its technology might take, even if it doesn&#39;t intend to head in that direction.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-patent-222347603.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35aa06ac-9b5a-4597-96c2-bffc9d0b8af8</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 22:23:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638656631</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T22:24:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/8c36d6a0-60fc-11e9-bff3-cafa68905d76" width="4909" height="3273" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/8c36d6a0-60fc-11e9-bff3-cafa68905d76" width="4909" height="3273" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Peter / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People walk past a poster simulating facial recognition software at the Security China 2018 exhibition on public safety and security in Beijing, China October 24, 2018.

As <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leaks-revealing-spider-man-1848161056">learned</a>, the game&#39;s official Polish YouTube channel briefly <a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealGalaxyBoi/status/1467063354745257985">shared</a> a Chapter 3 trailer revealing many of the planned changes to the battery royale brawler. You can expect a new island (and new characters, including <em>Gears of War</em>&#39;s Marcus and Kait as well as Spider-Man — there even appears to be web-swinging like you&#39;ve seen in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html">Insomniac&#39;s Spider-Man games</a>, not to mention locales like the Daily Bugle.</p><p>Chapter 3 will add some new mechanics on top of fresh weapons and items.

However, Epic wasn&#39;t afraid to repeat history and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-13-fortnite-the-end-event.html">kick players out</a> of <em>Fortnite</em> as the previous chapter came to an end.

The social network <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-admits-error-in-account-suspensions/">told</a><em>The Washington Post</em> it suspended the accounts of 12 journalists and anti-extremism researchers by mistake after far-right activists and white supremacists sent a &quot;coordinated and malicious&quot; flurry of bogus reports attempting to silence critics. It wasn&#39;t clear how many reports had been sent beyond a &quot;significant amount.&quot;</p><p>The company said it was already reversing bans and had begun an internal review to make sure the policy was used &quot;as intended.&quot; More data on the volume of false accusations would come later.

The missing albums come from stars like Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish and John Mulaney.</p><p>As with earlier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-08-spotify-secret-genius-songwriters.html">songwriter disputes</a>, this latest fight revolves around compensating more than just the performance. Spoken Giants wants its artists to receive royalties as the joke writers, not just for their time behind the microphone. The rights firm started talking to online services in the spring, but learned just before American Thanksgiving that Spotify would pull comedians&#39; work until there was an agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify defended itself in a statement to the <em>Journal</em>. The company said it paid a &quot;significant&quot; amount of money for the comedy material and would &quot;love&quot; to keep paying, and that distributors and labels also had a say regarding payouts. Some material remains from those comedians on Spotify as of this writing, but much more of it is available through rivals like Apple Music.</p><p>It&#39;s not surprising that Spotify would clash with Spoken Giants. If Spotify also had to pay writing royalties, the service would either have to pay more overall (clearly Spoken Giants&#39; ideal outcome) or set aside some of the existing share for distributors and labels. Either could hurt Spotify&#39;s bottom line, and it doesn&#39;t have much breathing room when its average revenue per person was about $4.91 <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/streaming/spot/spotify-earnings-why-the-stock-spiked-on-q3-results">last quarter</a>.</p><p>At the same time, though, the dispute and removal come at a particularly sensitive time. With live standup still far from what it was before the pandemic, some comedians are still highly dependent on albums and other digital releases. They&#39;re clearly eager to improve that income, and may feel some extra pain when they lose the support of a streaming heavyweight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-pulls-comedians-albums-over-royalty-dispute-180042056.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8faa665-6266-45cb-a32f-dc252e922ef0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 18:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638640847</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T18:00:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3311d060-ceb5-11eb-9fff-9dacb49eed6d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3311d060-ceb5-11eb-9fff-9dacb49eed6d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dimitrios Kambouris via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNCASVILLE, CT - OCTOBER 14:  Headliner Kevin Hart performs stand-up comedy at Mohegan Sun as part of the 20th Anniversary Comedy All-Star Gala event at Mohegan Sun on October 14, 2016 in Uncasville, Connecticut.

Steve Dent and a licensed drone pilot toured the French countryside with the help of the DJI Mavic 3 drone, while Terrence O’Brien played with the Animoog Z app, a sequel ten years in the making. Also, Cherlynn Low played around with Android 12 to check out its new Material You design.</p><h2>The Mavic 3 is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-review-cinematic-power-at-a-price-150029600.html">easiest DJI drone to fly</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/792be770-5475-11ec-84ff-19101d72dfea" alt="DJI Mavic 3" data-uuid="d1d4c64d-89d1-34e1-8d26-548eaf071023"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent spent some time with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:DJI Mavic 3" href="https://fave.co/3IlHZXa">DJI Mavic 3</a> and a licensed drone pilot in the French countryside to see what the new device is capable of. He reports that not only is the Mavic 3 the easiest DJI drone to fly, but the large 4/3 sensor and dual camera system produce incredible footage – and the 46 minutes of range is double the time that the previous model could capture. He tested the standard model in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$3,000 Fly More combo package" href="https://fave.co/3xRgHDm">$3,000 Fly More combo package</a>, which includes three batteries, a charging hub, one set of ND filters and a carrying bag. The Mavic 3 is also available in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cine mode" href="https://fave.co/3IudRcz">Cine mode</a> with a built-in 1TB SSD and Apple ProRes 422 HQ video support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Mavic 3 was easier to maneuver thanks to its improved obstacle avoidance, it was also easy to fold the 899-gram drone into a more compact size for storage and travel. Steve says the camera and video specs are impressive: the primary camera was built in collaboration with Hasselblad and has a 24mm f/2.8-f/11 lens with a color profile for accurate hues. The video camera can shoot 5.1K at 50fps or 4K at 60fps; Steve says the larger sensor provides better low light performance, more detail and great dynamic range. However, there are some downsides – namely the price, but also that the additional features that DJI promised (like ActiveTrack5 and QuickShots) aren&#39;t available now but will be released in January. Overall, Steve says the Mavic 3 delivers, but is best for professions and prosumers.</p><h2>Google’s Material You design gives Android 12 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html">much-needed visual update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/175165c0-5475-11ec-b3e6-937a05f6bfec" alt="Android 12" data-uuid="51bb46ca-3f29-39fe-ae68-c9c126372361"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low knows that the many versions of Android make a review of the core features a bit difficult, but the upgrades on the operating system’s most recent release make for a refreshing experience and provide more transparency over data and privacy. That’s largely thanks to the new Material You design that has decluttered the UI and enlarged buttons and sliders, among other things. Cherlynn particularly liked the Privacy Dashboard that informs users when their camera and mic are activated, along with which apps require them. Android 12 also has new indicators for when the camera or mic are actively being used.</p><p>Cherlynn did note some aspects that disappointed her, namely the default way to summon the Google Assistant, and the confusing charts and graphs in the battery and privacy dashboards. She was also excited to try the audio-coupled haptic feedback, but wasn’t able to find any apps that supported it. Overall, she said that the visual updates in Material You and increased privacy tools made the system feel drastically different — in a good way.</p><h2>The Animoog Z app is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-animoog-z-i-os-softsynth-music-app-170019893.html">a proper sequel that took ten years to make</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ced04d20-5474-11ec-affb-662506c56596" alt="Moog Animoog Z" data-uuid="b4d70e70-8332-3705-8173-22918befe6fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien was looking forward to testing out <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/animoog-z">Animoog Z</a>, the follow up to Moog’s original software instrument which used wavetable synthesis. This sequel to the app has largely the same core Anisotropic Synth Engine, consisting of dozens of waveforms that you can choose from, ranging from samples of analog saw waves to more digital sounds. However, the new release adds a third dimension to the X/Y axis of the original — a Z axis that notes can move along.</p><p>Terrence says this gives the new app a bit more depth and room to evolve. He found that certain presets took advantage of the additional modulation path to make more complex and unique sounds. There’s also a new effects section with a looper, delay, filter and an arpeggiator, plus MPE support. Additionally, Terrence says the redesigned look that the new app has makes it feel more modern and easier to navigate. After testing, he declared the Animoog Z a worthy successor to the groundbreaking original. A limited version is available as a free download, with the full featured version going for a flat $10.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-check-out-android-12s-visual-refresh-170059195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">666717d6-70f3-4172-8c42-33499bdd3325</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638564138</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T20:42:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA will give SpaceX more crewed flights to cover for Boeing's delays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boeing&#39;s continued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-2022-164715835.html">Starliner delays</a> have prompted NASA to hedge its bets. <em>SpaceNews</em><a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-award-spacex-three-more-commercial-crew-flights/">reports</a> NASA <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/12/03/nasa-to-secure-additional-commercial-crew-transportation/">plans to order</a> as many as three more crewed SpaceX flights to ensure &quot;uninterrupted&quot; US trips to the International Space Station as soon as 2023. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-crew-3-livestream-213038925.html">Crew Dragon</a> is the only system that meets  partner country and safety requirements in the necessary time window, the agency said. In other words, NASA doesn&#39;t want to be without a ride to the ISS if Boeing isn&#39;t ready.</p><p>NASA was happy Boeing was focusing on &quot;safety over schedule&quot; for Starliner after it delayed a second orbital test to investigate an oxidizer isolation valve problem. However, that still left the administration in a bind. It was &quot;critical&quot; to obtain additional flights now to maintain a US foothold on the ISS, associate administrator Kathy Lueders said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This doesn&#39;t put Boeing&#39;s capsule in danger. NASA still wanted two different crew systems to guarantee redundancy, and it planned to alternate between Crew Dragon and Starliner once both were available. Officials also stressed that the deal didn&#39;t prevent NASA from changing the contract to obtain additional flights.</p><p>Even so, the intended purchase is a blow for Boeing. Starliner plays a key role in Boeing&#39;s commercial spaceflight program and, unofficially, serves as proof the transportation veteran can compete with a fast-moving &#39;newcomer&#39; like SpaceX in the private space race. The Crew Dragon backup plans reflect some lost confidence in Boeing, even if the move is only temporary.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-adds-spacex-flights-due-to-boeing-starliner-delay-164503658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f09239ec-fe74-4d21-a967-00cd2d5bab29</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:45:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638636308</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T16:45:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f5ce2e0-551c-11ec-af7f-b57f4be9373e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f5ce2e0-551c-11ec-af7f-b57f4be9373e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX, Flickr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on return from Crew-2 mission]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on return from Crew-2 mission]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How the interplay of science and technology brought about iPhones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientific research and technological advancement have gone hand-in-hand since the invention of the wheel.

These patterns can be thought of as questions: Why does a particular pattern occur? Why when one releases a ball does the ball fall and fall faster the farther it has fallen? Explanations of those raw patterns come a level below in the hierarchy, and can be thought of as answers to those questions: Galileo’s sixteenth-century explanation of the observed distance-versus-time pattern was that the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time. But this answer, or explanation, becomes itself another question: Why do the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time? This question begs a deeper explanation, a deeper answer: Newton’s explanation was that gravity is a force, that uniform forces cause uniform acceleration, and that uniform acceleration causes linear increases in velocity. Scientific understanding is always incomplete, of course, so there is always a point at which we have no deeper explanation. This in no way detracts from the power of the explanations that do exist: science seeks proximate whys but does not insist on ultimate whys. The general theory of relativity explains Newton’s laws of gravity, even if its own origin is yet to be explained.</p><p>In technology, at the top of the hierarchy are human-desired functions. These functions present problems that are solved by forms below them in the hierarchy. Forms fulfill functions, but those forms present new problems that must be solved at successively deeper levels. Shifting from the problem-solution nomenclature to the equivalent question-answer nomenclature, we can say that the iPhone represented a technological question: How do we create an Internet-capable cellular phone with a software-programmable interactive display? A partial answer came in the form of multi touch capacitive surfaces, opening up a significant design space for user interaction when multiple fingers are used simultaneously. But the opaqueness of existing multitouch surfaces itself became a question: How do we make multi touch surfaces transparent so that the display is visible? The multi touch transparent surface display provided an answer.</p><p>In other words, science and technology are both organized into hierarchies of question-and-answer pairs, with any question or answer having two “faces.” One face, pointing downward in the hierarchy, represents a question to an answer just below it in the hierarchy. The other face, pointing upward in the hierarchy, represents an answer to a question just above it in the hierarchy. We emphasize that our depiction of questions as “above” answers and answers as “below” questions is arbitrary — it does not signify relative importance or value but is simply intended to be consistent with common usage. In science, an explanation is deeper and more “foundational” than the fact it explains, especially if it generalizes to explanations of many other facts. Special relativity is, in that sense, deeper than the constancy of c because it answers the question of why c is constant; it also answers the question of how much energy is released during nuclear fission and fusion. In technology, forms are deeper and more “foundational” than the functions they fulfill, especially if they have been adapted to fulfill many other functions. The multi touch transparent surface display is more foundational than the iPhone because it not only helps answer the question of how to create the iPhone, but also helps answer the question of how to create human-interactive displays in general. Rubber is more foundational than a bicycle tire because it not only helps answer the question of how to create a bicycle tire, but also helps answer the question of how to create a myriad of other kinds of tires.</p><h3>The Network Is Modular: Facilitating Exploitation and Exploration</h3><p>Closely related scientific questions and answers are organized into what we might call scientific domains, which we will refer to as scientific knowledge modules. Closely interacting technological problems and solutions are organized into engineered components, which we will refer to as technological knowledge modules.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/038d8cb0-545e-11ec-b0af-f970a83638da" style="height:463;width:735;" alt="fig 2-2" data-uuid="c9083205-5dc8-3e86-a418-93e62299de7a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard University Press</div></figure><p>Closely related scientific questions are often answerable within a scientific knowledge domain, or scientific knowledge module, drawing on multiple subdomains nested within the larger domain. A question related to some electron transport phenomenon in a particular semiconductor structure lies in the broad domain of semiconductor science but the answer might require an integrated understanding of both the subdomain of electron transport physics as well as the subdomain of the materials science of the synthesized structure. The subquestion associated with electron transport physics might require an integrated understanding of the subdomain of electrons in various kinds of structures (bulk materials, heterojunctions, nanostructures, coupled nanostructures) and of the sub-subdomains of interactions of electrons with phonons in those structures. The subquestion associated with the materials science of the synthesized structure might require an understanding of the sub-subdomains of substrates and epitaxy, thin films, or post materials synthesis fabrication. In other words, we can think of scientific knowledge domains as a modular hierarchy, and think of its subdomains as submodules and sub-submodules.</p><p>Closely related technological problems, likewise, are often solved by key technological components, or technological knowledge modules, perhaps integrating multiple subcomponents nested within the larger components. An iPhone is a component itself composed of many subcomponents, and each subcomponent is similarly subdivided. We can think of the “problem” of the iPhone as a component that is “solved” by its subcomponents — an enclosure, a display, a printed circuit board, a camera, and input / output ports. We can think of the “problem” of a printed circuit board as a subcomponent that is “solved” by sub-components that include low-power integrated circuit chips. Conversely, an iPhone is also a component that is itself nested in a hierarchy of use functions. An iPhone might be used as a solution to the problem of “running” a text-messaging app; a text-messaging app might be used as a solution to the problem of sending a mass text message to a friend group; the mass text message might be used as a solution to the problem of organizing the friend group into a protest in Times Square; and the protest in Times Square might be part of a solution to the problem of organizing a wider social movement for some human-desired social cause.</p><p>One might ask: Why is scientific and technological knowledge modular? They are modular because they are complex adaptive systems — systems sustained by and adapted to their environment by complex internal changes — and virtually all complex adaptive systems are modular (Simon, 1962). Complex adaptive systems both exploit their environments and explore their environments to improve that exploitation. Modularity enables efficiency, both in the exploitation of existing knowledge about the environment and exploration of that environment to create new knowledge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-genesis-of-technoscientific-revolutions-narayanmurti-tsao-harvard-press-163025911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fcee4b1-e8d0-4f63-b108-17c5b1e039e5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:30:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638553332</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:42:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 10: Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller talks about the new iPhone 11 Pro during a special event on September 10, 2019 in the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's Cupertino, California campus.

In the wake of a <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/">report</a> raising questions about Activision Blizzard&#39;s involvement at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/game-awards-nominees-2021-180501577.html">2021 Game Awards</a>, producer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264">confirmed</a> the publisher wouldn&#39;t have a role at the show outside of the nominations chosen by influencers and media. There&#39;s &quot;no place&quot; for abuse and harassment anywhere, Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008291582537732">said</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;He <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008292660527105">added</a> that the industry needed to &quot;work together&quot; to create a more inclusive space for developing games. The focus was on celebrating games and the people who made them, <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008293860429825">according</a> to the founder. Keighley already said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-diablo-4-212039519.html"><em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em></a> wouldn&#39;t appear during the presentation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear if the scandal had a direct impact on Activision&#39;s presence, but it&#39;s a contrast from 2020. Then, the company used the Game Awards to show <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-s1-warzone-modern-warfare-115815647.html">first season</a> of battle royale material.</p><p>Questions remain, though. Most notably, the awards&#39; advisory panel includes Activision Blizzard president Rob Kostich. The publisher still technically holds some sway over the event, even if it didn&#39;t dictate much of the show in practice.

We saw a bunch go on sale for Black Friday, but now Wellbots is having a sale on one of Roomba&#39;s most advanced models. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Roomba s9+</a> is $200 off right now when you use the code <strong>ENGADGET200</strong> at checkout, so you&#39;ll end up paying $899 for the machine — that&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen it and even cheaper than it was last month during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm" id="dc1aea0b3953401b946029fd82d9c642" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Roomba s9+ at Wellbots - $899</a><p>The s9+ is even more advanced than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">new Roomba j7+</a> that came out recently, although it does not have Precision Vision Navigation like the latter. Instead, the S9+ has the most suction power of any Roomba along with dual multi-surface brushes and Direct Detect technology, the latter of which helps the vacuum focus on the dirtiest spots in your home until they&#39;re fully clean. &quot;Power-lift suction&quot; also helps it deep clean carpets and suck up pet hair. It has sensors to help it move around objects like chairs and tablets and, thanks to its mapping technology, you can have it clean only certain rooms or areas of your home if you wish.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This model also has the clean base that comes with other more expensive Roombas. After each job, the s9+ will automatically return to its base for a recharge, and it will empty its bin into the clean base, which is basically an attached garbage can. That means you don&#39;t have to fuss with the vacuum every time you run it, and you&#39;ll only have to empty the clean base once every 60 days. That combined with the robot&#39;s easy-to-use companion app makes it a premium convenience machine — if you use iRobot&#39;s mobile app to start or schedule cleanings, you may not even have to touch the s9+ for weeks at a time while it does its job.</p><p>Even on sale, the Roomba s9+ is a big purchase — but it may be worth it for those who hate vacuuming and want their homes to be as clean as possible without having to do much themselves. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget options</a>, though, if you&#39;d rather save a good chunk of money and still get the benefits of a robot vacuum. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3EuUai0">Roomba 694</a> is a good option, as well as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker RoboVac 11S" href="https://amzn.to/3ogWvaP">Anker RoboVac 11S</a>. The former can be controlled via a mobile app while the latter comes with a remote that lets you maneuver the vacuum like a toy car in addition to setting schedules and the like.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-s9-plus-vacuum-with-clean-base-is-200-off-right-now-150049330.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2debba16-749f-4ea9-8e66-f7b10c2311e3</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 15:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638475947</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T20:12:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s Roomba s9+ vacuum with clean base is $200 off right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tour the White House's Christmas decorations on Google Street View]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now take a tour of the White House&#39;s halls decked with Christmas trees and other decor fit for the season — virtually, that is.

What you won’t find inside the box is a power adapter or USB cable. It’s up to you to supply those, so it’s not quite as affordable as its price would suggest. However, one nifty feature is that the internal batteries are user-replaceable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to IKEA to find out if the company plans to carry the Nordmärke portable Qi charger in the US. In the meantime, if you’re desperate to find a way to charge your devices on the go, your best bet is to buy a portable power bank. You can find ones that cost less than $20. What’s more, they will feature a bigger battery than the Nordmärke and they will charge your devices faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2889294c-c048-4b34-a1b7-62eecb3b928a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 20:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638567149</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T21:32:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6fc45e50-5480-11ec-99de-7614988bf1da" width="1344" height="907" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6fc45e50-5480-11ec-99de-7614988bf1da" width="1344" height="907" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BananimusPrime]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IKEA Nordmärke portable Qi charger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IKEA Nordmärke portable Qi charger ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Twitter CEO has already begun a 'major reorganization']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html">Jack Dorsey&#39;s recent departure on Monday</a>, Twitter&#39;s new CEO Parag Agrawal is wasting no time shaking up the company. A report from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-agrawal-restructuring/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> states that Agrawal announced a &quot;major reorganization of the company&quot; today, including exits by Michael Montano and Dantley Davis, who led <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemontano">engineering</a> and design, respectively.</p><p>Twitter confirmed the reorganization to Engadget. A spokesperson said &quot;Parag is focused on operational excellence and setting Twitter up to hit its goals; these changes were made with that in mind.&quot; The changes include moving to a &quot;General Manager model&quot; for teams in the product and technology organizations, which will mean having one person lead the work in those divisions. &quot;This will allow us to operate more cross-functionally and enable faster, more informed decision-making,&quot; the spokesperson added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Davis earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1466636819383025666">tweeted </a>a picture from a team offsite, saying: &quot;It was the highlight of the past two years at Twitter for me.

It also indicated that the &quot;reshuffling appears to primarily affect the company’s consumer, revenue, and core tech divisions, which will be helmed by Kayvon Beykpour, Bruce Falck, and Nick Caldwell, respectively.&quot;</p><p>In retrospect, there were hints that big changes at the company were underway.
