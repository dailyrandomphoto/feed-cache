With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-windows-10-review.html">Windows 10</a>, Microsoft had to make a big course correction from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-30-windows-8-review.html">Windows 8</a>, an ambitious yet flawed attempt at bringing PCs into the touchscreen era. Before that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-08-12-windows-7-review.html">Windows 7 </a>was meant as a palate cleanser to help us forget about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-01-30-windows-vista-review-roundup.html">bloated mess that was Vista</a>. Given that Windows 10 was already pretty polished when it launched, and only got better over time, why the need for a whole new version?</p><p>After testing early builds for months, as well as the shipping release this past week (here&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-get-windows-11-download-upgrade-microsoft-200010838.html">how to nab it yourself</a>), it&#39;s clear that Microsoft isn&#39;t actually trying to fix much with Windows 11. It&#39;s basically a fresh coat of paint on top of Windows 10 (and likely a last-ditch attempt at rebranding the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10x-dead-182353110.html">defunct Windows 10X</a>.) But the more I use it, the easier it is to see that small design tweaks can go a long way. Windows 10 was laser-focused on productivity; it aimed to make you as efficient as possible. Windows 11 goes a step further: What if being productive was also pleasant and oddly relaxing? Windows, meet mindfulness.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>What&#39;s new</strong></h2><p>At first glance, Windows 11 may seem like a radical departure from Microsoft&#39;s typical desktop template — an aesthetic that hearkens all the way back to Windows 95. The taskbar is still around, but now all of your icons are centered by default. The Start menu is back with a redesigned look featuring pinned and recommended apps (you can also hit All Apps to see everything you&#39;ve got installed). RIP, Live Tiles — nobody ever used you.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76a002c0-251d-11ec-bdff-1d60c07bfac1" alt="Windows 11 Widgets and edge" data-uuid="dac2ae5a-ab47-364e-8612-11b090917397"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>This refreshed look extends throughout Windows 11: App windows now have rounded corners; icons, Windows Explorer and the Settings app look sharper than ever; and even the sound effects have been cleaned up. This is Windows at its most refined. To put it uncharitably, though, it also seems a lot like macOS. But fret not, Windows diehards: You can still shove the entire taskbar back to the left side of the screen. (<em>Editor’s note</em>: Where it belongs.)</p><p>Microsoft has also reworked system tray, for better and worse. Hitting the date and time brings up your notifications and calendar, while clicking on the volume or networking icons makes the new action center pop out. It’s similar to the system shortcuts in Windows 10, allowing you to change Wi-Fi networks, enable airplane mode and quickly change your brightness and volume. You can also easily reach some accessibility tweaks, like enabling the magnifier or color filters. Everything looks sleeker than Windows 10, though some options are gone entirely, like the ability to turn Night Lite settings on and off.</p><p>Windows 11 also marks a major return for widgets: bite-sized apps that also appeared in Windows 7. You can reach them by hitting the widget button in the taskbar, but frankly, I found them useless. These days, I don’t need a glanceable screen for my calendar, news and mail, not when my smartphone is always within reach.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/49f11730-2524-11ec-af9e-57bd2e5e02d5" alt="Windows 11 " data-uuid="8193ac93-34fb-30b6-8df8-1002a4f53fba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Less noticeable than the taskbar changes, but still important, is the new Windows Store. It looks cleaner, with a left-hand navigation bar and multiple panes for individual app entries. I&#39;d wager Microsoft just wanted to keep those install and purchase buttons in clear view at all times. Windows 10 is also getting the same Store app eventually, so it&#39;s not really an exclusive for the new OS. Eventually, we&#39;ll also see Android apps in the Microsoft Store, but it&#39;s unclear when that&#39;s happening.</p><p>Similarly, Windows 11 ships with the latest Xbox app, but that&#39;s also available on Windows 10. You&#39;ll still want to upgrade for the best overall gaming performance, though, as Windows 11 will be the only way to use<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/24/windows-11-the-best-windows-ever-for-gaming/"> Microsoft&#39;s DirectStorage technology on PCs</a>. Whenever that does land it should dramatically speed up load times (assuming you have a compatible GPU and SSD) just like the Xbox Series S and X.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4a0b2ee0-2524-11ec-bef1-644685713d3c" alt="Windows 11 " data-uuid="75714b6e-d3bf-319f-be49-e95e98db2e15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><h2>Calm from the start... mostly</h2><p>On a new PC, Windows 11 welcomes you with a series of setup screens that feel like you&#39;re flipping through a spa brochure. Log into your Wi-Fi (or plug into Ethernet), enter your Microsoft credentials, and maybe grab a cucumber water while you wait.</p><p>As with Windows 10, you can choose to disable advertising IDs, which prevents ad tracking, and opt out of sending diagnostic information to Microsoft. But there aren&#39;t many other choices you&#39;ll have to make; the setup process basically runs on autopilot until you see the new desktop.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that Microsoft has made setup more restrictive for Windows 11 Home users: Both an internet connection <em>and</em> Microsoft account are required. You won&#39;t be able to set up a local user account, or use your computer at all, until you meet those requirements. Windows 11 Pro users won&#39;t have that limitation, which is good news for IT professionals and power users. But it could be frustrating for people without reliable internet access of their own.</p><p>(As of last year, the FCC said around 14.5 million Americans don&#39;t have steady broadband, defined as at least 25Mbps download speeds and 3Mbps uploads. Recent<a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/6-in-10-people-around-the-world-now-use-the-internet"> figures from Data Reportal</a> say around 40 percent of the world&#39;s population are offline. Microsoft is probably assuming that the majority of its potential customers won&#39;t have an issue finding internet, but that goes directly against the company&#39;s moves towards increased accessibility.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="e3d7c2ae43ef4d6a8c7851fb719891e5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4a0ae0c0-2524-11ec-bfde-a2b5b2a01baa" alt="Windows 11 "></section><p>I&#39;d expect many consumers will be upgrading their existing Windows 10 systems, rather than setting up a new computer. Unfortunately, Microsoft didn&#39;t have a way for me to upgrade my PC with a final Windows 11 release. Based on what I&#39;ve seen with the latest Windows 11 Insider previews, though, moving to the new OS appears to be very similar to installing a major Windows 10 update. On a Surface Laptop 4 I had lying around, the upgrade process took around 15 minutes after downloading the new OS via Windows update.</p><p>You&#39;re going to have a tougher time if you own an older PC that doesn&#39;t meet<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications"> Microsoft&#39;s hardware requirements</a>. You&#39;ll need a compatible Intel, AMD or Qualcomm processor; 4GB of RAM; and at least 64GB of storage. Also, you&#39;ll have to enable Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module), features that should make it harder for spyware and malware to attack your OS. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck">Microsoft&#39;s PC Health Check app</a> can help you see if your system is ready for Windows 11.</p><p>If you don&#39;t meet the upgrade requirements, you can download a Windows 11 ISO and install it manually, a method that bypasses Microsoft&#39;s CPU restrictions. Still, you&#39;ll need to be savvy enough to create a boot disk and deal with a more complex installation. Another caveat: manual installations may not receive some future Windows Updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee">according to <em>The Verge</em></a>. (It sounds like Microsoft hasn&#39;t decided how restrictive it wants to be just yet.)</p><p>If you&#39;ve built your own desktop PC, I&#39;d suggest bracing yourself for additional upgrade complications. Microsoft&#39;s Health Check app initially said that my system — powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X processor, an ASROCK motherboard and 32GB of RAM — wasn&#39;t compatible with Windows 11. It turned out I needed to enable the AMD TPM 2.0 module and Secure Boot in my BIOS. But once I did all that, my system couldn&#39;t boot into my Windows 10 installation.</p><p>After a bit of sleuthing, I learned that I needed to<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/change-an-mbr-disk-into-a-gpt-disk"> convert my Windows 10 installation disk</a> from MBR (Master Boot Record) to GPT (GUID Partition Table). So off I went into the command line to run some strings and pray for my Windows installation&#39;s safety. Five sweat-soaked minutes later, I rebooted and saw my trusty Windows login screen. Whew. From there, I was able to proceed with the Windows 11 Update as normal.</p><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one with a Windows 10 installation on an MBR disk — that was the standard on older computers — so I&#39;m hoping Microsoft eventually bakes that conversion into the entire Windows 11 setup process. I can&#39;t imagine average consumers trying to figure out command line prompts without wanting to throw their PCs out the window.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/49f70aa0-2524-11ec-bdbd-a1ba3ed8f774" alt="Windows 11 " data-uuid="a8464357-1301-3da4-8a01-c37bb41f38fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><h2>In use: A new look, new frustrations</h2><p>Windows 11 is nice to use. Pleasant, even. Windows 10 wasn&#39;t ugly, but Windows 11&#39;s focus on design leads to a more refined experience at first. I enjoyed having color-matched themes. The new Settings app is a dream; it&#39;s actually easy to find things for once! I genuinely love the new automatic window snapping, which lets you shove an app to a particular area of your screen by hovering above the maximize icon. Even better, snapping a few apps together creates a group that you can easily revisit in the taskbar.</p><p>That facelift doesn&#39;t come at the expense of performance, either. Windows 11 feels just as fast as Windows 10 on all of my test systems. But I&#39;ll be more interested to see how it performs on PCs older than five years, which is about the cut-off for Microsoft&#39;s upgrade requirements.</p><p>As impressed as I am by the design changes, a part of me feels constrained by the new OS. No matter where you place your taskbar icons, for example, you won&#39;t be able to see app labels anymore. Microsoft has been pushing an icon-focused taskbar since Windows 7, but you always had the option to turn on labels, so you could see what was in an app window before you clicked on it. Dealing with that loss is the single biggest hurdle I had with Windows 11.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d66dd8a0-252a-11ec-bfd5-78be7984bbd6" alt="Windows 11 Taskbar" data-uuid="b091785f-c7ce-3d0b-980a-ee89072ecb58"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now it takes me multiple clicks to find a specific Chrome window, or to locate an email I popped out of Gmail. Icons just aren&#39;t enough. I can understand why Microsoft took away labels: They make your desktop look chaotic. It&#39;s not nearly as zen as a simple line of high-resolution pictures.</p><p>But as a Windows user, I&#39;m used to chaos. I was shaped by the instability of Windows 3.11; I learned  to tame Windows XP as an IT admin; and I was there at the Windows 8 launch in Spain (an event that seems cursed in retrospect). Even after all of that, I&#39;m still primarily a Windows user. If chaos can make me more productive, I embrace the madness. Sadly, Windows 11 doesn&#39;t give me that option. It just wants me to relax, <em>damnit</em>.</p><p>To be fair, I have similar issues with macOS. As pretty as it is, finding a specific app window can be frustrating. To mitigate that, I typically rely on  Mission Control to establish hot corners that can either show me every open app, windows within a specific program, or the desktop. Windows 11 lets you set up a hot corner in the bottom right of your screen to show the desktop, but you&#39;ll have to rely on keyboard shortcuts to see open apps. (I&#39;m still debating whether Alt + Tab or Win + Tab is better.)</p><p>After spending so much time with Windows 11, I&#39;m begrudgingly getting the hang of the new taskbar, at least. I&#39;d bet some Windows diehards will be similarly frustrated with the new Start menu, especially if they&#39;re used to seeing all of their apps instantly. Personally, I find the focus on shortcuts and recently added files and apps to be more useful. And as of Windows 10, I just hit the Windows key and start typing to search for specific apps. (I&#39;m glad that&#39;s still practically instantaneous on the new OS.)</p><p>I’ve only dabbled in the Windows 11 touchscreen experience so far, but in general it feels easier to hit specific targets. Microsoft has also made apps more responsive to touch, so it’s being able to quickly expand and maximize windows feels less frustrating. You still won’t mistake Windows 11 for iPadOS, but I never expected Microsoft to go that far. This new OS is simply better for laptops that have touchscreens, and it’s far more usable for hybrid tablets like the Surface Pro.</p><p>While I&#39;ve found Windows 11 pleasant overall, I&#39;ll be interested to see how mainstream users react to all of the changes. Some members of Engadget&#39;s staff initially found the new design to be ugly (some warmed up to it later), and at least one was grateful I explained how to move the taskbar back to the left. It&#39;s tough for Microsoft to make any major changes to Windows without having users throw a fit. (Remember everything that happened around Windows 8?) So I expect the initial reaction isn&#39;t going to be welcoming. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m glad I&#39;m no longer in IT support for this transition.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/49f07af0-2524-11ec-abd7-da7b90e25a53" alt="Windows 11 " data-uuid="5a6fb551-532b-399b-b3d9-686c338d1dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><h2>So, who needs Windows 11?</h2><p>To paraphrase Thanos, Windows 11 is inevitable. It&#39;s going to start rolling out to eligible Windows 10 users today, and it will ship with new PCs this Fall. Aside from re-learning the taskbar and Start menu functionality, there&#39;s not much of a reason to avoid it. The new Secure Boot requirements will make it a safer OS overall; gamers will eventually get faster loading times; and everyone can appreciate the clean new aesthetic.</p><p>It&#39;s a step forward, even if it isn&#39;t as momentous as Windows 10. It&#39;s also hard to ignore the story behind the new OS, which makes Windows 11 feel more like a way for Microsoft to save face after an embarrassing failure. In the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html"> fall of 2019</a>, the company announced<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html"> Windows 10X</a>, an OS variant meant for dual-screened PCs. Those devices, like the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-surface-neo-duo-hands-on.html"> intriguing Surface Neo</a>, failed to arrive. (It&#39;s unclear if the complex new hardware was the roadblock, or if PC makers were waiting for Windows 10X to be completed.)</p><p>Microsoft announced last year that it was<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screen-175859033.html"> shifting the focus of 10X to single-screened devices</a>, and it put the final nail in the coffin this May, when it<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10x-dead-182353110.html"> said that Windows 10X development had stopped</a>. A few weeks later, we got word that Microsoft was<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-next-generation-june-24-162309239.html"> gearing up to reveal the next version of Windows</a>, and shortly after that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-leak-10x-microsoft-195643253.html">Windows 11 leak occurred</a>. On June 24th, with practically all of its new features spoiled, Microsoft<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-launch-microsoft-151140403.html"> officially revealed its new OS</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76a077f0-251d-11ec-97be-8a9ae6800570" alt="Windows 11 desktop" data-uuid="cdfae932-9ce0-3adf-b830-09d707ee049a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>In my head, I imagine the frantic meetings around Windows 10X&#39;s rocky development like something from <em>The West Wing</em> creator Aaron Sorkin. With dual-screened devices a no-show, maybe they could just repurpose that work for traditional laptops, a harried Panos Panay would say. But why even make that a separate version of Windows 10? The PC market is pretty hot right now, perhaps there&#39;s a way to capitalize on that? And at some point, someone just said &quot;Why not just go to 11?&quot; A stunned silence. Applause all around.</p><p>Not to sound too cynical, but releasing a new OS is an easy way to encourage people to buy new computers. That&#39;s particularly true now that we&#39;re relying on our PCs more than ever, as many people are still working and doing schoolwork from home. A new version of Windows is no simple thing, and it’ll surely get more headlines and media attention than a mere Windows 10 update. (Stares directly into camera.)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41922011-4483-43be-8207-e9516bf08df5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 20:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633370616</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T18:03:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76a09f01-251d-11ec-9459-61bd991f041d" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76a09f01-251d-11ec-9459-61bd991f041d" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 start menu]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How and when to upgrade to Windows 11]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11 is here</a> and Microsoft has detailed how the phased rollout will work.

The FTC filed a new complaint <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">in August</a>.

Even if Facebook is successful in getting the new FTC suit dismissed, the company is still facing numerous other investigations into its policies and practices.

So if you&#39;re listening to music from your computer and a call comes in on your phone, you can answer with a press of a button and use the built-in microphone. In addition, the SRS-NS7 has an IPX4 rating, meaning it&#39;s splash-proof.</p><p>As for the battery life, you&#39;ll get up to 12 hours of use out of a single charge, Sony says, and up to five hours of playback at maximum volume.

Starting next week, you’ll have the chance to earn XP by completing specific tasks in select games. Some of the titles that will support the feature out of the gate include <em>Rocket League</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-hades-early-access-believer.html"><em>Hades</em></a>, <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-4k-remaster-release-date-remedy-epic-games-store-xbox-playstation-130059237.html"><em>Alan Wake Remastered</em></a>, with more to come later in the year.</p><p>Epic’s system includes four tiers of achievements, with each level granting you a different amount of XP. For instance, in unlocking a bronze-level accomplishment, you’ll earn between five and 45 XP, while a gold one will net you as much as 200 XP. Once you accrue 1,000 XP in a single game, you’ll earn its platinum achievement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the update, Epic is also rolling out new pages where you can track and share the progress you’re making towards unlocking all the goals in a specific game. You’ll also see that information displayed through the library interface.</p><p>One thing to note is that this new system is different from the developer achievements Epic implemented about a year ago. That system will continue to be there for developers who don’t want to engage with the new one, though the company says it expects “this new system will roll out [to] all developers on the Epic Games Store in the coming months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-store-achievements-155410195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">777ebea2-96ed-4921-956b-c745368d9704</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:54:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633362855</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T15:54:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/355fcb40-2529-11ec-bdef-db60bb163a13" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/355fcb40-2529-11ec-bdef-db60bb163a13" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Epic Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Achievements]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Achievements ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin will fly William Shatner to the edge of space on October 12th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After decades of pretending to explore the universe in TV shows and movies, William Shatner is actually going to space.

But since they have a couple more bells and whistles when compared to the standard Fire Kids tablets, these slabs come at a premium. However, Amazon has discounted the entire lineup, so you can grab one of the tablets for as low as $60.

The latter also includes more content better suited for school-aged children rather than toddlers, including things like content from <em>National Geographic</em>, LEGO, Rabbids Coding and others. Kids Pro tablets also have a digital store in which parents can approve all apps purchases and downloads that their children request. That&#39;s on top of the standard parental controls that come with all Fire Kids tablets, making these slabs good options for parents that want to keep a close eye on what their children are doing while on their devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest difference between the various Kids Pro tablets is their screen sizes — 7-, 8- and 10-inch models are available, and unsurprisingly, the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro also has the most power. It runs on an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, and should last up to 12 hours on a single charge. While the Fire 7 Kids Pro is best for those with tight budgets, we&#39;d recommend upgrading to the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro for, at the very least, its USB-C charging port (the 7-inch tablet relies on a dated microUSB port).</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-fire-kids-pro-tablets-are-up-to-40-percent-off-right-now-140525814.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ab44063-60cd-4299-9393-dfc2692cae42</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:05:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633356049</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T14:00:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b274f6f0-251a-11ec-a1ff-68930f7548d0" width="1985" height="1323" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b274f6f0-251a-11ec-a1ff-68930f7548d0" width="1985" height="1323" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's shuffle play feature for Android is now available to everyone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in April, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-shuffle-play-feature-160057616.html">released</a> its Play Something feature for TV devices with the promise of making it available on mobile in the near future.

According to the streaming giant, users have been <a href="https://twitter.com/jengolbeck/status/1370218863741304840?s=20">loving</a> its shuffle play function for leading them to hidden gems they might not have found otherwise. Of course, the opposite could also be true if it turns out that Netflix&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t know you at all.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find the floating Play Something button at different places within the app, including the home screen. If you&#39;re viewing the page of a specific show, a button that says Play Something Else will show up. Patrick Flemming, Netflix&#39;s Director of Product Innovation, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Play Something helps Netflix members discover new shows and movies when they don’t want to make decisions. Today, we&#39;re excited to bring this feature to Android, too - choosing what to watch on your phone has never been easier.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition, Netflix is launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html">Fast Laughs</a>, its TikTok-style comedy feed that pulls funny clips from its catalog, for Android.

There are quite a few notable deals in this sale, two of which can help you store more games on your preferred console. Our favorite cheap SSD for the PS5, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:PNY&#39;s 4TB XLR8" href="https://amzn.to/2YhHVW8">PNY&#39;s 4TB XLR8 CS3040</a>, is down to a record low of $520, while <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Lexar&#39;s 1TB Play microSD card" href="https://amzn.to/3uEefhN">Lexar&#39;s 1TB Play microSD card</a> for the Nintendo Switch is nearly half off, bringing it down to an all-time low of $128.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3a5sjHS" id="f823caa52c7d4039b0e290830dc36ec2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop one-day storage sale at Amazon</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YhHVW8" id="95c2f83a3dd44c008918914fa322c488" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PNY XLR8 CS3040 (4TB) at Amazon - $520</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uEefhN" id="51723d7c24f44b5a971754d3306987a1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Lexar Play microSD card (1TB) at Amazon - $128</a><p>All variations of PNY&#39;s XLR8 internal SSD have been discounted in some way — you can pick up a 1TB version for $145 — but you&#39;ll get the best deal if you spring for the 4TB model. Even at its normal price of $700, it was the only high-capacity SSD we could thoroughly recommend in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">PS5 SSD guide</a> due to its comparatively low price. And while Lexar&#39;s Play microSD card can be used in other devices like tablets, it&#39;s a great option to add more storage to your Nintendo Switch thanks in part to its 150MB/s read transfer speeds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A couple of Crucial portable SSDs are included in this sale, too.

Case in point: The pothole featured in season 8 is literally <a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?">out of shot</a> to fit the show into the modern 16:9 widescreen format.</p><p>Cropped shows have always been an issue: <em>Seinfeld </em>has been on cable TV and Hulu with similar cropping. The popularity of Netflix has simply meant the show<em>&nbsp;</em>is getting more attention at this moment in time. There are solutions. When the entire run of <em>The Simpsons</em> hit Disney+, it was similarly squashed into widescreen.

As part of iOS 15, the latest App Store update lets you &quot;report a scam or fraud&quot; for both free, in-app purchase (IAP) and paid apps, provided you&#39;ve installed the app in question.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature, detailed by <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444814469184425988">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mazkewich/status/1444780501949194256">Richard Mazkewich</a> on Twitter, goes even farther than the previous &quot;Report a Problem&quot; feature. You can now signal a scam or a fraud and not just “Report suspicious activity,” “Report a quality issue,&quot; “Request a refund” or “Find my content” as before. Previously, you would have also needed to make an in-app purchase before you could highlight a scam or fraud, but that&#39;s no longer the case.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The &quot;Report a problem&quot; feature itself returned to individual app listings for the first time in years, as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out.

The new feature makes it easier to give, receive and even exchange presents for a gift card, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazons-new-mobile-shopping-feature-makes-gifting-convenient">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To do it, you just need browse for &quot;millions of products&quot; available to gift on Amazon&#39;s Shopping smartphone app, according to the company. Once you&#39;ve selected a product, you can select &quot;add a gift receipt for easy returns&quot; and go to check out.

Given that the show was filmed years before HD was a thing, it was originally displayed in a 4:3 aspect ratio on TV (and the DVD sets that came years later). But on Netflix, the show has been cropped into a 16:9 widescreen format to fit on modern TVs. As <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/seinfeld-netflix-aspect-ratio-1236110/">noted by Rolling Stone</a>, that means some visual gags have literally been erased.&nbsp;</p><div id="5630913ada3848beb644db652430aad7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">to emphasize, the titular pothole from the season 8 episode The Pothole is cropped out on Netflix <a href="https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS">https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS</a><a href="https://t.co/6G35eZQymW">pic.twitter.com/6G35eZQymW</a></p>— Brandon (spooky version) (@Thatoneguy64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Twitter users @boriskarkov and @Thatoneguy64 succinctly pointed out the problem with a specific episode called &quot;The Pothole.&quot; In the episode, George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld are trying to find George&#39;s lost keys, which were dropped in a pothole that was then paved over. In a crop where George wildly yells at the pothole, the Netflix crop removes the pothole entirely. The 16:9 aspect ratio probably also cuts out some other gags in the series — or at the very least, it might be a jarring experience for people used to how the show originally looked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, this isn&#39;t a new problem. Crops of <em>Seinfeld </em>have been on cable TV for years, and Hulu also showed the series in 16:9, as well. Given Netflix&#39;s popularity, <em>Seinfeld</em> is getting lots of extra attention right now, and thus a bunch of new viewers are probably checking it out who might not have seen it on Hulu. A similar controversy happened in late 2019 when the entire run of <em>The Simpsons </em>hit Disney+. After plenty of complaints about missed visual gags, Disney eventually released the seasons that aired in 4:3 in their original aspect ratio. Hopefully Netflix will do the same thing with <em>Seinfeld </em>— but in the meantime, as with many classic shows, the most authentic way to watch them is probably on DVD.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/seinfeld-netflix-hd-cropping-removes-jokes-183004013.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">71ad7beb-bb47-4a0a-8319-0c78ed09c4c8</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 18:30:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633277413</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T16:10:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/98ec7700-6534-11ea-bfdd-685e43e81484" width="2200" height="1595" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/98ec7700-6534-11ea-bfdd-685e43e81484" width="2200" height="1595" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Reuters Photographer / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld comments on the induction of the "puffy shirt" (R) into the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, in Washington November 18, 2004.

There have been plenty of rumors about a totally redesigned MacBook Pro coming out this fall, and the reliable Mark Gurman at <em>Bloomberg </em>reported in his Power On newsletter that an M1X-powered MacBook Pro will arrive &quot;in the next month.&quot; Apple has typically held Mac-focused events in October or early November; the first M1-based Macs were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-event-news-roundup-195533790.html">announced in early November of last year</a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/03/macbook-pro-m1x-release-date-information/">noted by <em>9to5Mac</em></a><em>, </em>Gurman predicts that there will be two M1X variants, both 10-core processors with eight high-performance cores and two efficiency cores. The difference between the two chips are in the graphics department — Apple may be offering an M1X with either 16 or 32 graphics cores.

The Studio Buds impressed us enough to give them a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">score of 84</a>, and we consider them to be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best Beats earbuds for most people</a>. They have a small, comfortable design with IPX4 water resistance, which will make them good companions during workouts. The sound quality is good with (unsurprisingly) punchy bass, and they support Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature, too. Active noise cancellation is good as well and it uses adaptive gain control to adjust in real-time based on the noises in your environment. While ANC use will affect battery life, you should be able to get five to eight hours of use on a single charge.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since they are technically Apple earbuds, the Beats Studio Buds have the H1 chip inside, allowing them to pair and switch easily between Apple devices. But Android users can also get some of that convenience now that the Studio Buds support Fast Pair, a feature which allows Android devices to quickly recognize the buds during the initial setup. The earbuds also work with Find My Device on Android, so you can always see their last known location.</p><p>There are a few downsides to the Studio Buds, though. Notably, their case doesn&#39;t support wireless charging, and they don&#39;t have onboard volume controls or sound customizations. However, Beats fans will likely overlook those shortcomings to get an attractive, reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a sound profile they&#39;re sure to enjoy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-discounted-to-125-new-record-low-price-amazon-133044728.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6cf319c7-851d-4d67-8f33-ff5ac89f2f13</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 13:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633267037</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T13:17:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5f940-ccb3-11eb-bdbf-a13df25bdcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5f940-ccb3-11eb-bdbf-a13df25bdcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds have a design with more universal appeal than its Powerbeats Pro.

They have decent sound and good wireless range, plus a solid five-hour battery life, too. But what sets any pair of AirPods apart is their fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. The H1 chip inside allows them to recognize which device you&#39;re actively using and switch to it, so you can go form taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac.</p><p>Aside from the AirPods Pro, the kicker in Amazon&#39;s sale is the wireless charging case — they originally cost $199 but have been hovering at $159 for months. The last time we saw them close to this $129 record low was in early August. And that means you&#39;re only paying $20 extra for the wireless charging case, which is a great deal.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-limited-time-sale-179-amazon-125010879.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68cda3f1-667f-42ac-bd45-ce69382af009</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 12:50:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633265414</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T12:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla sales continue to surge in the face of chip shortages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the third quarter of 2021 <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries">Tesla sold 241,300 cars</a>.

This is not to say that real conspiracies do not exist. Watergate, the tobacco companies’ collusion to obfuscate the link between cigarette smoking and cancer, and the George W. Bush–era NSA program to secretly spy on civilian Internet users are all examples of real-life conspiracies, which were discovered through evidence and exposed after exhaustive investigation.</p><p>By contrast, what makes conspiracy theory reasoning so odious is that whether or not there is any evidence, the theory is asserted as true, which puts it beyond all reach of being tested or refuted by scientists and other debunkers. The distinction, therefore, should be between actual conspiracies (for which there should be some evidence) and conspiracy theories (which customarily have no credible evidence). We might define a conspiracy theory as an “explanation that makes reference to hidden, malevolent forces seeking to advance some nefarious aim.” Crucially, we need to add that these tend to be “highly speculative [and] based on no evidence. They are pure conjecture, without any basis in reality.”</p><p>When we talk about the danger of conspiracy theories for scientific reasoning, our focus should therefore be on their nonempirical nature, which means that they are not even capable of being tested in the first place. What is wrong with conspiracy theories is not normally that they have already been refuted (though many have), but that thousands of gullible people will continue to believe them even when they have been debunked.</p><p>If you scratch a science denier, chances are you’ll find a conspiracy theorist. Sadly, conspiracy theories seem to be quite common in the general population as well. In a recent study by Eric Oliver and Thomas Wood they found that 50 percent of Americans believed in at least one conspiracy theory.</p><p>This included the 9/11 truther and Obama birther conspiracies, but also the idea that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is deliberately withholding a cure for cancer, and that the Federal Reserve intentionally orchestrated the 2008 recession. (Notably, the JFK assassination conspiracy was so widely held that it was excluded from the study.)</p><p>Other common conspiracy theories — which run the range of popularity and outlandishness — are that “chemtrails” left by planes are part of a secret government mind-control spraying program, that the school shootings at Sandy Hook and Parkland were “false flag” operations, that the government is covering up the truth about UFOs, and of course the more “science-related” ones that the Earth is flat, that global warming is a hoax, that some corporations are intentionally creating toxic GMOs, and that COVID-19 is caused by 5G cell phone towers.</p><p>In its most basic form, a conspiracy theory is a non-evidentially justified belief that some tremendously unlikely thing is nonetheless true, but we just don’t realize it because there is a coordinated campaign run by powerful people to cover it up. Some have contended that conspiracy theories are especially prevalent in times of great societal upheaval. And, of course, this explains why conspiracy theories are not unique to modern times. As far back as the great fire of Rome in 64 AD, we saw conspiracy theories at work, when the citizens of Rome became suspicious over a weeklong blaze that consumed almost the entire city — while the emperor Nero was conveniently out of town. Rumors began to spread that Nero had started it in order to rebuild the city in his own design. While there was no evidence that this was true (nor for the legend that Nero sang while the city burned), Nero was apparently so upset by the accusation that he started his own conspiracy theory that it was in fact the Christians who were responsible, which led to the prevalence of burning them alive.</p><p>Here one understands immediately why conspiracy theories are anathema to scientific reasoning. In science, we test our beliefs against reality by looking for disconfirming evidence. If we find only evidence that fits our theory, then it might be true. But if we find any evidence that disconfirms our theory, it must be ruled out. With conspiracy theories, however, they don’t change their views even in the face of disconfirming evidence (nor do they seem to require much evidence, beyond gut instinct, that their views are true in the first place). Instead, conspiracy theorists tend to use the conspiracy itself as a way to explain any lack of evidence (because the clever conspirators must be hiding it) or the presence of evidence that disconfirms it (because the shills must be faking it). Thus, lack of evidence in favor of a conspiracy theory is in part explained by the conspiracy itself, which means that its adherents can count both evidence and lack of evidence in their favor.</p><p>Virtually all conspiracy theorists are what I call “cafeteria skeptics.” Although they profess to uphold the highest standards of reasoning, they do so inconsistently. Conspiracy theorists are famous for their double standard of evidence: they insist on an absurd standard of proof when it concerns something they do not want to believe, while accepting with scant to nonexistent evidence whatever they do want to believe. We have already seen the weakness of this type of selective reasoning with cherry-picking evidence. Add to this a predilection for the kind of paranoid suspicion that underlies most conspiracy-minded thinking, and we face an almost impenetrable wall of doubt. When a conspiracy theorist indulges their suspicions about the alleged dangers of vaccines, chemtrails, or fluoride — but then takes any contrary or debunking information as itself proof of a cover-up — they lock themselves in a hermetically sealed box of doubt that no amount of facts could ever get them out of. For all of their protests of skepticism, most conspiracy theorists are in fact quite gullible.</p><p>Belief in the flatness of the Earth is a great example. Time and again at FEIC 2018, I heard presenters say that any scientific evidence in favor of the curvature of the Earth had been faked. “There was no Moon landing; it happened on a Hollywood set.” “All the airline pilots and astronauts are in on the hoax.” “Those pictures from space are Photoshopped.” Not only did disconfirming evidence of these claims not cause the Flat Earthers to give up their beliefs, it was used as more evidence for the conspiracy! And of course to claim that the devil is behind the whole cover-up about Flat Earth could there be a bigger conspiracy theory? Indeed, most Flat Earthers would admit that themselves. A similar chain of reasoning is often used in climate change denial. President Trump has long held that global warming is a “Chinese hoax” meant to undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturing.</p><p>Others have contended that climate scientists are fudging the data or that they are biased because they are profiting from the money and attention being paid to their work. Some would argue that the plot is even more nefarious — that climate change is being used as a ruse to justify more government regulation or takeover of the world economy. Whatever evidence is presented to debunk these claims is explained as part of a conspiracy: it was faked, biased, or at least incomplete, and the real truth is being covered up. No amount of evidence can ever convince a hardcore science denier because they distrust the people who are gathering the evidence. So what is the explanation? Why do some people (like science deniers) engage in conspiracy theory thinking while others do not?</p><p>Various psychological theories have been offered, involving factors such as inflated self-confidence, narcissism, or low self-esteem. A more popular consensus seems to be that conspiracy theories are a coping mechanism that some people use to deal with feelings of anxiety and loss of control in the face of large, upsetting events. The human brain does not like random events, because we cannot learn from and therefore cannot plan for them. When we feel helpless (due to lack of understanding, the scale of an event, its personal impact on us, or our social position), we may feel drawn to explanations that identify an enemy we can confront. This is not a rational process, and researchers who have studied conspiracy theories note that those who tend to “go with their gut” are the most likely to indulge in conspiracy-based thinking. This is why ignorance is highly correlated with belief in conspiracy theories. When we are less able to understand something on the basis of our analytical faculties, we may feel more threatened by it.</p><p>There is also the fact that many are attracted to the idea of “hidden knowledge,” because it serves their ego to think that they are one of the few people to understand something that others don’t know. In one of the most fascinating studies of conspiracy-based thinking, Roland Imhoff invented a fictitious conspiracy theory, then measured how many subjects would believe it, depending on the epistemological context within which it was presented. Imhoff’s conspiracy was a doozy: he claimed that there was a German manufacturer of smoke alarms that emitted high-pitched sounds that made people feel nauseous and depressed. He alleged that the manufacturer knew about the problem but refused to fix it. When subjects thought that this was secret knowledge, they were much more likely to believe it. When Imhoff presented it as common knowledge, people were less likely to think that it was true.</p><p>One can’t help here but think of the six hundred cognoscenti in that ballroom in Denver. Out of six billion people on the planet, they were the self-appointed elite of the elite: the few who knew the “truth” about the flatness of the Earth and were now called upon to wake the others.</p><p>What is the harm from conspiracy theories? Some may seem benign, but note that the most likely factor in predicting belief in a conspiracy theory is belief in another one. And not all of those will be harmless. What about the anti-vaxxer who thinks that there is a government cover-up of the data on thimerosal, whose child gives another measles? Or the belief that anthropogenic (human- caused) climate change is just a hoax, so our leaders in government feel justified in delay? As the clock ticks on averting disaster, the human consequences of the latter may end up being incalculable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-how-to-talk-to-a-science-denier-lee-mcintyre-mit-press-153022138.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6a650b27-8319-4b64-ab3f-3a6f43d8028e</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 16:15:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633331900</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T07:18:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0fd84c60-200d-11ec-8a4f-d0a2a2ab42b1" width="4700" height="3634" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0fd84c60-200d-11ec-8a4f-d0a2a2ab42b1" width="4700" height="3634" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[wildpixel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Climate change denier concept as a dying sick tree shaped as a human head with a long nose as a surreal environmental metaphor and conservation symbol for global warming disinformation with 3D illustration elements.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Climate Change Denier Concept]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
