The Pentagon said it “initiated contract termination procedures” in a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2682992/future-of-the-joint-enterprise-defense-infrastructure-cloud-contract/">press release</a> it shared on Tuesday, noting “the Department has determined that, due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”</p><p>With JEDI, the Defense Department had planned to modernize its IT infrastructure, but the contract hadn’t moved forward since the Pentagon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-jedi-dod-azure.html">awarded it to Microsoft in 2019</a> on account of a legal challenge from Amazon. One month after JEDI went to Redmond, Amazon filed a formal challenge with the US Court of Federal Claims, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html"><ins>alleging the Pentagon showed “unmistakable bias”</ins></a> when it evaluated the two companies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the lawsuit was eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-amazon-jedi-lawsuit-trump-vendetta.html">unsealed later that same year</a>, it came out that Amazon believed it lost the contract due to interference from former President Donald Trump. According to the company, Trump “used his power to ‘screw Amazon’ out of the JEDI Contract as part of his highly public personal vendetta against Mr. Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post.”</p><p>Following an internal audit, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html">released a report</a> that said it found no evidence that the Trump Administration had interfered with the procurement process. At the same time, it noted that several White House officials did not cooperate with the probe. As such, it could not definitively determine whether the administration had affected the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the Defense Department announced it wasn’t moving forward with JEDI, Microsoft published a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/06/microsofts-commitment-to-the-dod-remains-steadfast/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> on the decision. “We understand the DOD’s rationale, and we support them and every military member who needs the mission-critical 21st century technology JEDI would have provided. The DOD faced a difficult choice: continue with what could be a years-long litigation battle or find another path forward,” the company said. “The security of the United States is more important than any single contract, and we know that Microsoft will do well when the nation does well.”</p><p>Microsoft went on to say the episode highlights the need for lawmakers to look at the challenge process. &quot;The 20 months since DOD selected Microsoft as its JEDI partner highlights issues that warrant the attention of policymakers: when one company can delay, for years, critical technology upgrades for those who defend our nation, the protest process needs reform,&quot; it said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve reached out to Amazon for its response to the development, and we’ll update this article when we hear back from the company.</p><p>Alongside the cancelation, the Pentagon announced a new multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). The agency plans to collect proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft. It contends they&#39;re the two vendors best suited to meet its needs, though it also plans to see if other companies can help it modernize its IT infrastructure. The Defense Department <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and other outlets during a call that it expects to award the first direct JWCC contracts in 2022, with the procurement process to open more broadly as soon as 2025. It also said the litigation with Amazon wasn&#39;t the primary reason for the cancelation of JEDI. “The mission needs have been our primary driver on this,” John Sherman, the DOD acting chief information officer, said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17859900-103e-4897-9ce3-6883ce0518f5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625594038</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T17:54:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeremy Christensen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's neck speakers are back and now they're for remote workers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just when you think Sony doesn’t have any more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-05-20-sony-rolly-finally-brings-the-party-stateside.html">weird and fanciful designs</a> left in it, the company surprises you. Building on devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-sony-immersive-wearable-speaker-hands-on-srs-ws1.html">SRS-WS1</a>, it announced the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-introduces-the-srs-nb10-wireless-neckband-speaker-the-ultimate-work-from-home-companion-301325627.html"><ins>SRS-NB10</ins></a> on Tuesday. It&#39;s a neckband speaker the company says it designed with remote workers in mind. Set to cost $150 when it goes on sale later this year, the NB10 promises up to 20 hours of audio playback “optimized for your ears alone” with drivers that are angled upward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cc2b1440-de74-11eb-a27c-dda354014ee3" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Sony SRS-NB10" data-uuid="a190e2e5-09a4-3c88-aad3-d8189d7b72b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>As long as you’re listening to something at a relatively low volume, Sony says you “don’t need to worry about distracting colleagues, roommates or family.” But let’s be real here, you’re wearing a speaker on your shoulders. That’s the kind of energy that’s matched only by the co-worker who insists on bringing their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-60-percent-keyboards-160038272.html">mechanical keyboard</a> to work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SRS-NB10 isn&#39;t only a speaker, however. You can also use it for voice and video calls. Thanks to two beamforming microphones and its built-in voice processing technology, Sony claims the NB10 will make it easy for people on the other end of a call to hear you. What’s more, the “open-ear” design makes it so that you can hear what’s going on around you.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26af88b0-de75-11eb-bfef-ddcbf805d216" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="SRS-NB10" data-uuid="f3b5c5c4-d888-325b-9bfa-fcb7dab9d1fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The NB10 can connect to two Bluetooth-capable devices simultaneously, allowing you to switch between them as needed. Should you have the courage to wear the NB10 to say the gym, they’re also IPX4-certified water-resistant. And thanks to USB-C charging, you can get an additional hour of playback after 10 minutes at the outlet.</p><p>The SRS-NB10 will be available in two colors — charcoal grey and white — when it goes on sale in September.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-srs-nb10-neckband-speaker-163433147.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a97b3641-421a-415a-b36f-317ad7dcf183</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 16:34:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625588998</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T16:30:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/bd013e40-de74-11eb-b6bf-4ea27ffed530" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/bd013e40-de74-11eb-b6bf-4ea27ffed530" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony SRS-NB10]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony SRS-NB10]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's next State of Play will focus on 'Deathloop']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s next State of Play showcase will focus on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/deathloop"><em><ins>Deathloop</ins></em></a>, the upcoming PlayStation 5 console exclusive from Arkane Studios.

It stated that Muse Group will collect users&#39; personal data and possibly share that information with third parties, including law enforcement and potential buyers. That led to claims from users that the software was becoming &quot;spyware.&quot;</p><p>The company has <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>attempted</ins></a> to clear up the controversy, which it says is primarily down to &quot;unclear phrasing in the Privacy Policy,” as <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/audacity-spyware-claims"><em><ins>Music Radar</ins></em></a> reported. Muse Group says it will only collect &quot;very limited&quot; data (operating system version, processor type, IP address and opt-in error reports) from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Audacity"><ins>Audacity</ins></a> users. Users&#39; IP addresses are stored in a readable format for 24 hours before they become &quot;pseudonymized and irretrievable.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Muse Group added it will only share data if required by a court in a jurisdiction in which it operates. It won&#39;t hand over user information following a law enforcement request or otherwise sell or share data. The data collection is &quot;a standard policy requirement for providing services in many jurisdictions, regardless of the depth of data collected or nature of service,&quot; the company said.</p><p>&quot;We do understand that unclear phrasing of the Privacy Policy and lack of context regarding introduction has led to major concerns about how we use and store the very limited data we collect,&quot; Muse Group&#39;s head of strategy Daniel Ray <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>wrote on GitHub</ins></a>. The company is working with its legal team on a revised, clearer version of the policy, which it plans to publish soon.</p><p>The limited data collection is necessary because of two new features in the upcoming version of Audacity, according to Ray: a way to automatically check for updates, and the optional error reporting. Ray didn&#39;t address a privacy policy request for users aged under 13 not to use the app. The General Public License under which Audacity is distributed doesn&#39;t allow restrictions on the use of software.&nbsp;</p><p>The updated privacy policy does not apply &quot;to offline use of the application,&quot; so if you block Audacity&#39;s access to the internet, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. The policy will only come into force with the next version of the software, 3.0.3. Current and older versions don&#39;t have any networking features and they won&#39;t collect any data.</p><p>At best, this was a case of miscommunication which caused concern among Audacity users.

But just like Apple&#39;s and Samsung&#39;s flagships, the 9 Pro doesn&#39;t come cheap with a starting price of $1,070. But Amazon has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:9 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3qNVYNf">9 Pro</a> for $100 less right now, bringing it down to $970 — the cheapest we&#39;ve seen it since launch. And if you want to spend even less, the regular <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:OnePlus 9" href="https://amzn.to/3jPgrjg">OnePlus 9</a> is on sale for $650, or $80 off its normal price.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy OnePlus 9 Pro at Amazon - $970" href="https://amzn.to/3qNVYNf">Buy OnePlus 9 Pro at Amazon - $970</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy OnePlus 9 at Amazon - $650" href="https://amzn.to/3jPgrjg">Buy OnePlus 9 at Amazon - $650</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> impressed us with its comprehensive set of features and (for the most part) it&#39;s excellent cameras. While slimmer than previous models, the 9 Pro doesn&#39;t look drastically different than other OnePlus smartphones and that&#39;s a good thing. It has a lovely 6.7-inch, 3,216 x 1,440 AMOLED display that supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate and a brightness up to 1,300 nits. OnePlus also includes a bunch of customizable screen settings that can help you do things like get the best mobile gaming experience or increase battery life when necessary. The IP68-rated handset also has dual speakers, a microSIM card slot and one Warp Charge-compatible USB-C port.</p><p>OnePlus collaborated with Hasselblad on the 9 Pro&#39;s rear camera array, which includes a 48-megapixel main camera, 50MP ultra-wide lens and an 8MP telephoto lens. Overall, the system produces lovely images with true-to-life colors, and it&#39;s capable of shooting video in up to 8K 30fps. Our biggest gripe was with the telephoto lens, which had a tendency to take overexposed images in bright environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, we had no complaints about the OnePlus 9 Pro&#39;s performance. It runs on a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&#39;s very little that combination of specs can&#39;t handle. The 9 Pro&#39;s highly responsive display only helps the smartphone feel ever fast, too. Battery life is also quite good as the dual 4,500mAh cells lasted at least a full day without breaking a sweat, and you&#39;ll get even more juice out of them if you leave the display on Full HD.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-deal-100-off-amazon-143951540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efe996b4-fb72-4435-84a3-4bb35df4b66e</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:39:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625582422</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T14:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/28f16030-de66-11eb-957b-dba7de21ab89" width="2400" height="1390" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/28f16030-de66-11eb-957b-dba7de21ab89" width="2400" height="1390" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The premium OnePlus 9 Pro is $100 off at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Batters in the Home Run Derby will livestream using 5G helmet cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to see a pro baseball player&#39;s at-bat through their eyes, you&#39;re about to get your chance. T-Mobile is marketing its 5G network by equipping players at the 2021 Home Run Derby with 5G point-of-view cameras on their helmets, including the catchers&#39; masks. Watch the live competition through a <a href="https://www.t-mobilebeyondthebases.com/#/">special T-Mobile website</a> and you can witness both batting practice and the derby itself as if you were on the field, with 5G (hopefully) keeping everything in sync.</p><p>The event kicks off July 12th, starting with practice at 6:30PM Eastern and the derby itself at 8PM. The POV cameras are also coming alongside a new MLB AR mobile app to explore Coors Field in 3D and get detailed stats for each swing. People with 5G phones will also get extra stats like hang time and exit velocity, although this is clearly just an incentive to upgrade your device. You don&#39;t need 5G to get a few extra numbers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The footage is &#39;only&#39; in HD, and it&#39;s not clear which players will have 5G cameras. T-Mobile says they&#39;ll have three or four hat cameras during batting practice, and then they&#39;ll have two during the derby (one for the American League, one for the National League) in addition to a catcher camera. If all goes well, though, you&#39;ll see what it&#39;s like for stars like Shohei Ohtani when they knock one out of the park. Look at it this way — even if the cameras are limited, this is one of the few 5G tie-ins that&#39;s more than just a gimmick.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-mlb-home-run-derby-5g-player-cameras-142640402.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6d92706-0954-41d1-93a9-8c0d0beeb6cf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:26:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625591399</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T17:10:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c34de5e0-de34-11eb-b6fd-3c0499abca08" width="6937" height="4624" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c34de5e0-de34-11eb-b6fd-3c0499abca08" width="6937" height="4624" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Shirey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANAHEIM, CA - JULY 05:  Shohei Ohtani #17 of the Los Angeles Angels singles during the game between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium on Monday, July 5, 2021 in Anaheim, California.

While it was already a tempting gadget for those looking to save energy and make their homes smarter, Google sweetened the deal by pricing the thermostat at $130. It has since gone on sale a few times, but today you can grab the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:snow color option" href="https://amzn.to/2UroLem">snow color option</a> for $88, which is 32 percent off its normal price and a record low. Also, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:snow Thermostat with a Trim Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3ytWBhG">snow Thermostat with a Trim Kit</a> is on sale for $103, or $12 less than the other Trim Kit packages. <a href="https://amzn.to/3yqfhyK">Other colors are down to $100</a>, which is the same sale price we saw back in April <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-thermostat-amazon-deal-111504158.html">around Earth Day</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nest Thermostat at Amazon - $88" href="https://amzn.to/2UroLem">Buy Nest Thermostat at Amazon - $88</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nest Thermostat + Trim Kit at Amazon - $103" href="https://amzn.to/3ytWBhG">Buy Nest Thermostat + Trim Kit at Amazon - $103</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Compared to previous Nest thermostats, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-thermostat-2020-redesign-google-home-130-specs-pre-order-140039186.html">this one</a> is slimmer, has a touch-sensitive edge and a mirrored display that both looks lovely and automatically wakes up when you approach it. In addition to looking better than most conventional thermostats, the Nest Thermostat is much smarter as well, allowing you to control via on-device controls, Google&#39;s Home app and even with Assistant or Alexa voice commands. The device itself has a redesigned controller view too, which makes it easier to quickly set the temperature in your home.</p><p>But the automatic features are likely the biggest selling points for a device like the Nest Thermostat. It recognizes when you&#39;ve left your home and will automatically go into Eco mode, keeping your home at a specific temperature until you return when it will either raise or lower the temperature based on your preferences. This Nest Thermostat also has Savings Finder, a feature that continuously looks for ways to reduce your energy bill throughout the year. For example, the device will suggest adjustments based on weather conditions — think reducing your home heat usage during a particularly warm winter — that you can choose to accept in order to potentially decrease your energy costs. Although a smart thermostat like Nest&#39;s takes a bit more installation that a standard smart light bulb, it&#39;s a good entry point into the smart home world — and it&#39;s even better when on sale like this.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-thermostat-sale-amazon-daily-deal-134858109.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea53682f-b743-47c6-938b-56a6d1b61dd4</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 13:48:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625579382</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T13:49:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/3b81b9a0-9921-11eb-abe7-fb12ee5f322a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/3b81b9a0-9921-11eb-abe7-fb12ee5f322a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nest Thermostat]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nest Thermostat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing's wireless earbuds will offer ANC for $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nothing is borrowing a strategy from its founder Carl Pei&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carl-pei-leaving-oneplus-235552807.html">previous gig at OnePlus</a>: dribbling technical details ahead of a product launch.

After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-new-switch-oled-rumor.html">years of rumors</a>, the company has at last confirmed the existence of a new Switch model with an OLED display. It&#39;ll cost $349.99 and arrive on October 8th.</p><p>As expected, the latest model has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-4k-022740993.html">a larger, seven-inch screen</a>. The 720p OLED display, which Nintendo claims is more vivid, is a step up from the 6.2-inch LCD screen on the original Switch. The console has significantly reduced bezels and 64GB of storage, while the dock has a wired LAN port.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nintendo is promising &quot;enhanced audio&quot; with the new Switch, which works with all existing Joy-Con controllers. The company is offering it in the traditional neon red/blue color scheme with a black dock, or in a white/black color scheme with a white dock.</p><div id="8e504f7d12674aa38c51c8cac3ea4058"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The new Switch also has what looks like a <em>massively</em> improved kickstand that spans the entire width of the back of the console. It can be propped up at any angle and looks far sturdier than the tiny, fragile piece of plastic that propped up the old Switch.</p><p>However, there&#39;s no 4K output, as reports had widely suggested. You&#39;ll still only play at a maximum resolution of 1080p in docked mode. Nor has Nintendo said it will upgrade any other parts of the Switch. The OLED device was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-upgraded-oled-switch-will-reportedly-use-an-nvidia-gpu-082107049.html">rumored</a> to use NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS tech with an upgraded chip. The company also warned that tweaks such as the larger screen mean the new Switch might not work as neatly with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-02-nintendo-labo-vr-review-cardboard.html">Nintendo Labo products</a>.</p><p>The original Switch is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-is-selling-way-more-switches-than-it-predicted-083640962.html">selling like hot cakes</a>, so there’s a case to be made that Nintendo didn&#39;t need to upgrade the console just yet. But the original Switch&#39;s display and huge bezels are starting to look a little bit dated in 2021; this OLED screen should modernize the experience significantly. That said, for people who want to save some cash, Nintendo will continue selling the original Switch, at least for now.</p><p>It&#39;s highly likely that demand will far exceed supply. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-second-console-144551868.html">told investors</a> in a call in May that the company was still contending with shortages and production issues. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">current global scarcity of semiconductors</a> will also limit production capacity. So, the new Switch might be even harder to find than the current console has been at various points.</p><p>Since it released the original Switch in 2017, Nintendo has issued a revised model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-nintendo-switch-upgraded-battery-life.html">with a battery upgrade</a>.

Despite decrying the competitive nature of the free-to-play gaming market, the company isn&#39;t giving up on those titles it deems successful.

The notorious con-man pretended to be Russian oligarch Simon Leviev, the son of Russian-Israeli diamond mogul Lev Leviev. He would take his victims — mostly Scandinavian women — on trips via private jets, stay with them in luxury hotels and treat them to expensive dinners. In truth, he&#39;s an Israeli man named Shimon Hayut, who fled to Europe twice to escape theft, forgery and fraud charges in his home country.&nbsp;</p><p>Online dating scams have been fairly common these past years, with con-artists using every available outlet into finding potential victims.

The highlight feature of the company&#39;s new Seoul earbuds is a mode toggle that Urbanista claims reduces Bluetooth latency to about 70ms. A dedicated latency toggle isn’t something we’ve seen on a lot of true wireless headphones. Most gaming-oriented earbuds use Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html">aptX Bluetooth codec</a> to get latency as low as possible.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43c4a0a0-ddb9-11eb-b736-0c4bdb031a57" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Seoul" data-uuid="9b3ff420-36d0-3eca-9065-df36a8d90925"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>With the codec’s low-latency variant, Qualcomm claims you get that number down to about 40ms. The downside of aptX is both your earbuds and phone need to support the codec. That’s not a problem with most Snapdragon devices since Qualcomm makes those too, but you won’t find the codec supported on Apple devices. That’s what makes the Seoul earbuds interesting. They give you a device agnostic way to get a low-latency mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that feature, the Seoul earbuds are about what you expect from a pair of mid-range true wireless earbuds in 2021. At $89.90, they feature a claimed eight hours of battery life on a single charge, with the included case allowing you to get another 32 hours of playtime before the entire unit needs to recharge. At that point, you can charge them using either a USB-C cable or Qi charging pad.  They’re also IPX4-certified, come with Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and feature both Google Assistant and Siri integration. Urbanista will sell the Seoul earbuds in four colors: black, blue, purple and white.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/09f791c0-ddb9-11eb-9fff-0accef854609" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Lisbon" data-uuid="9f482045-319c-3af0-aae6-e16cd856821d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>For those looking for something more affordable, Urbanista also announced its new Lisbon earbuds. At $49.90, they’re the company’s cheapest true wireless earbuds to date. Looking at the spec sheet Urbanista sent over, they look decent too. Battery life comes in at a claimed nine hours on a single charge. With the included charging case, you can get a total of 27 hours of playtime from them. They don’t feature waterproofing, but you do get Bluetooth 5.2 support and USB-C charging, as well as Google Assistant and Siri integration. They’ll come in five colors: pastel red, beige, pink, green and black.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-seoul-gaming-true-wireless-earbuds-announcement-080005653.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b610cde-d2a7-4a14-9f8b-2e6b2fc52900</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625508380</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T18:06:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c810b070-ddb8-11eb-bbce-f6abe0192847" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c810b070-ddb8-11eb-bbce-f6abe0192847" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Urbanista]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urbanista Seoul]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urbanista Seoul]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bumble is opening a restaurant to help people date IRL again]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With more and more people getting fully vaccinated against <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19">COVID-19</a>, many single folks are ditching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-bumble-online-experiences-virtual-dates-130012757.html">virtual dates</a> for in-person ones.

The open-source software is now collecting user data for &quot;app analytics&quot; and &quot;improving our app&quot; as well as &quot;for legal enforcement.&quot;</p><p>The privacy policy was updated on July 2nd, following Muse Group&#39;s <a href="https://mu.se/newsroom/tpost/6dhedma301-muse-group-acquires-audacity-expanding-c">acquisition</a> of Audacity in April — Muse Group also owns Ultimate Guitar and notation app MuseScore. As reported by <a href="https://fosspost.org/audacity-is-now-a-spyware/"><em>Foss Post</em></a>, the policy notes Muse Group is collecting details about users&#39; operating system version, processor, country based on IP address, crash reports and non-fatal error codes and messages. According to the policy, processing that data is in the &quot;legitimate interest&quot; of the company &quot;to offer and ensure the proper functioning of the app.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The data it collects on law enforcement grounds is more vague. The policy says Muse Group will capture &quot;data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities&#39; requests (if any).&quot; It may share personal data with &quot;any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary.&quot; Data may be shared with potential buyers too.</p><p>Users&#39; personal data is stored on servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, Muse Group is &quot;occasionally required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our external counsel in the USA.&quot; Muse Group noted that whenever personal data is &quot;transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in accordance with [the European Union&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a>].&quot;</p><p>The policy states users&#39; IP addresses are &quot;stored in an identifiable way&quot; for a day before they&#39;re hashed. That leaves users open to identification through law enforcement or government data requests.</p><p>Several other points in the privacy policy have raised some eyebrows, including asking under-13s not to use Audacity. That, as <em>Foss Post</em> notes, may violate the license under which Audacity is distributed. The General Public License prohibits restrictions on software use. Engadget has contacted Muse Group for comment.</p><p>All is not lost for Audacity users who value their privacy and pre-teens who tinker with audio in the app. Some users have been <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213">calling for</a> a fork of the software, a new version of the app based on the source code. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the community take Audacity in that direction.</p><p>Until that fork arrives, privacy-conscious users might want to find alternative software, or at least block Audacity from accessing the internet. After all, it&#39;s a desktop app that doesn&#39;t have any tangible online functions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audacity-privacy-policy-spyware-accusations-data-collection-210001803.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06062508-3fd8-452a-96b6-f2b247d41c60</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 21:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625582569</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T14:43:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook, Google and Twitter threaten to leave Hong Kong over privacy law changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tech companies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-hong-kong-stops-data-requests-134700801.html">at odds with the Hong Kong government</a>, and that tension appears to be on the rise.

Pro-democracy activists doxxed police officers and others frequently during the 2019 protests, and there&#39;s a worry that the revised laws could be worded loosely enough that merely sharing a photo of someone in a public space could get both sharers and tech companies in trouble. It could be harder to hold police accountable for violence, or to criticize officials for anti-democratic policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-twitter-may-leave-hong-kong-190015028.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efc886ff-321b-481f-8aa4-c0d3980ac903</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 19:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625492497</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T13:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[d3sign via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bugatti joins forces with electric hypercar maker Rimac]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electric hypercar company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rimac"><ins>Rimac</ins></a> is taking control of Volkswagen’s supercar brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bugatti"><ins>Bugatti</ins></a> as part of a joint venture with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Porsche"><ins>Porsche</ins></a> (which VW owns).

Now, scientists from <a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2021/novel-microscopy-method.html">UT Southwestern</a> have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01175-7">developed</a> a new &quot;simple and cost-effective&quot; device capable of capturing multi-angle photos that can be retrofitted onto existing lab microscopes. The team say their solution — which involves inserting a unit of two rotating mirrors in front of a microscope&#39;s camera — is 100 times faster than converting images from 2D to 3D.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, this process involves collecting hundreds of photos of a specimen that can be uploaded as an image stack into a graphics software program, which then performs computations in order to provide multiple viewing perspectives. Even with a powerful computer, those two steps can be time-consuming. But, using their optical device, the team found they could bypass that method altogether.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s more, they claim their approach is even faster as it requires only one camera exposure instead of the hundreds of camera frames used for entire 3D image stacks. They discovered the technique while de-skewing the images captured by two common light-sheet microscopes. While experimenting with their optical method, they realized that when they used an incorrect amount of de-skew the projected image seemed to rotate.</p><p>&quot;This was the aha! moment,&quot; said Reto Fiolka, assistant professor at the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics at UT Southwestern. &quot;We realized that this could be bigger than just an optical de-skewing method; that the system could work for other kinds of microscopes as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>Using their modified microscope, the team imaged calcium ions carrying signals between nerve cells in a culture dish and looked at the circulatory system of a zebrafish embryo. They also rapidly imaged cancer cells in motion and a beating zebrafish heart. They also applied the optical unit to additional microscopes, including light-sheet and spinning disk confocal microscopy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microscopes-3d-images-cells-170004411.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ceb9ee1e-7839-4a55-838c-3a5d017f7537</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625504888</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T17:08:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW Pics via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Optic microscope with a blood smear sample.

The researchers used a membrane distillation process that resulted in 99.9 percent salt rejection for one month. If commercialized, they say the solution could help alleviate the drinking water crisis exacerbated by climate change. More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/26/more-than-3-billion-people-affected-by-water-shortages-data-shows">3 billion</a> people worldwide are affected by water shortages, with the amount of fresh water available for each person plunging by a fifth over two decades, according to the UN.</p><p>The new study details a way to purify sea water using a a nanofiber membrane as a salt filter. While scientists have used membrane distillation in the past, they kept encountering a massive obstacle that slowed down the process. If the membrane became too wet, or flooded, it could no longer reject the salt. Needless to say, this was a time-draining process that forced scientists to either wait for the membrane to dry or come up with additional solutions, like using pressurized air to release trapped water from its pores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To overcome this challenge, the Korean team turned to a nano technology known as electrospinning to create their three-dimensional membrane. In scientific terms, they used poly vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene as the core and silica aerogel mixed with a low concentration of the polymer as the sheath to produce a composite membrane with a superhydrophobic surface. In essence, this created a filter that had a higher surface roughness and lower thermal conductivity, allowing it to desalinate water for up to 30 days. The full report was published in the <em>Journal of Membrane Science.</em></p><p>“The co-axial electrospun nanofibre membrane has strong potential for the treatment of seawater solutions without suffering from wetting issues and may be appropriate for real-scale membrane distillation applications,” Dr Yunchul Woo, a materials scientist at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, said. He added that the membrane may be appropriate for &quot;pilot-scale and real-scale membrane distillation applications.”&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the main method of purifying sea water is through reverse osmosis at the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html">20,000</a> desalination plants around the world. But these facilities require vast amounts of electricity to operate and also create concentrated <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/desalination-plants-produce-twice-as-much-waste-brine-as-thought">brine</a> as a waste product, which is typically dumped back in the sea. Therefore, it&#39;s no wonder scientists are exploring new solutions that aren&#39;t as counter-productive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nanofiber-membrane-drinking-water-150039679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a14a0633-0280-4cd7-bcef-fe4bb4a7766b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 15:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625481855</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T10:44:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elsevier]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Membrane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[membrane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Intergrade’s entertaining DLC should also be on PS4]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> is a little confusing, if the name didn’t give it away.

Sadly, you can only play Intermission with a PS5.</p><p>In <em>Remake</em>, each character had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-final-fantasy-7-remake-preview.html">unique playstyle in battle,</a> and that’s still true in Intermission. Yuffie’s battle style switches between long- and close-range fighting. She’ll hurl her oversized shuriken at enemies, and then either close the distance for melee attacks, or launch magical elemental attacks from afar, with the shuriken acting as a sort of lightning rod.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a young, out-of-town ninja, Yuffie also brings a healthy dose of sass and attitude to a game (and characters) that can take everything a little too seriously. The results are often hilarious. When you take on secondary characters from Remake in Fort Condor mini-games, she’ll talk smack to the likes of Jessie, Roach and Kyrie. At points, it’s borderline tone-deaf: Jessie may have just sent her friends, part of anti-Shinra group Avalanche, to their deaths. But from the perspective of Yuffie, she doesn’t know that, and when she crushes the anxious Avalanche member in a board game, the ninja doesn’t hold back.</p><section data-eng-breakout="655ff1edcd8f4a09957e2a3ae03e8ddc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc462110-d991-11eb-beae-355c192c530b" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade"></section><p>Soon into the first chapter, Yuffie is joined by a new character, Sonon. He acts as a close-range tank, distracting enemies from Yuffie who’s more easily damaged. While he’s an uncontrollable support character, and will choose his own movement and enemies to attack, you can still order him to attack with skills or equipped magic from the battle menu.</p><p>This leaves Yuffie able to deal damage safely from a distance; she has the ability to mete out elemental attacks without having to equip the necessary materia (orbs that add magic and skills to characters), able to attack weak points without tinkering much with your loadout. You can also bolster Sonan with materia, making him a more tempting lure to enemies, or just amping up his hit points to ensure he survives more often than not. Sonon also has a convenient resurrection skill that triggers if Yuffie gets KOed, ensuring you’ll center your fight strategies around letting Sonon draw the enemy’s attacks, while Yuffie attacks weaknesses and shoots across the area for enemy crowd control.</p><p>I’m impressed Square Enix was able to eke out yet another completely different fighting style for this DLC chapter — and this bodes well for the subsequent four characters that were party members in the PSOne’s <em>Final Fantasy 7.</em> In the original, barring stats and limit break attacks, characters were blank slates which you loaded out with materia to offer more attack options. In the Remake, they move and attack almost completely differently, demanding different playstyles when you switch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc4e1050-d991-11eb-bf6e-2a028996f9ae" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="074940c7-3c3b-398e-bd5f-2430bb3b1aff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There’s a PS5 version of Remake, too. Given that <em>FF7R</em> was a recent exclusive to the PS4, the changes aren’t groundbreaking but they’re certainly noticeable. I took issue with the grainy land and skyscapes you’d see from the detailed areas in <em>FF7R</em>, and in Intergrade, the resolution has been increased and detail improved. Things that the internet went to town on, like those <a href="https://kotaku.com/ffvii-remake-doors-look-much-better-on-ps5-1847062520">atrociously rendered doors</a>, have been fixed.</p><p>In Intergrade, you can now switch between performance (60fps fixed) and graphics (4K, more graphical flourishes) modes. The former is a revelation during your battles across both the game and the Intermission chapters, as your team fluidly moves around enemies. It feels easier on the eyes and just more satisfying to play. The original <em>Remake</em> (I hate having to write that) didn’t choke too often, but sometimes all the pyrotechnics and detailed boss battles did take its toll on framerates on the fourth-generation PlayStation. There&#39;s also a new photo mode in <em>Intergrade</em>, making it easier to captures some beautiful stills from what is a gorgeous game. I&#39;ve added my favorite shots at the bottom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721311-d991-11eb-bf9d-f253c81ac19d" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="5ecd8276-3aa0-3b2f-b7ff-4a23b50b6511"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There are some other PS5 upgrades, too. Yes, the DualSense’ haptic feedback occasionally kicks in but you’ll rarely notice it. I was only reminded of the difference during the motorcycle chase during the base game, where you can literally feel the texture of parts of your tarmac. Besides that and Cloud’s occasional memory flashes, no other times really stood out where the controller was offering me any extra immersive rumbles. As you might also expect, the loading speeds are also hugely improved: loading your saved game, or hopping between chapters are both incredibly swift.</p><p>One of the big criticisms leveled at Intermission is that these new chapters are playable only on the PlayStation 5 — if you’ve been able to buy one. But do the environments, battles and rambunctious ninjas demand next-gen console hardware?</p><p>Only Square Enix knows for certain, but I don’t think so. The PS4 would have struggled to keep up with Yuffie’s battle style, which sees her shooting across the battlefield after her oversized shuriken. There are other parts, as you navigate levels, that seem to be there expressly to showcase how smoothly the PS5 can handle a ninja hurtling down a mechanized fire pole, with scaffolding, levels and items shooting past — all backed by a five-track jazz arrangement. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-soundtrack-154531230.html">I&#39;m not joking</a>.</p><p>Right at the start of the Intermission chapters, Yuffie gingerly steps through a gap — one of the in-game slow-downs familiar to anyone that’s played <em>Remake</em> on the PS4. This seems to happen only once in the new parts of Midgar introduced in Intermission. It’s almost a knowing nod that things are going to speed up. And they do: the second chapter takes a few darker turns, and at times turns into a gauntlet of punishing battles that are both challenging and entertaining. Complete the Intermission chapters, and a secret optional battle in the core game, too. I won’t spoil it for you.</p><p>For those that haven’t played <em>FF7R</em> yet, <em>Intergrade</em> is the definitive version, and the DLC is worth a playthrough, but it’s a shame that the Intermission chapters aren’t playable on the PS4. It turns what is a very polished piece of DLC into a slightly hollow cash grab.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721310-d991-11eb-bff7-6ef8e2843f1a" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="0368a07a-b38c-3064-97d2-db52aa276dc5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc98ade0-d991-11eb-941f-97b99817bc8c" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="892853bb-2170-3de6-ae7a-3b0859cb0414"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc5d79a0-d991-11eb-93ff-94d59874336b" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="ef737803-fc2f-312e-8578-41808ff0c70a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc7ac5a0-d991-11eb-be36-20999a20f1dc" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="e42de189-6269-3c0b-8724-252e0953132c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bcc451c0-d991-11eb-bf7f-08b19ef7e3d8" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="9a9ccabf-260d-3c01-8ece-0df33cef7bb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-intergrade-intermission-review-130017993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca267352-e1fb-4038-b5e8-db075940baab</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 13:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625250217</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T18:23:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721315-d991-11eb-beff-0ff55c7021a2" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721315-d991-11eb-beff-0ff55c7021a2" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Intergrade]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Intergrade]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
