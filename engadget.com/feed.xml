Savathun is also known as the &quot;Queen of Lies&quot; and &quot;The Deceitful Sister,&quot; which certainly have a connection with that &quot;survive the truth&quot; line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="758871e5730c49e989e05b4eeb4d742b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/MJatd9B1Vk">pic.twitter.com/MJatd9B1Vk</a></p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1412773438834499587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Bungie has been planting the seeds for a bigger focus on Savathun in recent months, following years of teases about the character. Season 14 has seen the Vex imposing <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Endless_Night"><ins>The Endless Night</ins></a> upon the Last City, and (spoiler warning) it seems Savathun was behind it all. That gives credence to rumors Savathun will be the main villain in <em>The Witch Queen</em> expansion.</p><p>What&#39;s more, the studio said in February that it would have more to share about &quot;<em>The Witch Queen</em> and beyond&quot; in late summer. The timing of the showcase matches up with that.</p><p>Earlier this year, Bungie <a href="https://www.engadget.com/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-delayed-201543867.html"><ins>delayed </ins><em><ins>The Witch Queen</ins></em><ins> to 2022</ins></a>, partly because of the impact of COVID-19. The studio had long been thinking about shifting its annual expansions to the first half of each year anyway, &quot;primarily for the health of the team.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/destiny-2-will-finally-get-crossplatform-support-sometime-in-2021-090004355.html"><ins>cross-play is slated to go live</ins></a> alongside Season 15. We might learn more details about that important change during the showcase. The current season is <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheSplicer">scheduled to end</a> on the day of the event. Season 15 should start soon afterward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-destiny-2-showcase-the-witch-queen-154638767.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">785203ba-e7f8-4d18-87c5-44222e3412f9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 15:46:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625672815</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T15:47:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/db4af490-df37-11eb-bff7-8c124912697e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/db4af490-df37-11eb-bff7-8c124912697e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bungie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Destiny 2 showcase]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 showcase]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump is suing Twitter, Facebook and YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-lawsuit-facebook-twitter-82323cf3-b8ce-48ed-8cab-cafe31f0bae7.html">As expected</a>, former President Donald announced on Wednesday he plans to file lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as the CEOs of each respective company. Trump announced the legal bid at a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, promising the case would lead to an &quot;end of the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and the canceling that you know so well.&quot; Trump and his lawyers, many of whom he said come from the to tobacco industry, plan to file the lawsuits in the Southern District of Florida and hope to obtain class action status with each one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Trump alleges the tech giants violated his First Amendment rights and even calls Facebook a &quot;state actor&quot; in one of the suits. The lawsuit against Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai names YouTube as a defendant. &quot;Our case will prove this censorship is unconstitutional,&quot; Trump said, adding that he plans to seek punitive damages from each of the companies. The decision to file the suits in Florida may prove an early roadblock for Trump. As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1412795910430527489?s=20"><em>Reuters</em></a>, both the Facebook and Twitter note in their terms of service that any case brought against them must done so at select courts in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the January 6th US Capitol riot, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">Facebook</a> suspended Trump from their respective platforms. &quot;We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,&quot; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. The action comes more than two months after Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board said the company&#39;s suspension of the former president was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">appropriate</a>.&quot; Facebook currently plans to uphold the ban until at least January 2023.

The Linux Foundation will manage the project and form an Open 3D Foundation to foster development. Amazon is a founding member alongside tech heavyweights like Adobe, Huawei, Niantic and Red Hat.</p><p>While the original Lumberyard was based on the Crytek engine, the version you&#39;ll get as Open 3D Engine was rewritten and is free of possible patent headaches, according to Amazon. It also boasts a new, more photorealistic renderer as well as many of the other tools you&#39;d need to build a game or simulation, including an animation system, a content editor and visual scripting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is relatively untouched ground for developers. They don&#39;t always have to pay for engines, but they rarely have full freedom to modify the code for their own ends — and those that do often keep the modifications for themselves. Open 3D Engine not only allows extensive customization, but will encourage creators to contribute to the wider community. That theoretically strengthens the technology and helps it move faster than commercial tech like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html">Unreal Engine</a> and Unity.</p><p>There is a financial incentive for Amazon, though — open source may be its best chance at fostering growth. Amazon hasn&#39;t had much success with in-house games built on Lumberyard, having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-crucible-003348633.html">cancelled <em>Crucible</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-new-world-august-31-202202548.html">delayed <em>New World</em></a>. The shift to Open 3D Engine could spur adoption and encourage studios to use AWS, Twitch and other services that hook into the platform. Amazon could reap the rewards of Open 3D Engine even if its dreams of becoming a AAA game creator never come to pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lumberyard-game-engine-open-source-150615764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4de1c90-ce96-4616-8dc8-2867331543ad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 15:06:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625672877</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T15:48:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still from Amazon's Lumberyard video game.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Lumberyard game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW's futuristic electric scooter is straight out of anime]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we saw <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/11/11/bmw-ce-04-scooter-concept/">BMW&#39;s CE 04 electric scooter concept last year</a>, it looked like something pulled straight out of a science fiction film. Now the company has unveiled the <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0337029EN/the-new-bmw-ce-04">final consumer version of the CE 04</a>, and while it&#39;s lost a bit of the fantastical edge, it still looks like a vehicle that would be right at home in <em>Akira </em>or <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. Aimed at the urban commuter, the CE 04 features a 10.25-inch LCD screen (that&#39;s bigger than what&#39;s in most cars!), up to 81 miles of range, and a top speed of 75mph. It&#39;ll be available in 2022 for around $16,000. That&#39;s twice the price of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-27-vespa-electric-scooter-on-sale-october-elettrica.html">Vespa Elettrica</a>, but that&#39;s also a far slower vehicle meant for even more casual users.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="ae0e2b5f-818d-4e75-af5e-2fc740d56bbf"/><p>Just looking at the CE 04 makes it clear what BMW is trying to accomplish. It&#39;s a fresh new design that&#39;s meant to entice people who are interested in EVs, but may not have the money or space for an actual electric car. It can charge with a regular power plug or EV cables, and BMW claims it can quick charge after being completely drained in one hour and 40 minutes with a level 3 power connection. Still, even if you don&#39;t have the fanciest charging setup around, BMW says it can juice up in four hours and 20 minutes with a standard household socket.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While we&#39;re still waiting for more details on the CE 04&#39;s pricing and optional accessories, you can expect to see a reduced output model with a range of around 62 miles (100Km). That cheaper model will also spit out between 15hp and 30hp, whereas the standard one can reach up 42hp. Both versions should be well equipped for city traffic though, with the ability to reach 31mph in 2.6 seconds.&nbsp;</p><div id="f3767166ffce432ca6c1c72f14e34ae8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VRmsR-SsRs?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-ce-04-electric-scooter-144505285.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16a32cdd-9585-42af-88c7-12fc8d4a41f2</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:45:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625668804</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T14:40:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grubhub and Yandex bring autonomous deliveries to US college campuses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/grubhub">Grubhub</a> is teaming up with Russian tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/yandex">Yandex</a> to deliver food to students and others on US college campuses with the help of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-yandex-autonomous-delivery-robots-testing-moscow.html">autonomous robots</a>.

Instead of playing mostly by yourself in one historical period, you&#39;d routinely join other players across &quot;multiple settings&quot; that would grow and evolve over time. You&#39;d have a reason to keep playing (and keep paying) for a long time where AC currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-siege-of-paris-dlc-200711445.html">relies heavily on DLC</a> and frequent sequels to stay fresh.</p><p>While there would be individual games tied to <em>Infinity</em> with their own look and feel, they&#39;d all be linked together, the sources said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise">confirmed</a> that <em>Infinity</em> exists, but wouldn&#39;t explain the game in detail. It&#39;s meant to please fans who want a &quot;more cohesive approach&quot; to the game universe, the company said.</p><p>Upheaval at the company might threaten the project, however. Ubisoft recently unified its Montreal and Quebec City teams to help Assassin&#39;s Creed flourish through shared talent. While that could strengthen the quality of each release, Quebec will lead the franchise — a problem when that studio and Montreal have had bitter rivalries at times.</p><p>More importantly, there are concerns Ubisoft hasn&#39;t fully addressed the misconduct claims that led to the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-misconduct-151932648.html">firing its chief creative officer</a> and certain studio leaders. A spokeswoman said Ubisoft had investigated all claims and taken appropriate actions, but <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s contacts said that managers accused of abuse remained in senior roles and that employees were reporting racism and sexism that wasn&#39;t being addressed.</p><p>That, in turn, could limit Ubisoft&#39;s resources for <em>Infinity</em>. While poaching from studios near Ubisoft Montreal is a problem, misconduct claims have also lead to more staffers jumping ship from that location.

You don&#39;t get a 4.5K Retina Display like you do with the latest iMacs, but that&#39;s not a huge deal if you have a monitor that you already love — plus your preferred keyboard and mouse setup as well.</p><p>Aside from its compact size, this Mac Mini&#39;s biggest draw is the new M1 chipset, which has proven to be blazing fast on every machine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">we&#39;ve tested</a> with it. Switching between apps is a breeze, systems wake almost instantaneously and playing Apple Arcade games won&#39;t make the Mac Mini break a sweat. It&#39;s also worth noting that the Mac Mini M1 comes with an 8-core GPU, which is slightly better than the 7-core GPU on the base iMac.</p><p>Apple focused on the internals here, so the exterior design of the Mac Mini hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s still a sleek square on which the back edge houses all of its ports: an Ethernet connector, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 connector, two USB-A ports and a headphone jack. That&#39;s another perk of the Mini when compared to the new iMac, which only has two or four Thunderbolt ports depending on the configuration. Overall, Amazon&#39;s sale is a good opportunity for those with aging desktops to get an M1 machine as a replacement for less.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-sale-600-with-coupon-amazon-124557506.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fbf62f0-8480-4be5-841f-c27066cc6645</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:45:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625661983</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:46:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bentley's Flying Spur Hybrid can travel 25 miles in EV mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bentley-plugin-hybrid-ev-2026-094121635.html">announcing</a> a shift to hybrid and fully electric cars by 2026, Bentley has begun showcasing the existing vehicles getting an eco-friendly makeover. Following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-bentley-bentayga-hybrid-revealed-163000296.html">Bentayga Hybrid</a> SUV, the spotlight is now on the more powerful <a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234">Flying Spur</a> sedan.&nbsp;</p><p>Bentley&#39;s second plug-in hybrid features a 410 break horsepower (bhp) 2.9-liter V-6 with twin turbochargers, paired with a 134 bhp electric motor, for a combined 536 bhp. That&#39;s 95 bhp more than its SUV counterpart. While the luxury vehicle&#39;s 0-60mph acceleration time of 4.1 seconds and top speed of 177mph is just shy of the standard Flying Spur V8.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e8f69fc0-df1b-11eb-bef7-786d6bababbc" alt="Bentley Flying Spur Hybrid" data-uuid="ec36cc6b-432f-36c5-947a-467b955bc850"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bentley</div></figure><p>To improve emissions, the new engine uses fuel injectors and spark plugs centralized within each combustion chamber for &quot;optimal spray patterns.&quot; While the twin-scroll turbos and catalytic converts are positioned within the V of the engine.</p><p>Bentley says the Flying Spur packs a 14.1kWh battery to offer an expected all-electric range of around 25 miles, pending certification. With many city centres requiring hybrids to switch to full EV mode, those figures will be critical. Some car makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fiat-chrysler-plug-in-hybrids-electric-only-mode-161611941.html">Fiat</a> and BMW have even developed tech that can fully switch hybrids to all-electric drive in low emissions zones.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to that feature, Bentley says the hybrid manages battery usage by automatically shifting between three drive modes, including EV, allowing it to store up energy for when you reach the city. The sedan&#39;s combined petrol-electric range is more than 435 miles.</p><p>Visually, little separates the new plug-in hybrid from the rest of Flying Spur range, apart from a charging port on the left rear wing and an understated hybrid badge on the front. As you&#39;d expect, this is a car for the uber-rich. Prices for the Flying Spur Hybrid are expected to start from an eye-watering £160,000 in its native UK, according to <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bentley/flying-spur/355476/new-bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-arrives-536bhp"><em>Auto Express</em></a>, with sales beginning this summer and deliveries to kickstart before the end of the year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-ev-121920123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10d9ea49-5001-4a0f-9a5e-6e03f47b2b3f</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:19:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625660991</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:30:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bentley]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Bentley Flying Spur plug-in hybrid drives down a highway with hills in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bentley Flying Spur]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian hackers breached a GOP contractor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A state-sponsored Russian hacking group infiltrated the computer systems of a Republican National Committee (RNC) contractor over the weekend. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>originally revealed that the RNC suffered a breach at the hands of prolific hackers APT29, aka Cozy Bear, who are believed to be behind a spate of high-profile cyberattacks on the US and its allies.&nbsp;</p><p>However, GOP officials were quick to refute that report, interjecting that the actual victim was a third-party IT services provider known as Synnex.

Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">the OLED Switc</a>h is the most grown-up-looking Switch so far, with smaller bezels, a new off-white dock and matching Joy-Cons. The core upgrade is — shockingly — the screen: a new seven-inch OLED panel that should offer crisper graphics when played as a handheld. However, the resolution hasn’t changed, so it’s been stretched a little wider than the original 6.2-inch LCD Switch.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7c4907c0-df0a-11eb-b7e7-9d56957bd6b0" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="28c45b18-421b-3e11-a8ac-0189c30dd752"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure></a><p>I can run through the rest of the changes, as there aren’t all that many. There’s now 64GB of internal storage — another grown-up upgrade — while a wider, more solid-looking kickstand replaces the flimsy plastic tab on the original Switch. You can adjust this to multiple angles for more comfortable table-top / airplane-tray-table gaming. The new off-white dock also has an Ethernet port built-in, while the core OLED Switch has improved speakers. Otherwise, there’s no newer processor and, seemingly, no battery-life improvements. (The company hasn’t offered any battery estimates yet on its official site.)</p><p>The OLED Switch is not for current Switch owners looking to upgrade — although I don’t doubt some of us will buy one. It’s a refined version of the original (or maybe I’m easily tricked by monochrome color schemes), but seems expressly aimed at handheld players, who are the ones that’ll benefit from the bigger OLED screen. That’s odd when the cheaper, non-hybrid Switch Lite was geared at the same crowd.</p><p>Nintendo could have squashed the more aggressive rumors of a powerful version capable of 4K and upscaled gaming, but it didn’t. Because it’s Nintendo, meaning it has a mercurial vision for hybrid consoles, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-160029843.html">iconic games</a>, detachable controls and, at the same time, ignores Bluetooth audio support and in-game chat functionality. And there was no mention of any changes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-european-union-151738223.html">fix Joy-Con drift</a>.</p><p>If you’re looking for a comparison from console history, consider this a GameBoy Pocket-style twist on the GameBoy, rather than a more powerful PS4 Pro to replace the PS4.</p><p>And will we ever see the 4K-capable Switch Pro? Does it even exist? Only Nintendo knows.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">President Biden will order the FTC to draft &#39;right to repair&#39; rules</a></h2><h3>The policy will probably target farmers more than phone companies.</h3><h3></h3><p>The right to repair movement in the US could soon see a significant breakthrough.

The short-form video app has begun allowing some users to pay creators for custom clips in the vein of startup Cameo. With Big Tech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-190201529.html">copycats</a> in hot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-creators-fund-100-million-172643630.html">pursuit</a>, it seems TikTok isn&#39;t against the idea of borrowing features itself, as long as they help it to maintain its grip on Gen Z. For now, only users in Turkey and Dubai appear to have access to the test, according to social media posts spotted by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-appears-to-be-testing-a-cameo-like-shoutouts-feature?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>BuzzFeed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The new feature is reportedly called &quot;Shoutouts&quot; and essentially lets you request and pay for a video from a creator using TikTok coins, the in-app currency purchased with real money and used to tip others. It seems creators can set a rate for their services, with the final product delivered to your inbox. In all, your custom video could take longer than a week to arrive as TikTok appears to be reviewing the clips first. After all, it doesn&#39;t want the feature to become the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/content-creator-suing-thothub-copyright-onlyfans-160301130.html">OnlyFans</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok seemingly views shoutouts as way for users to request happy birthday greetings and pep talks from popular creators. Though, it&#39;s currently unclear how many followers a person needs to have in order to make money from shoutouts. Based on the ingenuity of its talent base, you can probably expect some of the results to be more creative than direct-to-camera chats.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok isn&#39;t the only social app emulating Cameo. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-super-cameo-clone-021440553.html">Facebook is also working on &quot;Super,&quot;</a> a service that lets users pay to interact with influencers in live streams. Meanwhile, Cameo is doing gangbusters, according to its management. Last year, the video requests service raked in gross revenue of $100 million, 75 percent of which was paid to talent, reports <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/cameo-steven-galanis-celebrity-videos-1234908473/"><em>Variety</em></a>. That was up 4.5 times from 2019, with the app&#39;s celeb users delivering 1.3 million shoutouts in 2020 alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameo was recently valued at <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/after-new-funding-found-cameo-is-a-1-billion-company/#:~:text=The%20startup%20raised%20%24100%20million,B%20led%20by%20Kleiner%20Perkins.">$1 billion</a> after raising $100 million from the venture capital arms of Google, Amazon and Japanese tech giant SoftBank.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-cameo-pay-custom-videos-085759889.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e5d1ab6-b9c3-425d-8b71-37f225ad509a</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 08:57:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625648480</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T09:01:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ca49c0f0-deff-11eb-a85b-70fa594aeab1" width="1280" height="761" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ca49c0f0-deff-11eb-a85b-70fa594aeab1" width="1280" height="761" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams Together Mode test lets just two people start a meeting]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of pandemic lockdowns last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-new-team-features-fight-video-conferencing-fatigue-175708665.html">launched</a> Together Mode for its Teams workplace  messaging app in an effort to help attendees feel more connected. To use the mode, a meeting should have five participants at the very least, but it looks like the tech giant is looking to make it available even for calls with fewer attendees.

Its purpose is to make people feel like they&#39;re all sitting in the same room and to help them see the other participants&#39; nonverbal cues. The NBA gave fans a look at what the feature can do by using it to recreate the atmosphere of a packed arena without anyone being physically there.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In December, a few months after the mode rolled out, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-together-mode-skype-192645916.html">made its way to Skype</a> so that friends and family can use it for their video calls, as well. Even then, though, it had a five-participant minimum, which likely limited its use. Making it accessible to fewer participants could encourage people to use it more frequently. Users can switch to Developer Preview by clicking the ellipsis next to their profile picture in Teams and going to the About section. However, some organizations could switch the option off, making it unavailable to their personnel.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-fewer-participants-together-mode-on-teams-071243818.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad531f9d-0349-4039-b570-228afed69d9d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 07:12:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625645180</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T08:06:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e46f0020-deec-11eb-9dee-0e75047663b6" width="6481" height="4320" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e46f0020-deec-11eb-9dee-0e75047663b6" width="6481" height="4320" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Prostock-Studio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emotional young asian lady having video call with friends, using laptop and headset at home, cheerfully talking and gesturing, closeup, copy space.

That means the next <em>Jurassic World</em> and the new <em>Halloween</em> movie will make their TV debut on the streaming service also owned by its parent company Comcast. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/universal-moves-hbo-peacock-streaming-service-1235012751/"><em>Variety</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/universal-pictures-deepens-ties-to-peacock-streaming-service-in-new-movie-deal-11625603414"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Universal&#39;s films will appear exclusively on Peacock for streaming within four months after their theatrical release, as well as within the final four months of an 18-month window.&nbsp;</p><p>Those 10 months in between, the films will be licensed to around two to three additional partners, though none of them will have exclusive rights to the movies. Universal has yet to release the list of additional partners, and it&#39;s unclear if HBO is one of them. <em>Variety</em> says that by adopting the segmented TV release schedule, Universal is hoping to avoid over-saturation or making its films seem stale. In addition, streaming platforms are apparently willing to pay top dollar for popular movies these days in an effort to stand out from their ever-increasing number of rivals out there.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether the move leads to a boost in subscriber numbers for Peacock remains to be seen.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/biden-wants-farmers-to-have-right-to-repair-own-equipment-kqs66nov"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, President Joe Biden will “in the coming days” direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to draft new regulations to empower consumers to repair their devices on their own and at independent shops.</p><p>While there aren’t many details on the executive order just yet, it will reportedly mention phone companies as a possible target of regulation. However, farmers are expected to be the primary beneficiary. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usAy410bAYY">Tuesday&#39;s White House briefing</a>, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the order would give them &quot;the right to repair their own equipment how they like.” White House economic adviser Brian Deese said on Friday that<em>&nbsp;</em>the order is broadly designed to drive “greater competition in the economy, in service of lower prices for American families and higher wages for American workers.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Over the years, states across the US have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-19-tech-companies-are-trying-to-crush-mom-and-pop-repair-shops.html">tried to pass right to repair legislation</a>. However, companies like Caterpillar, John Deere, and Apple have consistently lobbied against those efforts, claiming they would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-apple-repair-costs.html">put consumers at risk</a> by compromising the security and safety of their devices. And to date, no state has passed legislation that makes it easier for consumers to repair their products independently. As <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epn5mk/biden-to-sign-executive-order-granting-farmers-right-to-repair-protections?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_campaign=210706"><em>Motherboard</em> notes</a>, Biden’s order will mark the first time a president has weighed in on the issue.</p><p>&quot;Big tech has been taking advantage of consumers for too long, at the expense of local small businesses. We&#39;re very encouraged that the Biden administration is planning to use the rulemaking power of the FTC to restore competition,&quot; a spokesperson for iFixit told Engadget when we reached out to the company to ask about the order.&nbsp;</p><p>The move comes as support for the right to repair movement builds in other parts of the world. In 2020, the European Commission said it would introduce legislation to push manufacturers to create products that are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-eu-right-to-repair-phones-tablets-computers.html">easier to repair and reuse</a>. That same year, the European Parliament voted to direct the Commission to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/47111/european-parliament-votes-for-right-to-repair?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ifixit%2Fblog+%28iFixit%29">develop and introduce a mandatory labeling system</a> that assigns a reparability score to products.</p><p>We’ve reached out to the Consumer Technology Association, which represents electronics manufacturers, for comment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 6:00PM ET</strong>: Added comment from iFixit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e0e1f34a-6782-4a41-8a7d-901f49c42c9b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 21:13:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625645003</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T08:03:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d184fc0-de9c-11eb-8a37-1fac6ecc3e51" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d184fc0-de9c-11eb-8a37-1fac6ecc3e51" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aziz Taher / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A technician repairs an iPhone at the Class cellphone store in Beirut, Lebanon July 6, 2017.

The first of those features would make it easier for those with protected accounts to make their tweets publicly viewable in instances where they want to reply to non-followers. “If you have a protected account and reply to someone who isn’t following you, you may not know they can’t see your reply,” Lena Emara, Twitter people experience designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/LenaEmara/status/1412458812863299592?s=20">wrote in a thread</a>. So one idea is to include a prompt that reminds people of that fact, as well as give them the option to easily switch their tweets to public.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/560ab770-de8d-11eb-a7df-ac7ad80954de" alt="Twitter Replies concept" data-uuid="4e74df9c-817d-3585-b5f6-b954cb0bc347"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Another potential feature would help those with multiple accounts. A mockup Emara shared shows an interface element that would allow you to switch to a different account directly from Twitter’s main composition window. What’s more, the new interface would allow you to see, at a glance, the name, handle and privacy status of your accounts all in one place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two other concepts Emara shared focus more on privacy. One of those details a feature that would periodically touch base with users to see if they’re happy with their current discoverability and conversation settings and make it easy to tweak them as needed without visiting the app’s settings menu. Lastly, the second one would create a system for notifying you when people search for your username and give you more control over whether your account is discoverable that way. That’s something that could be significant for limiting online harassment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/86318780-de8d-11eb-b77e-c1838b72203e" alt="Twitter concept 2" data-uuid="fbf64a4b-22cc-39bd-bf06-f69f75673686"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>As with the last time Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-concept-200046070.html">showed off several concept features</a>, everything you see above “are just ideas and not being built (yet?).” They may never mature into features the company ships.

The Pentagon said it “initiated contract termination procedures” in a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2682992/future-of-the-joint-enterprise-defense-infrastructure-cloud-contract/">press release</a> it shared on Tuesday, noting “the Department has determined that, due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”</p><p>With JEDI, the Defense Department had planned to modernize its IT infrastructure, but the contract hadn’t moved forward since the Pentagon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-jedi-dod-azure.html">awarded it to Microsoft in 2019</a> on account of a legal challenge from Amazon. One month after JEDI went to Redmond, Amazon filed a formal challenge with the US Court of Federal Claims, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html">alleging the Pentagon showed “unmistakable bias”</a> when it evaluated the two companies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the lawsuit was eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-amazon-jedi-lawsuit-trump-vendetta.html">unsealed later that same year</a>, it came out that Amazon believed it lost the contract due to interference from former President Donald Trump. According to the company, Trump “used his power to ‘screw Amazon’ out of the JEDI Contract as part of his highly public personal vendetta against Mr. Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post.”</p><p>Following an internal audit, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html">released a report</a> that said it found no evidence that the Trump Administration had interfered with the procurement process. At the same time, it noted that several White House officials did not cooperate with the probe. As such, it could not definitively determine whether the administration had affected the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the Defense Department announced it wasn’t moving forward with JEDI, Microsoft published a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/06/microsofts-commitment-to-the-dod-remains-steadfast/">blog post</a> on the decision. “We understand the DOD’s rationale, and we support them and every military member who needs the mission-critical 21st century technology JEDI would have provided. The DOD faced a difficult choice: continue with what could be a years-long litigation battle or find another path forward,” the company said. “The security of the United States is more important than any single contract, and we know that Microsoft will do well when the nation does well.”</p><p>Microsoft went on to say the episode highlights the need for lawmakers to look at the challenge process. &quot;The 20 months since DOD selected Microsoft as its JEDI partner highlights issues that warrant the attention of policymakers: when one company can delay, for years, critical technology upgrades for those who defend our nation, the protest process needs reform,&quot; it said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We understand and agree with the DOD’s decision. Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement,&quot; a spokesperson for Amazon said. &quot;Our commitment to supporting our nation’s military and ensuring that our warfighters and defense partners have access to the best technology at the best price is stronger than ever. We look forward to continuing to support the DOD’s modernization efforts and building solutions that help accomplish their critical missions.”</p><p>Alongside the cancelation, the Pentagon announced a new multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). The agency plans to collect proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft. It contends they&#39;re the two vendors best suited to meet its needs, though it also plans to see if other companies can help it modernize its IT infrastructure. The Defense Department <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and other outlets during a call that it expects to award the first direct JWCC contracts in 2022, with the procurement process to open more broadly as soon as 2025. It also said the litigation with Amazon wasn&#39;t the primary reason for the cancelation of JEDI. “The mission needs have been our primary driver on this,” John Sherman, the DOD acting chief information officer, said.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 3:29PM ET:</strong> Added comment from Amazon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17859900-103e-4897-9ce3-6883ce0518f5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625659642</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:07:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeremy Christensen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's neck speakers are back and now they're for remote workers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just when you think Sony doesn’t have any more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-05-20-sony-rolly-finally-brings-the-party-stateside.html">weird and fanciful designs</a> left in it, the company surprises you.

It&#39;s a neckband speaker the company says it designed with remote workers in mind. Set to cost $150 when it goes on sale later this year, the NB10 promises up to 20 hours of audio playback “optimized for your ears alone” with drivers that are angled upward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cc2b1440-de74-11eb-a27c-dda354014ee3" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Sony SRS-NB10" data-uuid="a190e2e5-09a4-3c88-aad3-d8189d7b72b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>As long as you’re listening to something at a relatively low volume, Sony says you “don’t need to worry about distracting colleagues, roommates or family.” But let’s be real here, you’re wearing a speaker on your shoulders. That’s the kind of energy that’s matched only by the co-worker who insists on bringing their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-60-percent-keyboards-160038272.html">mechanical keyboard</a> to work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SRS-NB10 isn&#39;t only a speaker, however. You can also use it for voice and video calls. Thanks to two beamforming microphones and its built-in voice processing technology, Sony claims the NB10 will make it easy for people on the other end of a call to hear you. What’s more, the “open-ear” design makes it so that you can hear what’s going on around you.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26af88b0-de75-11eb-bfef-ddcbf805d216" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="SRS-NB10" data-uuid="f3b5c5c4-d888-325b-9bfa-fcb7dab9d1fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The NB10 can connect to two Bluetooth-capable devices simultaneously, allowing you to switch between them as needed. Should you have the courage to wear the NB10 to say the gym, they’re also IPX4-certified water-resistant.

The developer maintains that it screens uploaded music and cracks down on violators, but that clearly hasn&#39;t been enough for labels convinced Roblox is enabling piracy. Deals could help Roblox persuade Sony, BMG and others to call off their lawsuit, or at least soften the blow.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roblox-sony-in-game-music-153541190.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f756238-4814-4c5a-a512-d8e3c3b4fb52</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 15:35:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625606072</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T21:14:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/770b6cb0-9fb0-11eb-9ffe-d200f80d1866" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/770b6cb0-9fb0-11eb-9ffe-d200f80d1866" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/03/30: In this photo illustration Roblox logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

It stated that Muse Group will collect users&#39; personal data and possibly share that information with third parties, including law enforcement and potential buyers. That led to claims from users that the software was becoming &quot;spyware.&quot;</p><p>The company has <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>attempted</ins></a> to clear up the controversy, which it says is primarily down to &quot;unclear phrasing in the Privacy Policy,” as <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/audacity-spyware-claims"><em><ins>Music Radar</ins></em></a> reported. Muse Group says it will only collect &quot;very limited&quot; data (operating system version, processor type, IP address and opt-in error reports) from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Audacity"><ins>Audacity</ins></a> users. Users&#39; IP addresses are stored in a readable format for 24 hours before they become &quot;pseudonymized and irretrievable.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Muse Group added it will only share data if required by a court in a jurisdiction in which it operates. It won&#39;t hand over user information following a law enforcement request or otherwise sell or share data. The data collection is &quot;a standard policy requirement for providing services in many jurisdictions, regardless of the depth of data collected or nature of service,&quot; the company said.</p><p>&quot;We do understand that unclear phrasing of the Privacy Policy and lack of context regarding introduction has led to major concerns about how we use and store the very limited data we collect,&quot; Muse Group&#39;s head of strategy Daniel Ray <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>wrote on GitHub</ins></a>. The company is working with its legal team on a revised, clearer version of the policy, which it plans to publish soon.</p><p>The limited data collection is necessary because of two new features in the upcoming version of Audacity, according to Ray: a way to automatically check for updates, and the optional error reporting. Ray didn&#39;t address a privacy policy request for users aged under 13 not to use the app. The General Public License under which Audacity is distributed doesn&#39;t allow restrictions on the use of software.&nbsp;</p><p>The updated privacy policy does not apply &quot;to offline use of the application,&quot; so if you block Audacity&#39;s access to the internet, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. The policy will only come into force with the next version of the software, 3.0.3. Current and older versions don&#39;t have any networking features and they won&#39;t collect any data.</p><p>At best, this was a case of miscommunication which caused concern among Audacity users. Nevertheless, many community members are <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1240"><ins>pushing for</ins></a> a fork of the open-source app without any data collection requirements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audacity-data-collection-privacy-policy-muse-group-145857557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">580774a6-0449-4fc2-bafe-0a5256d5ba17</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625583690</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T15:01:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c75411c0-de69-11eb-b7af-9a05c33319d0" width="926" height="557" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c75411c0-de69-11eb-b7af-9a05c33319d0" width="926" height="557" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
