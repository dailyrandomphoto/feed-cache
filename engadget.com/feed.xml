Also, the option is off by default, so you&#39;ll have to find it in settings if you want to take advantage of your phone&#39;s capabilities.</p><p>As the publication notes, <em>Pokémon Go</em> was previously capped at 30fps on iOS — players have had to employ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9rdvq0/solution_how_to_run_game_60_fps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">workarounds</a> to get their games to run at 60fps — but newer phones are capable of more frames per second than that. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-promotion-display-third-party-apps-225100034.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, for instance, has a 120fps screen. <em>The Verge</em> says switching the feature on made a huge difference and made the game a lot more responsive. While Niantic may have been trying to cater to owners of the new iPhone, the option can also be accessed on its predecessors. It just may not work as well on hardware powered by older chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can find the the feature in the game&#39;s advanced settings, which will show &quot;native refresh rate unlocked&quot; when it&#39;s switched on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-ios-higher-refresh-rates-123636483.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">212989ca-7135-413e-98bc-04a047d3276f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:36:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638533783</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T12:16:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[adamkaz via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[La Habra, United States - July 12, 2016: Macro closeup image of pokemon go game app icon among other icons on an iphone smartphone device.

As Mario travels from the tropical jungles of Lavalava Island to the frosty heights of Shiver Mountain, he&#39;ll need all the help he can get. Master the abilities of the seven Star Spirits and the other allies joining the adventure to aid our hero on the battlefield.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Paper Mario</em> for the N64 will be available to Expansion Pack subscribers starting on December 10th.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="d7cdd67a799c41f4af1d41f306c4c289"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZU9sbtU0mc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-paper-mario-switch-online-expansion-pack-101657918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cbe979ef-1eba-44fa-a9d6-6d03822d103a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 10:16:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638524930</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T09:49:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25cf1450-5414-11ec-beff-a373c816ff1e" width="1600" height="1050" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25cf1450-5414-11ec-beff-a373c816ff1e" width="1600" height="1050" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Paper Mario]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Paper Mario]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google delays its workers' return to office yet again]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google workers in the US will no longer be required to return to in-office work on January 10th. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, company security VP Chris Rackow told employees in an email that Google will wait to reassess the situation and figure out when it&#39;s safe to return to an in-office environment until the new year. The tech giant originally planned to implement a hybrid work week starting on October 18th before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-voluntary-return-to-office-plan-204850097.html">pushing it back</a> to January next year. Now, it may all depend on each of its offices.&nbsp;</p><p>Rackow didn&#39;t explain the company&#39;s reasoning in his email, and he didn&#39;t mention the newly discovered Omicron COVID-19 variant, as well. There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and experts are still looking into whether it&#39;s more transmissible than previous variants and if it&#39;s more resistant to current vaccines. What he reportedly said, however, is that Google will allow specific offices to decide when it&#39;s safe to go back into the office. The company will form Local Incident Response Teams to help them assess risk levels, but bottom line is that Google employees may not be required to adhere to a hybrid workplace schedule all at the same time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite canceling its January 10th target date, Google is still encouraging employees to work in the office &quot;where conditions allow, to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in [one] more regularly.&quot; Google has already reopened 90 percent of its offices in the US, and 40 percent of its employees in the country already came in. As for its international locations, the company also delayed workers&#39; return to face-to-face work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-delays-workers-return-to-office-055953394.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8544eeb2-e9f9-46f0-96b3-83bf0705d401</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 05:59:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638511233</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T06:00:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/02e7b590-53f7-11ec-ac5a-5fc332937592" width="7570" height="5047" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/02e7b590-53f7-11ec-ac5a-5fc332937592" width="7570" height="5047" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Page Light Studios via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chicago, IL - September 7. 2019: View of the new Google building in the West Loop, Fulton Market area of downtown Chicago.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google building in the West Loop, Fulton Market area]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scientists describe a tiny, molten metal exoplanet in unprecedented detail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists are getting better at characterizing exoplanets, and that&#39;s leading to some surprising discoveries. As <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/hot-little-planet-dense-iron-zips-around-red-dwarf-star-2021-12-02/">reports</a>, a DLR-led team has <a href="https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2021/04/20211202_an-eight-hour-year.html">determined</a> that the relatively nearby (31 light-years) planet GJ 367b is significantly smaller than Earth at 5,592 miles across, but is more dense than Earth — it&#39;s about as dense as iron, and 86 percent of the planet is made from the metal.

It&#39;s so close to its host red dwarf star that an orbit takes just 7.7 hours, and the radiation is so intense that it could reach up to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger">has sued</a> to block the merger over concerns the $40 billion deal would &quot;stifle&quot; competition for multiple technologies, including datacenters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mercedez-benz-autonomous-vehicle-computer-173014585.html">car computers</a>. ARM is a &quot;critical input&quot; that fosters competition between NVIDIA and rivals, the FTC said, and a merger would give NVIDIA a way to &quot;undermine&quot; those challengers.</p><p>The FTC was also worried NVIDIA would have access to sensitive info from ARM licensees. The merger could reduce the incentive for ARM to develop tech that might run counter to NVIDIA&#39;s business goals, officials added. The administrative trial is due to start August 9th, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn&#39;t appear bothered. NVIDIA characterized the lawsuit as the &quot;next step&quot; in the FTC process, and repeated its arguments in favor of the buyout. The acquisition would &quot;accelerate&quot; ARM&#39;s product plans, foster more competition and still protect the chip architecture designer&#39;s open licensing model, according to NVIDIA. You can read the full statement below.</p><p>Despite the claims, an FTC lawsuit is a huge issue for NVIDIA. The Commission files lawsuits like these when it believes a company is breaking the law — concessions might not be enough. It also comes after the European Commission launched an investigation into the purchase in October. NVIDIA is facing questions from major regulators clearly wary of the acquisition, and those agencies might not accept the answers.</p><p>As it stands, NVIDIA&#39;s competition likely isn&#39;t happy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">Qualcomm reportedly objected</a> to the ARM deal in communications with the FTC (among other bodies) over fears NVIDIA might refuse to license designs. And when heavyweights like Apple, MediaTek and Samsung also depend on ARM, it&#39;s doubtful the rest of the market would be enthusiastic.

The Wear OS device would be an eye-catching device with a round display, but no physical bezel — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a> might seem antiquated by comparison.</p><p>Rohan would be a relatively typical smartwatch on the inside with a heart rate sensor and a battery that would still require daily charging. It would use proprietary watch bands, so you&#39;d have to forget about using conventional straps. A tipster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan">talking</a> to <em>The Verge</em> claimed the watch would &quot;cost more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">a Fitbit</a>&quot; and serve as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch</a> competitor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The software may be the most important feature. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel phones</a>, Rohan would serve as a &quot;showcase&quot; for Google&#39;s platform — in this case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html">Wear OS 3</a>. The smartwatch (not necessarily called &quot;Pixel Watch,&quot; despite the name floating around) would theoretically show customers what Wear OS can do, and give hardware partners a reference point to work from. It might also include a Fitbit tie-in, nicknamed &quot;Nightlight.&quot;</p><p>Google has already declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation. However, the concept might not be new. Google supposedly axed its first attempt at an official watch in 2016 and instead has put its trust in third-party offerings from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-04-lg-g-watch-r-review.html">LG</a> and others. It&#39;s moving forward now that it has not only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-now-owns-fitbit-141747501.html">finished acquiring Fitbit</a>, but has reportedly merged its wearable team with Fitbit&#39;s and otherwise tried to replicate Apple&#39;s focus on health.</p><p>A first-party watch might be necessary. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/smartwatch-shipments-surge-q2-2021-171751707.html">dominate the smartwatch market</a> despite a flurry of low-cost hardware and competition from major brands like Samsung and Garmin. Some of this has been blamed on lackluster Wear OS hardware, not to mention a lack of significant OS updates. An official Google watch won&#39;t necessarily up-end the marketplace, but it could spur other watchmakers to try harder and add some (arguably needed) excitement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-smartwatch-release-date-211045180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1154c3aa-063e-45a5-866c-a324b604b7fd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 21:10:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638479447</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T21:11:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SoundCloud's Playback compiles your favorite jams from 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that everyone you know on social media has shared their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify Wrapped</ins></a> year-in-review, SoundCloud would like you to know it too has a chronicle of what you listened to over the last 11 months.

To start, you’ll find a new filter on mobile that allows you to find providers that accept <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-17-medicare-expands-telehealth-during-coronavirus-outbreak.html">Medicare</a>. Additionally, Google has added a directory option that allows clinics to list the languages the staff at their office speak. With today’s launch, there’s support for 12 languages, including Spanish and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fingerspelling-xyz-asl-app-162411505.html">ASL</a>. Lastly, the company now allows healthcare providers to update their Google Business Profile. They can do so by claiming their listing, which should help them ensure important information about their hours and services are accurate.</p><p>All of those may seem like small additions, but they’re ones that should help make healthcare more accessible for more people. If you’re someone who depends on your Medicare, there’s nothing more frustrating than showing up at a doctor’s office or clinic only to find out they don’t accept your plan. Similarly,  a language barrier can often make a significant difference in healthcare outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-search-175919995.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2487f290-f501-4b0f-86fa-dfd2c0d87911</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:59:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638467963</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T17:59:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7efed600-5397-11ec-bfec-f192bb8c06e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7efed600-5397-11ec-bfec-f192bb8c06e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Search tool]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Search tool]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas's first foray into the metaverse will likely include NFTs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nike isn&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nike-roblox-nikeland-metaverse-192234036.html">sportswear brand dabbling</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverses</a>.

The Unicode Consortium <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/">says</a> the top 10 most-used emoji are <a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2019/10/the-most-frequent-emoji.html">mostly unchanged from 2019</a> (the group didn&#39;t release a list last year).</p><p>The Tears of Joy (😂) emoji reigned supreme again. It accounted for five percent of all emoji use, even though many Gen Z-ers find it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/tech/crying-laughing-emoji-gen-z/index.html">deeply uncool</a>. It was also the top emoji in 2019 and the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/spending-2020-together-on-twitter">most tweeted one last year</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Unicode Consortium said the only emoji that gets close to the popularity of Tears of Joy is the Red Heart ❤️. The rest of this year&#39;s top 10 most-used emoji, which mostly have positive vibes, are:</p><ul><li><p>🤣 - Rolling on the Floor Laughing</p></li><li><p>👍 - Thumbs Up Sign</p></li><li><p>😭 - Loudly Crying Face</p></li><li><p>🙏 - Folded Hands (aka the prayer emoji)</p></li><li><p>😘 - Face Blowing a Kiss</p></li><li><p>🥰 - Smiling Face With Three Hearts</p></li><li><p>😍 - Smiling Face with Heart-Shaped Eyes</p></li><li><p>😊 - Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes</p></li></ul><p>It seems most of us aren&#39;t super creative in our emoji use. The top 100 account for around 82 percent of total emoji shares, even though there are more than 3,600 to choose from, not to mention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html">the mashups on Gboard</a>.</p><p>Smiling faces and hand-based emoji are generally very popular, as are the plant-flower and emotion (i.e. hearts) categories. The least popular emoji category is flags. Country flags are used the least, even though there are more emoji in that category than any other and the Summer Olympic Games, one of the biggest demonstrations of national pride, took place this year.</p><p>Given that we&#39;ve been enduring a pandemic for almost two years, it&#39;s not too surprising that there&#39;s been a rise in the use of health-related emoji. Even so, only 🥵 (Hot Face) and 🥴 (Woozy Face) made it into the top 100 this year — 🦠 (Microbe) squeaked into the top 500. After all, instead of using a specific emoji depicting sickness, many people are likely to just say they&#39;re feeling like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-signal-founder-poop-emoji-151740121.html">💩</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s heartening to know that despite the turmoil the humanity has endured lately, our emoji use trends toward happiness, love and positivity. It&#39;s far better to be a 😎 than a 🤡.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/emoji-most-used-2021-tears-of-joy-heart-positivity-170152525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">194f6dde-909c-4e27-bbfc-abb29bd76acc</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:01:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638504000</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T04:00:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1696e00-5390-11ec-b8f7-3606440b9839" width="4306" height="2932" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1696e00-5390-11ec-b8f7-3606440b9839" width="4306" height="2932" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peter Kovalev via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - MAY 26, 2019: People carry a giant Emoji balloon during a parade in Nevsky Avenue as part of the festivities marking the 316th birthday of the city of St Petersburg.

The company has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwAPr5G6WA">provided</a> multiple details making clear the rocket is built for reusability from the ground up. It&#39;ll center on Archimedes, a 1-meganewton liquid oxygen/methane engine built to be used many times over. And with a lighter carbon composite body, the companydoesn&#39;t need many — seven Archimedes engines power the first stage, while the second stage just needs one.</p><p>Neutron could also put an end to tossing away (or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-07-watch-spacex-catch-falcon-9-fairing.html">trying to recover</a>) the fairings that protect the payload. The rocket will have a &quot;Hungry Hippo&quot; fairing that&#39;s part of the first stage design — they simply open when releasing the second stage, and close again when it&#39;s time to land. That should save money, as you might guess, but it also promises faster turnaround times and lighter second stages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tapered shape of the rocket itself is built for reusability with a wider, more stable base. Neutron won&#39;t need a launch tower or girder to take off, Rocket Lab said. The company previously said the machine could carry up to eight metric tons to low Earth orbit versus the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-labs-electron-makes-successful-return-to-flight-after-failed-launch-070809406.html">Electron&#39;s</a> modest 0.3 tons (660lbs).</p><p>Any practical uses are still distant. Rocket Lab said it was still in the midst of a &quot;competitive process&quot; to pick a production facility, launch site and engine test facility on the US East coast. The firm previously said it hoped for a first flight in 2024. Even so, the new details are important — they hint at a future where Rocket Lab carries more (and more varied) payloads at lower costs, making space that much more accessible.</p><div id="4e866d7ba5ad4e8f9a408d9e79e888b6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kwAPr5G6WA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rocket-lab-neutron-details-150747277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1c9b17f5-cf25-41fb-a379-4966efe59903</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:07:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638458141</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T15:15:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c65f1b80-537a-11ec-afff-fa112d208c49" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c65f1b80-537a-11ec-afff-fa112d208c49" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rocket Lab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rocket Lab Neutron vehicle opening its fairings]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rocket Lab Neutron vehicle opening its fairings]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MagSafe battery pack is 24 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that want easy wireless charging on the go, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple&#39;s MagSafe battery pack" href="https://amzn.to/3xKTxhQ">Apple&#39;s MagSafe battery pack</a> is a good option if you have one of the latest iPhones. But of course, like most other Apple accessories, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-175601349.html">palm-sized battery</a> is expensive, coming in at $99. But Amazon has the pack for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen it right now — only $75, or 24 percent off its normal price. Now&#39;s a good opportunity to grab it if you&#39;ve been eyeing it for a while for your own iPhone, or you need a stocking stuffer for an iPhone user in your life.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xKTxhQ" id="4e74ed1faee84cf99e1bb59d07c9ff10" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagSafe battery pack at Amazon - $75</a><p>Like all MagSafe accessories, this battery pack is designed to snap onto the back of your iPhone and it&#39;ll automatically start charging the handset once attached. It fits neatly onto the backside of even the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13 mini</a>, so you can still easily use your phone with one hand while powering up. If you plug in the battery pack while charging your iPhone, you&#39;ll get up to 15W of power and you could get even faster charging when you pair your Lightning cable with an adapter higher than 20W. Plus, you&#39;ll be able to keep track of your phone&#39;s and the battery pack&#39;s recharge on your iPhone&#39;s lock screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s pretty tempting (and often convenient) to go for Apple&#39;s own accessories, but you can often find similar, more affordable options elsewhere. While the number of MagSafe-compatible gadgets is growing, there are still only a few battery packs made by reputable brands. Anker makes two 5,000mAh magnetic power packs, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:standard one" href="https://amzn.to/3luk3qN">standard one</a> and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:newer MagGo model" href="https://amzn.to/3ofoHuA">newer MagGo model</a> that has a built-in, foldable kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while charging. Belkin also makes a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:10,000mAh battery" href="https://amzn.to/3ogFQ7b">10,000mAh battery</a> that works as a magnetic charger and a portable power bank. We haven&#39;t tested any of these alternatives yet, but both Anker and Belkin have a good track record when it comes to mobile accessories — plus, all three battery packs come in between $50 and $60 each, making them even better options for those with tight budgets.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-is-24-percent-off-at-amazon-141038263.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">777585d1-601b-4cf5-93c1-2858d0bd9004</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:10:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638453006</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T13:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will force users at risk of being hacked to enable two-factor authentication]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has taken steps to ensure that users most at risk of being hacked don&#39;t lose their accounts to bad actors. The social network has updated its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-security-monitoring-two-factor-keys-152613046.html">Protect program</a> that was designed to provide extra security features to human rights activists, politicians, journalists and other at-risk users. In a press call with reporters, Facebook announced that it&#39;ll start requiring users part of the program to switch on two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>The website will start implementing the new rule over the coming months all over the world — for members in the US, the requirement will take effect sometime in mid-to-late February. Facebook explained that it worked on making the enrollment and use of two-factor on its website &quot;as frictionless as possible for these groups of people by providing better user experience and support.&quot; It admitted that it may take time for all users to be able to comply with the new rule, since not everyone actively uses its platform. But Facebook and its parent company seem to be pleased with what they&#39;d seen in early testing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta&#39;s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;So far, it&#39;s actually going very, very well we&#39;re seeing well above 90% of people successfully enabling ahead of that mandatory period.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Facebook first tested Protect back in 2018 and offered it to American politicians ahead of the 2020 US Elections. It expanded the program&#39;s scope and opened it up to more users after that— in my case, I was locked out of my account until I activated it. The website is now on track to make the program available in more than 50 countries by the end of year, including the US and India, where <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/">most</a> of its users are based.</p><p>Gleicher said over 1.5 million users had enrolled in the program so far, and 950,000 of them switched on 2FA thanks to Protect. He also said that 2FA is an underutilized feature on the platform, with only 4 percent of the website&#39;s monthly users enabling it. Even so, there are no plans to require people outside of the Protect program to switch it on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1bee97b-3b00-4dc0-b281-396b5d8d0db8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638500067</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T02:54:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charnchai via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Businessman use cell phone and working on office desk and analyzing new project of accounting finance.

The company has partnered with artists, session players and others who created &quot;inspiring playable instrument loops, vocal hooks, one-shots, and soundscapes,&quot; along with a story behind the sounds. You can then use those samples in any way you like to create your own tracks.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://landr-1.wistia.com/medias/wodors0shs?wvideo=wodors0shs">Chromatic</a> is as much about the interface as the capability, according to LANDR. It gives users access to content across genres of music through color-coded mood boards, so you can &quot;quickly audition or earmark individual sound sets&quot; and incorporate them into your workflow. At the same time, they&#39;re matched to the tempo and key of any project.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;As an instrument, Chromatic lets you explore, play, and manipulate original sounds created by artists and producers, making them your own,&quot; says LANDR CEO Pascal Pilon in a statement. &quot;We&#39;ve developed Chromatic to bring the human element back into your virtual studio, a unique way to collaborate and engage with the creators of your favorite tracks and musical styles.&quot;</p><p>Artists who contribute the loops will receive royalties for when they&#39;re used. However, for certain specific artists and labels, LANDR will support splits on works created with their sound sets. &quot;With this unique arrangement, Chromatic will serve as a foundation for emerging producers to collaborate with featured artists, resulting in a split release and promotion of a new work made with their Chromatic content.&quot; This presumably means that Chromatic users would share royalties on commercial releases with select, high-profile loop creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is LANDR&#39;s first instrument, and a move towards a trend of subscriptions toward virtual instruments. A recent example is Output, which recently unveiled a similar subscription-based product called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcade-20-note-kits-instruments-sampler-hands-on-161548233.html">Arcade</a>. <a href="https://www.antarestech.com/product/auto-tune-unlimited/">Auto-Tune</a> also offers a subscription, and Splice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splice-new-creator-plans-with-exclusive-plugins-and-educational-videos-123418413.html">recently launched</a> two vocal VST plugins that are behind subscription walls, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is <a href="https://www.landr.com/en/chromatic?utm_campaign=awareness_chromatic_en_us_pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=organic_referral&amp;utm_source=pr&amp;utm_content=rps&amp;utm_term=professionals">now available</a> as a free download with access to the full library of royalty-free sound sets at $10 per month. It&#39;s also offering an &quot;<a href="https://www.landr.com/en/pricing/">All Access Pass</a>&quot; at $10 per month for six months and $15 per month thereafter, with royalty-free access to the sample library, AI-assisted mastering, music distribution on sites like Spotify, Sessions collaboration and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 12:16PM ET: </strong>This post originally described Chromatic as a DAW, but we have updated the post to clarify it&#39;s a virtual instrument.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/landrs-chromatic-lets-you-create-using-artist-generated-loops-140038379.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ce76d47-50b9-4865-8c66-87034a0042d5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638465603</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T17:20:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LANDR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla is selling a $1,900 Cyberquad ATV for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-made-a-cyberwhistle-and-its-already-sold-out-101040559.html">Tesla</a> has <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids">started selling the Cyberquad</a>, but it&#39;s not the ATV it previewed when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-22-cyberquad-electric-atv-cybertruck-tesla.html">unveiled</a> its electric truck in 2019. No, the Cyberquad you can now buy from the automaker&#39;s store is a much smaller version of the vehicle meant kids — and yes, it actually works.&nbsp;</p><p>The four-wheel ATV is powered by a lithium-ion battery and will run on electricity like its bigger version. It has 15 miles of range with a configurable top speed of 10mph, a full steel frame, a cushioned seat, adjustable suspension and LED light bars. In other words, it looks like a shrunken down version of a legit ATV.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A small Cyberquad will set you back $1,900 and is expected to start shipping within the next two to four weeks. But before you seriously start considering getting it as a gift for your kid this Christmas, know that Tesla says that orders aren&#39;t guaranteed to arrive before the holidays. Also, it&#39;s only currently available from Tesla&#39;s US shop and can only be shipped to continental United States.</p><p>We first saw a glimpse of the Cyberquad (the actual one for for adults) at the Cybertruck event, where it rode onto the back of the truck to show how its adaptive suspension enables easier loading. Musk then confirmed that it will be available for purchase initially as an option for Cybertruck buyers.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/573a76c0-536e-11ec-98b4-cf20041a54b0" alt="Cyberquad" data-uuid="515cf424-1ce9-346d-954d-08f02bc456ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tesla</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cyberquad-atv-for-kids-123948749.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db4f4756-dd11-471a-8a6f-7dd2973150c7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 12:39:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638457635</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T15:07:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/deb07650-536d-11ec-bfd7-4856946881e1" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/deb07650-536d-11ec-bfd7-4856946881e1" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cyberquad]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cyberquad]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
