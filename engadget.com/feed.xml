The move will allow Zoom to expand into call center technology worth up to $24 billion, diversifying its products once employees start returning to the office after the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom when the deal is closed, likely in the first half of 2022. &quot;We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more... value to our customers,‚Äù Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9">statement</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c177944b73d41fca343446a8ad80528"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting news! üéâ We have signed an agreement to acquire <a href="https://twitter.com/Five9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Five9</a>.

Zoom notes that it was already a &quot;long-term&quot; customer of Five9 and said the partnership will give Five9&#39;s business clients access to Zoom products like the multi-platform <a href="https://zoom.us/zoom-phone-features">Zoom Phone</a> app.</p><p>The acquisition won&#39;t have much of an impact on consumers, as Five9 is largely a business-to-business company. However, Zoom&#39;s recent growth has been fueled in part by employees needing to work and communicate from home due to the pandemic. Once that crisis eases, Five9&#39;s contact center business will provide another revenue stream.</p><p>While most of its products are aimed at businesses, Zoom has also embraced the consumer side of things. Last year, the company released a new category of products called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-for-home-130020632.html">Zoom for Home</a>, with both software and a line of hardware devices. While those products are aimed at employees working from home, they can also be used by consumers looking for a reliable video calling system.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-acquires-contact-center-company-five9-for-14-7-billion-101956102.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">501cdc0f-b55a-4d1f-a2f5-3d59f704791c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 10:19:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626689998</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T10:20:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tencent to buy British video game studio Sumo for $1.27 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a busy year for gaming mergers, another deal has just been announced. Tencent is to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-sumo-group-plc/15063228">fully acquire</a> Sumo Group, the UK developer behind <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and <em>Crackdown 3</em>. The Chinese web giant is offering 513 pence per share for the studio, in which it already owns an 8.75 percent stake, valuing it at $1.26 billion (¬£990 million).</p><p>The acquisition brings another major developer into the Tencent fold. Already the world&#39;s biggest gaming company, Tencent owns <em>League of Legends </em>studio Riot Games, and has a financial stake in several publishers including Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Bluehole, Paradox Interactive, Supercell, Grinding Gear Games and Yager, along with chat platform Discord. In February, the company acquired a minority position in <em>DayZ</em> developer Bohemia Interactive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But, Tencent&#39;s dominance has triggered regulatory pushback at home and abroad. Earlier this month, Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-live-streaming-firm-douyu-terminates-merger-deal-with-huya-2021-07-12/">blocked</a> its plan to merge its two game livestreaming sites, Douyu and Huya. Tencent is also negiotiating an agreement with a US national security panel that would allow it to retain its stakes in US companies<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Riot Games and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/chinas-tencent-is-reportedly-in-talks-with-us-to-keep-gaming-investments.html">according</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-tencent-talks-with-us-keep-gaming-investments-sources-2021-05-05/">multiple</a> reports.</p><p>The Sumo acquisition hands Tencent a mix of AAA and indie content. Alongside <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and spinoff <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-online-multiplayer-save-transfer-ps4-ps5-182149137.html"><em>Sackboy</em></a><em>, </em>both published by Sony,<em>&nbsp;</em>Sumo was also behind <em>Hitman 2. </em>It also owns UK-based indie developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/thechineseroom">The Chinese Room</a> (<em>Everybody&#39;s Gone to the Rapture</em>) and Red Kite Games, best known for ports of games like <em>Two Point Hospital</em>. In February, the studio purchased Poland&#39;s PixelAnt Games for ¬£250,000.</p><p>‚ÄúThe business will benefit from Tencent‚Äôs broad videogaming ecosystem, proven industry expertise and its strategic resources, which will help secure and further the aspirations and long-term success of Sumo,‚Äù Ian Livingstone, non-executive chairman of Sumo, said in a statement.</p><p>Between Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html">acquisition of ZeniMax</a> and EA&#39;s deal for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-completes-codemasters-acquisition-141803521.html">Codemasters</a>, 2021 is already turning out to be a blockbuster year for video game consolidation.

If <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s report was accurate, Nintendo would be making $40 more per Switch, a pretty notable boost. The OLED Switch replaces the LED display on the original Switch with a 7-inch 720p OLED screen and doubles the storage to 64GB, while adding an ethernet port and improved kickstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-nintendo-could-launch-two-new-switch-consoles-this-year.html">reports</a> also pointed to the possibility of Nintendo launching another console, the Switch Pro, with higher-end components and NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. However, Nintendo also shot down that rumor. &quot;We also want to clarify that we just announced that Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) will launch in October, 2021, and have no plans for launching any other model at this time,&quot; Nintendo added in a follow-up tweet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-denies-it-will-squeeze-more-profit-from-oled-switch-sales-074528512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f686c0e-a56a-459e-8c08-feb69b365d45</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:45:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626680730</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T07:45:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grimes, Will.i.am and Alanis Morrissette will judge an avatar singing TV show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you more comfortable singing behind a virtual persona than you are on a real stage?

including former managers Cecile Cornet (head of human resources), Tommy Francois (editorial VP) and Serge Hasco√´t (global creative director).

UC Riverside researchers have <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/07/16/air-powered-computer-memory-helps-soft-robot-control-movements">developed</a> pneumatic computer memory that they used to help a soft robot play the piano.</p><p>Instead of conventional transistors and electric circuits, the &quot;air-powered&quot; memory relies on microfluidic valves that control airflow. Atmospheric pressure in a given valve represents a binary &quot;0,&quot; while a vacuum indicates a &quot;1.&quot; The researchers&#39; memory has a complex-enough array of these valves to function like an 8-bit RAM chip ‚Äî not exactly powerful, but good enough that a pair of soft robot hands can play &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; at a slow but steady pace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The absence of positive pressure makes this particularly safe ‚Äî there&#39;s no danger of the memory exploding  in mid-use.</p><p>The technology is far from ready for everyday use. Besides needed improvements to complexity and speed, a robot would need soft versions of processors and other components to completely eliminate the need for rigid electronics. The goal is clear, however. Pneumatic memory could at least reduce the need for chips in soft robots, and points to a future of completely flexible robotics that shouldn&#39;t hurt you if there&#39;s a collision.</p><div id="fca6e9ee57884d9c8aad3310d89da23e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnG7ApR5GS0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soft-robot-pneumatic-memory-200149552.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55844c3b-174e-4be8-99fb-bf3764c75fad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 20:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626638512</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T20:02:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UC Riverside]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NSO spyware was allegedly used to target activists and journalists]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Critics have previously claimed that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">NSO Group spyware</a> was misued to target the media and other innocent people, but new findings might have revealed the extent of that misuse. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">shared</a> a multi-partner investigation claiming that NSO&#39;s Pegasus software was used to successfully hack 37 phones, including journalists, activists and the two women closest to murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p><p>The victims were on a 2016-era list of 50,000 phone numbers from countries believed to conduct both extensive surveillance and use of NSO tools, such as Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The list included 1,000 people who didn&#39;t obviously fit the software&#39;s intended criminal targets, including over 600 politicians, 189 journalists, 85 humans rights activists and 65 business executives.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roughly a dozen Americans working overseas were on the list, but the investigation partners couldn&#39;t conduct forensic studies on most of their phones or find evidence of successful hacks. NSO previously said Pegasus couldn&#39;t be used to snoop on American devices.</p><p>NSO flatly denied the claims stemming from the investigation. It maintained that the information had &quot;no factual basis,&quot; and rejected the notion that Pegasus was used to target Khashoggi or his associates. It maintained that it shut down access &quot;multiple times&quot; over past abuses, and that the list was too large to be focused solely on numbers its client countries would have targeted. The company went so far as to hire a libel attorney, Thomas Clare, that accused the investigation partners of having &quot;misinterpreted and mischaracterized&quot; data while making &quot;speculative and baseless assumptions.&quot;</p><p>NSO has historically pinned abuse claims on the countries themselves, and has said it reviewed the human rights records of a given nation before doing business.</p><p>The report comes a year and a half after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html">Facebook sued NSO</a> for allegedly enabling call exploit attacks against WhatsApp, and mere months after Citizen Lab claimed that NSO software was used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">hack <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists&#39; iPhone</a>s using an iMessage flaw.

As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/18/gurman-iphone-13-apple-watch-always-on/">notes</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman used his weekly &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> to say the 2021 iPhone will potentially have an &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Apple Watch</a>-like&quot; always-on display with better battery life in addition to a 120Hz refresh rate, a smaller screen notch, an A15 chip and video recording upgrades.</p><p>Gurman didn&#39;t outline the always-on screen functionality. However, a past leak from Max Weinbach suggested Apple would use an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panel that, like on the Apple Watch and a few Android phones, could drop to extremely low refresh rates to offer persistent information without a large hit to battery life. You might see some notifications, battery life and the clock without having to wake up your phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The writer also used his newsletter to narrow the time frame for a long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">MacBook Pro redesign</a>. He now expects Apple to start mass production of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">mini LED</a>-equipped laptops in the third quarter of 2021 (aka this summer) with a launch between September and November. That&#39;s still somewhat vague, but it does suggest you won&#39;t have to wait until next year (or watch for a surprise early announcement).</p><p>The new MacBook Pros are rumored to have a &#39;flat&#39; design like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the new iMac</a> (minus the colors) while using a more powerful take on Apple&#39;s M1 chip that could support up to 64GB of RAM and more ports.

The social media firm <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/">posted</a> a refutation of the allegations, using data to suggest that something other than Facebook was responsible for a slowdown in vaccination rates and a rise in cases.</p><p>The company noted that vaccine acceptance in user polling had risen from 70 percent in January 2021 to as high as 85 percent in July, and that cultural group disparities had declined &quot;considerably&quot; over the same period. This was ahead of Biden&#39;s goal of getting 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July ‚Äî to Facebook, this was a sign the company was &quot;not the reason&quot; the US fell short of that target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook added that Canada and the UK had higher vaccination percentages despite using the social network about as much as their American counterparts. There&#39;s &quot;more than Facebook&quot; to the US results, the company said. It also pointed to its efforts to both promote <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-covid-19-forecasts-160038962.html">accurate claims</a> and fight falsehoods, including the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-notifications-harmful-coronavirus-misinformation-191233820.html">misinformation labels</a>, reduced exposure and takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet giant didn&#39;t attempt to find an alternate explanation for US troubles. Some observers have <a href="https://twitter.com/NGrossman81/status/1416724328591282176">pointed</a> to a possible link between political affiliation and vaccination rates, but Facebook didn&#39;t even hint at this in its refutal.</p><p>It&#39;s not a flawless argument. Facebook is trying to draw a link between its polling data and the entire US, which doesn&#39;t make for a neat and tidy comparison. The company also hasn&#39;t shared estimates of how much COVID-19 misinformation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">slips through the cracks</a>. The social site has a strong incentive to downplay its possible contribution to the problem given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html">past complaints</a> that it hasn&#39;t done enough to stop misinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the data shifts the attention back to the Biden administration ‚Äî it may need to provide more substantial data if it&#39;s going to show that health misinformation on social networks like Facebook is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">major threat</a>, as the US Surgeon General recently said.

Published by Park Row Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Coffee and tea are much more potent sources of caffeine than soda. In one cup of coffee, you are likely to ingest around 100 mg of caffeine, but it can be up to 175 mg with the right coffee beans and technique. The whole process of making coffee beans (and coffee itself) is pretty fascinating if you‚Äôve never given it much thought. For example, espresso makers and percolators get the most caffeine out of lighter roasted beans, but the drip method is the best way to get the most trimethylxanthine from darker beans. However, in general, light and dark roast coffees typically have the same relative number of caffeine molecules in each cup of coffee (excluding espressos).</p><p>Let‚Äôs look at the roasting processes to determine why that is. When the beans are initially heated, they absorb energy in what we call an endothermic process. However, at around 175¬∞C (347¬∞F), the process suddenly becomes exothermic. This means that the beans have absorbed so much heat that they now radiate the heat back into the atmosphere of the roasting machine. When this happens, the settings have to be adjusted on the equipment, in order to avoid over-roasting the beans (which sometimes results in burnt-tasting coffee). Some roasters will even toggle the beans between the endothermic and exothermic reaction a couple of times, to achieve different flavors.</p><p>Over time, roasting coffee beans slowly change from green to yellow, and then to a number of different shades of brown. We refer to the darkness of the bean as its ‚Äúroast,‚Äù where the darker roasted coffee beans are much darker in color than the lighter roasted beans (surprise, surprise). Their color comes from the temperature at which they are roasted. Lighter beans are heated to about 200¬∞C (392¬∞F) and darker roasted beans to about 225‚Äì245¬∞C (437‚Äì473¬∞F).</p><p>But just before the beans start to, for lack of better words, lightly roast, the coffee beans go through their first ‚Äúcrack.‚Äù This is an audible process that occurs at 196¬∞C (385¬∞F). During this process, the beans absorb heat and double in size. But since the water molecules evaporate out of the bean when under high temperatures, they actually decrease in mass by about 15%.</p><p>After the first crack, the coffee beans are so dry that they stop readily absorbing heat. Instead, all of the thermal energy is now used to caramelize the sugars on the outside of the coffee bean. This means that the heat is used to break the bonds in the sucrose (sugar) into much smaller (and more fragrant) molecules. The lightest roasts‚Äîlike cinnamon roast and New England roast‚Äîare heated just past the first crack before being removed from the coffee roaster.</p><p>There is a second crack that occurs during the roast, but at a much higher temperature. At 224¬∞C (435¬∞F), the coffee beans lose their structural integrity, and the bean itself starts to collapse. When this happens, you can usually hear it by a second ‚Äúpop.‚Äù Dark roasts are typically categorized by any beans that have been heated past the second crack‚Äîlike French and Italian roasts. In general, due to the hotter temperatures, darker beans tend to have more of their sugars caramelized, while lighter beans have less. The variation in flavor due to these methods is wild, but it doesn‚Äôt really affect how they react in the body‚Äî only the taste.</p><p>Once you purchase your perfectly roasted coffee beans, you can do the rest of the chemistry at home. With an inexpensive coffee grinder, you can grind up your coffee beans to a number of different sizes, which will definitely affect the taste of your morning coffee. Small, fine grinds have a lot of surface area, which means the caffeine (and other flavors) can be extracted from the miniaturized coffee beans with ease. However, this can often result in too much caffeine being extracted, which gives the coffee a bitter taste.</p><p>On the other hand, coffee beans can be coarsely ground. In this instance, the insides of the coffee beans are not exposed to nearly the same degree as finely ground coffee beans. The resulting coffee can often taste sour‚Äîand sometimes even a little salty. But if you partner up the correct size of coffee grounds with the appropriate brewing method, you can make yourself the world‚Äôs best cup of coffee.</p><p>The simplest (and easiest way) to brew coffee is to add extremely hot water to coarse coffee grounds. After they have soaked in the water for a few minutes, the liquid can be decanted from the container. This process, called decoction, uses hot water to dissolve the molecules within the coffee beans. Most current methods of coffee brewing utilize some version of decoction, which is what allows us to drink a cup of warm coffee instead of chomping on some roasted beans. However, since this method does not contain a filtration process, this version of coffee‚Äîaffectionately referred to as cowboy coffee‚Äîis prone to having coffee bean floaters. For that reason, it‚Äôs usually not the preferred brewing method.</p><p>By the way, did you notice that I was avoiding the term <em>boiling</em>? If you‚Äôre trying to make halfway decent cup of coffee, the hot water should never actually be boiled. Instead, the ideal temperature of the water is around 96¬∞C (205¬∞F), which is just below boiling (100¬∞C, 212¬∞F). At 96¬∞C, the molecules that provide the aroma of coffee begin to dissolve. Unfortunately, when the water is just four degrees hotter, the molecules that give coffee a bitter taste dissolve as well. That‚Äôs why coffee nerds and baristas are so obsessed with their water temperature. In my house, we even use an electric kettle that allows us to select whatever temperature we want our water to be.</p><p>Depending on how strong you like your coffee to taste, you may be partial to the French press or another steeping method. Like cowboy coffee, this technique also soaks the coffee grounds in hot water, but these grounds are a little smaller (coarse versus extra coarse). After a few minutes, a plunger is used to push all of the grounds to the bottom of the device. The remaining liquid above the grounds is now perfectly clear and deliciously tasty. Since the coarse coffee grounds are used in this method, more molecules can dissolve in the coffee solution, providing us with a more intense flavor (compared to cowboy coffee).</p><p>Another technique: when hot water is dripped over coffee grounds, the water absorbs the aromatic molecules before dripping into the coffee mug. This process, appropriately called the drip method, can be done manually or with a high-tech machine, like a coffee percolator. But sometimes this technique is used with cold water, which means that the fragrant, aromatic molecules (the ones that give your coffee its distinctive smell) cannot dissolve in the water. The result is called Dutch iced coffee, a drink that is ironically favored in Japan, and takes about two hours to prepare.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-its-elemental-kate-biberdorf-harper-collins-153015871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7577aec-08c0-4596-bd2d-c7bef8b9bceb</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626281241</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T16:56:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nando Martinez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casual young black woman taking a relaxing cup of coffeee in the kitchen at home.

There are those who see it as a nice thing to do with your family once in a while, and there are those who take it‚Ä¶ a little more seriously. The upcoming <em>Behind the Attraction</em>, hitting <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BXx1B0">Disney+</a> on July 21st, is a show that‚Äôs aimed at turning more of those casual tourists into dedicated fans, by explaining the backstory behind famous attractions like Star Tours, the Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.</p><p>Each episode features lots of old footage, talking heads, conceptual art and snark. If you‚Äôre thinking that sounds like <em>The Toys That Made Us</em>, but for Disney Parks, you‚Äôd be absolutely correct. <em>Behind the Attraction</em> is produced and directed by Brian Volk-Weiss, the creative mind behind Netflix docuseries like <em>TTTMU</em> and <em>The Movies That Made Us</em>. He was specifically sought out by Disney+ for his style which, by his own description, is ‚Äúfocused more on fun‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt treat its subject like ‚Äúthe rise and fall of the Roman Empire.‚Äù He loves documentaries, but hates when they take silly topics too seriously.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37f7cb60-e4d7-11eb-b6ef-43e993965012" style="height:2000;width:2964;" alt="Hippos in the river at Jungle Cruise" data-uuid="231dcba6-bc28-35e7-b5d5-a29d7754bbac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>To wit, the series is narrated by comedy veteran Paget Brewster, an actress who has been in <em>The Venture Bros.</em>, <em>Community</em> and <em>Another Period</em>. Disney fans will probably recognize her best as the voice of Della Duck on the 2017 <em>DuckTales</em> reboot. She adopts a light playful tone, as far from Morgan Freeman you can get. Also on board is executive producer Dwayne Johnson, who stars in Disney‚Äôs upcoming live action <em>Jungle Cruise</em> film. Is there an episode about the Jungle Cruise attraction? Of course there is.</p><p>Besides that, the other four episodes available this week focus on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-06-disney-worlds-haunted-mansion-gets-interactive-upgrade-digital.html">Haunted Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20wars">Star Tours</a>, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Space Mountain. (Episodes about things like the castles and transportation systems, as well as famous rides like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Small World‚Äù and Pirates of the Caribbean are being held for later in the year.) They trace the history and development of each individual attraction with clips from shows like 1955‚Äôs <em>Disneyland</em> and <em>The Wonderful World of Disney</em>, news segments, and a mix of new and old interviews. Anyone who watched the docuseries <em>The Imagineering Story</em> (also on Disney+) will recognize a lot of reused footage from there. Which of course begs the question, why did we need another behind-the-scenes show?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/97bed660-e4d7-11eb-bdbe-b70faa2ae09d" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="Star Tours / Galaxy&#39;s Edge" data-uuid="22114616-25c4-32aa-8b83-2ecb37dd4de7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>The biggest difference between the two is that <em>The Imagineering Story</em> takes a strict chronological approach, starting with the origin story behind Walt Disney‚Äôs desire to build a theme park, progressing through the opening of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disneyland">Disneyland</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/walt%20disney%20world">Walt Disney World</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epcot">Epcot</a> and so on. The later episodes focus less on a historical outlook and more on ‚Äúlook at what cool technology we built for this new thing.‚Äù Which leads to a sort of unbalanced feel to the program, as well as a greater sense that it‚Äôs one big travel brochure for the Disney Parks.</p><p>Which isn‚Äôt to say that <em>Behind the Attraction</em> isn‚Äôt one big advertisement. I certainly want to visit Disney Shanghai after getting a look at the development of its Storybook Castle and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tron">TRON</a> Lightcycle Power Run. But because the new show takes a more topical approach, it‚Äôs a lot more ‚Äúsnackable,‚Äù with episodes that can be watched in any order according to what interests you the most.&nbsp;</p><p>Each episode still follows its individual subject chronologically, like how the Hall of Presidents episode goes into the development of the original ‚ÄúGreat Moments with Mr. Lincoln‚Äù show at the 1964 World‚Äôs Fair to the installation of the attraction at Disneyland, the creation of the full Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World to today‚Äôs animatronics like the ones used on Avengers Campus at California Adventure. <em>The Imagineering Story</em> talks about the development of the ‚ÄúStuntronics‚Äù as well, but it‚Äôs <em>Behind the Attraction</em> that draws a straight line for the viewer from Abraham Lincoln giving a speech to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-animatronic-spider-man-disneyland.html">Spider-Man doing somersaults</a> in the air. You actually understand how tech created in 1964 can still shape something built in 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/23ae4590-e4d6-11eb-bd37-140c5cb5a6e1" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Ghost hitchhikers in the Haunted Mansion" data-uuid="f5484519-bf52-367f-a578-de5f58459a52"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>While it&#39;s unlikely that <em>Behind the Attraction</em> will ever delve into the various faceplants the company has taken over the years the way YouTube shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YesterworldEntertainment/"><em>Yesterworld</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Defunctland/"><em>Defunctland</em></a> do, the new show is at least capable of admitting when certain things didn‚Äôt work. The Haunted Mansion had to be completely rethought for Shanghai, while Japan got a different backstory for its Tower of Terror. And the original Jungle Cruise had no dad jokes!</p><p>Of course, there are no Splash Mountain or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-29-captain-eo-is-back.html">Captain EO</a> episodes, so we don‚Äôt know yet how the show will deal with some of the more unsavory or embarrassing bits of Disney Park history. Which is fine, since <em>Behind the Attraction</em> isn‚Äôt intended to be a complete history of Disney, just a quick half-hour show that will have you going ‚Äúdid you know?‚Äù to all your friends and family the next time you visit the Magic Kingdom.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-behind-the-attraction-review-130039942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ec293c5-1dbf-4fb7-a1b3-afb2536606e7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 13:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626291864</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:44:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel Destinations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35433d40-e4d8-11eb-b93f-282420fee3c7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35433d40-e4d8-11eb-b93f-282420fee3c7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney Parks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cinderella's Castle at dusk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon convinces Apple to remove review analyzer Fakespot from the App Store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fakespot, an app that analyzes Amazon reviews to determine which ones are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-27-ftc-cracks-down-on-fake-amazon-reviews-in-landmark-case.html">fake</a>, is no longer available for iOS.

One of its biggest concerns, Amazon told us, was that the redesigned app Fakespot launched in June &quot;wraps&quot; and injects code into its website.</p><p>&quot;Wrapping&quot; would make it possible, in theory, for the app to collect data and put customers&#39; sensitive information, including credit card numbers, at risk.

Apparently, Apple didn&#39;t give his company adequate warning before the app was taken down and didn&#39;t even give it a chance to rectify any issue the tech giant may have.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple has yet to issue a statement that would clarify why exactly Fakespot was pulled down, Amazon pointed <em>Engadget</em> to two App Store guidelines, in particular. One of those guidelines states that an app that displays content from a third-party service must secure permission from that service. The other prohibits applications from displaying false information.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in early 2020, Amazon went after another add-on used to track prices and discount: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-amazon-paypal-honey-security-risk.html">Honey</a>, a $4 billion PayPal acquisition. People using Honey saw a warning on Amazon&#39;s website that said the extension &quot;tracks [their] private shopping behavior, collects data like [their] order history and items saved, and can read or change any of [their] data on any website [they] visit.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 07/17/21 10:50AM ET: </strong>A spokesperson told us Apple reached out to Fakespot weeks before pulling it from the App Store, contradicting Khalifah&#39;s claim that his company didn&#39;t get adequate warning. The Apple spokesperson said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This was a dispute over intellectual property rights initiated by Amazon on June 8 and within hours we ensured both parties were in contact with one another, explaining the issue and steps for the developer to take to keep their app on the store and giving them ample time to resolve the issue. On June 29, we again reached out to Fakespot weeks before removing their app from the App Store.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fakespot-app-store-033147651.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ae1bffb6-a912-4676-aec6-25553b115e99</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 03:31:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626533900</ingested><modified>2021-07-17T14:58:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f7522110-e6a1-11eb-bfff-edb16fd0a4d3" width="6720" height="3780" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f7522110-e6a1-11eb-bfff-edb16fd0a4d3" width="6720" height="3780" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alexsl via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[London, UK - 03 05 2021: Apple iPhone 8 screen with Online shopping e-commerce mobile app icons applications Amazon, Ebay, AliExpress, Wish etc.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Online shopping e-commerce mobile app icons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM warns not to park Chevy Bolt EVs indoors after two recently caught fire]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Owners of 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs should not park their cars indoors or leave them to charge overnight unattended, according to a safety alert issued by <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consumer-alert-important-chevrolet-bolt-recall-fire-risk"><ins>The National Highway Traffic Administration</ins></a> (NHTSA).
