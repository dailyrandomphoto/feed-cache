Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/10/09/governor-newsom-takes-final-action-of-2021-legislative-session/">signed a law</a> over the weekend that orders regulators to prohibit the sale of small off-road engines.</p><p>The California Air Resources Board was already working on rules to that effect, but Newsom has given the agency deadlines for adopting and applying the regulations. The agency has until July 1st to adopt the rules. The regulations will apply to engines made on or after January 1st, 2024, or whenever is feasible in the state board&#39;s opinion — whichever is later. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1346">The law</a> also stipulates that regulators will need to offer rebates to lower the cost of switching equipment. The latest state budget set aside $30 million to cover the costs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aim of the law is to reduce emissions. As the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/10/11/california-lawn-mower-gas-engine-ban/"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a> notes, California brought in emission standards for those engines in 1990. Although emissions from cars have generally decreased over the last few decades, that hasn&#39;t necessarily been the case for small off-road engines.</p><p>State officials have said that a gas-powered leaf blower that&#39;s used for one hour emits the same level of pollution as a 2017 Toyota Camry that travels for around 1,100 miles. There are currently more than 16.7 million devices with small off-road engines in California — three million or so more than the number of passenger cars in the state.</p><p>California is tackling emissions from gas-powered engines on other fronts. Last year, the California Air Resources Board said all truck and van manufacturers will have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html"><ins>switch to electric versions</ins></a> by 2045. The state will also ban sales of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALj3E9u2WdaP0VlDzcGzeGqejfZ_69dB8CtpbwAjyneEKKJm5vQSp-6QC4X0sa_0AnqkMo0oO2lWkX7KTaS8t4vn8EjSOC0M1H7-IGJGclJc7i6WmmG74kYhA0tdw5S3r3udyAka4VpG0rRvFz_gGnirJfge3wcX1WZhYQdBYx83"><ins>new combustion engine cars and trucks</ins></a> by 2035.

Per <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/chevrolet-begins-replacing-batteries-in-recalled-bolt-evs/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social"><em><ins>Ars Technica</ins></em></a>, GM has started replacing the battery packs of affected vehicles. The automaker is reaching out to Bolt owners with cars manufactured “during specific build timeframes” first. Once you get your EV to a Chevy dealership, the replacement process should take approximately two days. Each new pack comes with an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty.</p><p>Replacing the battery of every Chevy Bolt manufactured between 2017 and 2019 is expected to cost GM more than $1.8 billion. The fault that led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks-154033780.html"><ins>fires</ins></a> that necessitated the recall stemmed from a pair of related issues. A problem with the original manufacturing process could cause the battery anodes in affected cars to tear and cathode-anode separators to fold. If both defects came up in the same battery, it would have a higher chance of catching fire.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;LG has implemented new manufacturing processes and has worked with GM to review and enhance its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward,&quot; GM said last month when it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html">detailed</a> how it would go about replacing batteries. “LG will institute these new processes in other facilities that will provide cells to GM in the future.”&nbsp;</p><p>GM will also start rolling out new diagnostic software in November for all Bolt EVs. The company says the firmware will help it prioritize the cars that need service sooner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-recall-battery-replacement-155343570.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d2363a9-64a1-4e39-bfb2-a563b5363ce1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 15:53:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633967627</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T15:53:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/8548dde0-ac48-11eb-97ff-b8bb90e95df3" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/8548dde0-ac48-11eb-97ff-b8bb90e95df3" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chevy Bolt]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Chevy Bolt]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google TV is adding multi-user support and an improved ambient mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google TV is about to make it easier for everyone in your household to maintain their own watchlists.

Horizon is the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/478bf7e0-2a23-11ec-bc7b-106779bd1028" style="height:1760;width:3128;" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="6f129e11-ab2a-3663-9412-0fa0a93d8721"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games</div></figure><p><em>Horizon 5</em> takes place in a fictionalized Mexico, which makes it the perfect stomping ground for the 2021 Ford Bronco, an SUV that I’ve been drooling over for more than a year in real life. It’s the first new model in 25 years, it’s styled after the first-generation Bronco that Ford rolled out in 1965, and, best of all, it comes in a cactus gray colorway. However, for a multitude of reasons — the global chip shortage, supply-chain slowdowns and the sheer expense of it all — I’m not likely to get my feet on the pedals of a new Bronco any time soon. That’s where <em>Horizon 5</em> comes in.</p><p><em>Horizon 5</em> begins with a yellow Bronco Badlands strapped to the floor of a plane, ramp lowered behind it with clear sky soaring by. Starting the game drops the vehicle out of the plane, parachuting you onto the rim of a snow-capped volcano. Immediately, you’re driving at high speeds, following a trail down the fiery mountain and getting a feel for the Bronco. It moves like a heavy piece of machinery, tilting on quick turns and cannonballing down the road, sturdy yet sensitive. (The obligatory, “I like my partners the way I like my SUVs” goes here.)</p><p>And then the next car drops from the sky — a zippy 2020 Corvette Stingray Coupe that drives much differently than the Bronco, turning on a dime and floating over the road. After a few minutes with that, a 1989 Porsche 911 Desert Flyer parachutes past a herd of flamingos, zooming down forest trails with fantastic handling. Finally, the Mercedes-AMG One, a superfast hybrid sports car, finishes the ride by racing an airplane.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e3066fe0-2a21-11ec-b7ff-3a44978edea9" style="height:1760;width:3128;" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="3aa75bf8-4543-318f-96ba-a3fcd7a95f3f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games</div></figure><p>Each of the starting vehicles has its own sensibilities and strengths. They all finally land at the Horizon Festival, a massive music and racing extravaganza held in the Mexico desert. This is the main hub of the game, and it’s a party atmosphere filled with bright pink signs, crowds of cheering fans and a ceaseless barrage of fireworks, confetti and hot air balloons.</p><p>This is where you’re given the chance to pick a vehicle for the first time, and it’s the origin of my <em>Horizon 5</em> mantra: Bronco. Every. Time.</p><p>It’s not that the Bronco is the fastest or smoothest vehicle in the game, but it feels right rolling through the rugged desert landscape. It’s the vehicle I want to be driving in real life, and it’s incredibly satisfying to maneuver it up winding mountain roads, along charming city streets and into the heart of massive dust storms.</p><p>To be fair, I don’t actually pick the Bronco <em>every</em> time — there are some races that the SUV simply can’t win, given its top speed and wide turns, and for these I’ll happily use one of the sports cars. But when it comes to exploring, I’m all about the Bronco.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6fe9481a698440278068379037cc6518" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe3b28a0-2a21-11ec-bfe6-5a0db367c5ff" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="c3ee118d-2342-3503-be7a-dcf381441c8b"></section><p>That said, all of the vehicles in <em>Horizon 5</em> are magic. They get cracks in the windows and dents in the doors, but they’re truly indestructible and no matter how many backflips they do, they always land tires-down. Plus, if you mess up a turn or run into an immovable object, you’re able to rewind time. In the end, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a cactus-lined fever dream of racing, leaping and crashing, and then resetting and doing it all again.</p><p>The preview includes the first 90 minutes or so of <em>Horizon 5</em>, offering a world map with a handful of races to complete and bonuses to earn by driving around and smashing up the environment. There are multiple layers of customization in the game, from character creation and accessorizing, to vehicle designs and purchases. The preview ends as you unlock your first house of the game, a beautiful pink casita surrounded by cacti and mountains.</p><p>I’m playing <em>Horizon 5</em> on Xbox Series S, the mid-range platform for this title. It’s heading to PC, Xbox Series X and S, and the Xbox One family of consoles, and the main difference among these platforms will be graphical fidelity and loading times. Xbox One players will see loading screens, while PC and Series players won’t, since those platforms can take advantage of SSDs. There’s also no raytracing on the Xbox One versions.</p><div id="279354bf4a5a4349ba2b3cc132e1963f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On Series S, <em>Horizon 5</em> runs smoothly and looks beautiful so far, maxing out at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and 60fps without raytracing. The final version will be capped at 30fps with raytracing, but this feature wasn’t live in the Series S preview build. Playground Games promises the raytracing mode will be in the Series S edition at launch. Even without the boost, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a treat to look at, with four distinct biomes, dynamic weather and seasons, and dense, lived-in environments.</p><p>After more than a year of restricted travel and stay-at-home orders across the globe, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a delightful, easygoing escape. It’s lighthearted yet intensely detailed, with realistic environments and vehicles, and it offers whatever type of challenge you want. There are multiple difficulty settings for each race, but there’s also the option to just ride around, drive up the side of a volcano or cruise along the beach. <em>Horizon 5 </em>is the escape I need right now, and bonus, I get to do it in the Bronco of my dreams.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>is due out on November 9th and it’ll be included in Xbox Game Pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cabb9c83-6162-40db-a939-e4a0b592e9f2</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633909302</ingested><modified>2021-10-10T23:41:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f0624a60-27b5-11ec-9f5f-c16b0b8b31e8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f0624a60-27b5-11ec-9f5f-c16b0b8b31e8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Playground Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 returns to record low of $850 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3oQk4I5">MacBook Air M1</a> combines power and portability into a sleek package, making it one of the best laptops we&#39;ve tried for most people. It normally starts at $999, but Amazon has, once again, knocked the price down to $850. That&#39;s for the 256GB model, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/2YAPcAZ">512GB model</a> is also $150 off, bringing it down to $1,099. We&#39;ve seen this discount come and go pretty quickly over the past couple of months, so now&#39;s a good time to grab the laptop if you&#39;ve wanted to upgrade to a daily driver.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oQk4I5" id="6319570ec7f84592a7e2b1ade7e92673" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YAPcAZ" id="aacd7f571c274a6b8c1514879a099938" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $850</a><p>The Air M1 earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">score of 94</a> from us when it came out about one year ago, thanks in part to its thin-and-light design, lovely Retina display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad and impressive performance. The former comes from Apple&#39;s M1 chipset and you&#39;ll immediately notice the performance gains if you&#39;re coming from an older MacBook. The laptop wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run smoothly and the machine is, on the whole, quite responsive. The GPU performance is better as well — while we still wouldn&#39;t run intense games on the Air M1, it can handle Apple Arcade titles and even <em>Fortnite</em> easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate how quiet the MacBook Air M1 is because it lacks a fan inside. You won&#39;t hear constant whirring when you&#39;re putting the laptop through its paces, and you&#39;ll be able to do so for up to 16 hours since the machine has an excellent battery life. The biggest hassles you&#39;ll deal with on the Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its two USB-C ports, the latter of which means you&#39;ll be living the dongle life for a little while longer. But if you can deal with those minor infractions, you&#39;ll still get a solid laptop that can go with you almost anywhere in the MacBook Air M1.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-returns-to-record-low-of-850-at-amazon-122835931.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7176e477-9be3-4b20-8873-486579266528</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 12:28:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633955319</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T12:28:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds drop to an all-time low of $128]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even after two years, Sony&#39;s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds are among the best you can buy in terms of sound quality and active noise cancellation.

That&#39;s largely thanks to the excellent sound quality with bass that&#39;s powerful yet clear, bright highs and solid performance for all types of music.

Its six hours of battery life is also less than the eight hours offered by the new model.

Pouring on speed, I finally see what all the Mach-E fuss was about.</p><p>Ok so here’s the part of the story where I eat a big plate of crow. When I reviewed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">Mach-E base model back in February</a> I found it to be a perfectly serviceable EV, but more akin to similarly-shaped electric SUVs like the Kia Niro or the Volkswagen ID.4 than the venerated muscle cars I hung posters of in my childhood bedroom. Sure, the pony I drove had plenty of get-up-and-go — EVs are torquey that way — but it never rumbled the depths of my bowels like a naturally aspirated 4-barrel V8 could. The Mach-E GT does. Switch over to the performance-forward Unbridled power management mode — or Unbridled Extend, which optimizes traction and stability control and is great for lapping ICE owners on track day — and the Mach-E GT will haul more ass than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozvIxnIsn4w">a secret lab overflowing with butt monsters</a>. Stomp on the gas in the 480 horsepower, 600 ft-pound torque GT and this thing will loosen your fillings. Do so in the uber-torqued GT Performance edition and you’re liable to swallow a few teeth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/022b0260-285f-11ec-bfe3-0e988cf5e925" alt="Mustang Mach-E GT Performance edition" data-uuid="4d7ae235-ded4-332b-b0bc-317f00d42205"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It won’t be difficult to spot the GT and Performance editions on the street. I mean, if the prominent GT badge on the rear liftgate and illuminated Mustang icon on the front grille don’t give it away, both iterations sit about 10 mm lower than the base model and have added styling on the front facia. You’ll also be able to spot them via their wheels as both the GT and the Performance sport unique 20-inch rims (as opposed to the 18s and 19s offered on the base) rocking 245/45R20 Continental all-season tires and fire engine red Brembo brake calipers. On the interior, however, the GT is practically identical to the base model, save for the seats which offer added cushioning and lateral support as there is a better than not chance you’re going to get sideways within the first week of owning one.</p><p>As for driving performance, I’m a bit torn. Nostalgia, as I’ve explained previously, is a hell of a drug and my fondest automotive memories stem from tearing up San Francisco’s streets in a 65 outfitted with a drag racing suspension and a T-10 3-speed, which has deeply biased my understanding of what to expect from the Mach-E. It is, honestly, difficult to reconcile in my head that the Mustang is now an SUV and, despite its overwhelming power, still largely drives like one. Give me a straight shot like, say, that length of highway 101 running through Silva Island towards Larkspur and the GT can, will, and very much did beat the pants off of any Tesla on the freeway as well as one overly confident, tailgating Supra.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0234ed71-285f-11ec-ae67-aa453236e9f5" alt="Mustang Mach-E GT Performance edition" data-uuid="5db7b707-46e4-3d67-922e-edfe4f5a406b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The tight, twisting turns of Highway 1, especially the un-railed cliffside sections where a mistimed tap of the accelerator would fly you clear off a 100-plus foot drop, were a different matter entirely. You can feel the understeer, despite it being an AWD, as well as the GT’s 4,600 pounds of curb weight through hairpin turns. But again it’s an SUV, that’s to be expected — even from one with a sub-4 0-60. The GT’s MagneRide suspension — which leverages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorheological_fluid">magneto-rheological fluid</a> to stiffen the ride on demand — shined through during those slaloming sections. Even though the wide-bodied GT wallows like a pig in mud through sharp curves, not once did I have to fight the vehicle’s body roll when entering turns.</p><p>The GT starts at $59,900, boasts 480 peak horsepower, 600 lb.-ft. of torque with a 0-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds and an estimated 270 mile range. The GT Performance edition, on the other hand, starts at $64,900, with the same amount of horsepower but a full 634 lb.-ft. of torque and a 3.5 second 0-60 and 260 miles of range. Those figures put the Mach-E GT on par with the Chevy Bolt and VW ID.4 in terms of drivable distance, though the Mustang outclasses them both in terms of driving excitement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/022bc5b0-285f-11ec-becd-54023116d702" alt="Mustang Mach-E GT Performance edition" data-uuid="6257ea70-2d32-38b7-a92e-d870a85264c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Range anxiety wasn’t much of a concern during my test drive thanks to the Mach-E’s connected navigation system which continually monitors the vehicle’s battery levels and points out available charging stations along the drive route. What’s more, Ford is offering two years of complimentary use of its Blue Oval Charge Network. For those drivers who wish to do their charging at home, Ford’s Connected Charging station can add 30 miles per charging hour on a 240V outlet while the included mobile charging cord can impart 20 miles of range per hour using a similar 240V outlet.</p><p>Deliveries for both the GT and the GT Performance edition have <a href="https://www.ford.com/suvs/mach-e/">already begun</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93f2fc8d-9b45-4625-a988-49442c90b158</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 10:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633970305</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T16:38:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/81511970-2860-11ec-befd-4a3616360762" width="4032" height="2268" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/81511970-2860-11ec-befd-4a3616360762" width="4032" height="2268" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mustang Mach-E GT]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mustang Mach-E GT]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max headphones are $100 off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With excellent sound, solid ANC and good battery life, Apple&#39;s AirPods Max headphones have a lot going for them.

The ANC on Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4 model is slightly more effective, but the AirPods Max are close, blocking out most environmental noise. Like other AirPods models, the Transparency Mode lets you quickly disable ANC and join conversations. One of the main drawbacks is a lack of lossless audio support, but they do work with with Dolby Atmos spatial audio on most Apple devices.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the AirPods Max really shine if you&#39;re in the Apple ecosystem. With its H1 chip, it&#39;ll quickly pair with and switch between an iPhone and a Mac, for example — letting you quickly go from taking a call to editing video. The regular price of $549 is a lot to pay for that convenience, however, so Amazon&#39;s $100 discount presents a good opportunity to pick up a pair.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-air-pods-max-headphones-are-100-off-at-amazon-085715960.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ba6469e-4722-4554-b081-5340d082fa80</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:57:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633942638</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T08:57:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/284e1350-2a6d-11ec-a2ff-ae67d8737c70" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/284e1350-2a6d-11ec-a2ff-ae67d8737c70" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max headphones are $100 off at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max headphones are $100 off at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gogoro launches its battery-swapping tech in China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gogoro has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gogoro-launches-battery-swapping-in-china-301396659.html">announced</a> that its hot-swappable battery technology has arrived China and will be compatible with two local scooter brands so far.

Breaks and nudges may reduce exposure to harmful content, but they won&#39;t remove the content in question. Clegg&#39;s statements also reflect a familiar strategy at Facebook. It likes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-11-facebook-says-it-needs-more-regulation-not-a-breakup.html">invite regulation</a>, but only the regulation it&#39;s comfortable with.

Some have suspected it was a simple effort to protect state-run telecoms&#39; profits, particularly in early years when FaceTime would have consumed a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth.

The UAE is believed to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-30-uae-surveillance-iphone-hacking.html">hacked dissidents&#39; iPhones</a> to spy on their activities, and live video chats might make that surveillance difficult.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on this reprieve lasting long as a result. If this does represent a policy change, though, it could represent either an acknowledgment of changing times or simply a matter of practical necessity. Video calls have often been the only way to see friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the UAE ban hasn&#39;t helped matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facetime-calls-uae-155613828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41e40b29-75be-4c4f-8fe1-f131e2d3c33a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 15:56:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633881379</ingested><modified>2021-10-10T15:56:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75e50fa0-29dd-11ec-a64d-608b3ed49778" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75e50fa0-29dd-11ec-a64d-608b3ed49778" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GCShutter via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Waving to his family from overseas, a young middle eastern man connects with his family via video conferencing late at night thanks to a digital tablet.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arab enjoying his late night video conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory could produce EVs as soon as November]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-tesla-gigafactory-german-court-permission.html">long-in-the-making German Gigafactory</a> is close to manufacturing its first electric cars.

It&#39;ll help you keep track of your baby&#39;s heart rate, blood oxygen levels and hours slept, with warnings if there&#39;s an unusual spike. While the sock won&#39;t fully replace in-person checks, it could set your mind at ease and let you focus on those moments when you&#39;re truly needed. The third-generation footwear provides quicker, more accurate readings as well as considerably easier charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that said, there are no guarantees of a flawless experience. We found the Smart Sock 3 didn&#39;t fit quite as well as its predecessor and was more prone to disconnection alerts. Your circumstances may vary, but don&#39;t be surprised if you get the occasional false alarm. And babies will be babies — there&#39;s the chance your young one will kick the sensor off in the middle of the night.

The Japanese government would reportedly cover up to half of the $7 billion investment.</p><p>The plant would provide chips for cameras, cars and other purposes. Accordingly, car parts giant Denso is supposedly interested in the project. If the project moves forward, the factory would be up and running by 2024.

Nathan Ingraham reviewed the newest base iPad as well as the Microsoft Surface Go 3, the latter of which he says lacks the processing power to be more than a secondary machine. Devindra Hardawar reviewed Windows 11, which he called both refined and frustrating, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio, which he enjoyed but found it to be underpowered for the price. Also, Dana Wollman checked out the Surface Pro 8 two-in-one, which solved some problems but created others with its new, higher price tag.</p><h2>Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 8 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">still lacks an included keyboard</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/48ad27b0-2533-11ec-bf8d-9ea5dda4a116" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 8, photographed from behind on a roof deck." data-uuid="c6be54e9-b8c1-3ece-a234-1acb453c3ae8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>Dana Wollman was pleased to see that the <a href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm">Surface Pro 8</a> addressed some of our complaints about the previous version. It has a redesigned, larger display with skinnier bezels, improved resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, along with 11th-gen Core i5 and i7 processors and a slightly higher-res rear camera. But the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:detachable keyboard" href="https://fave.co/3iKjLuG">detachable keyboard</a> is still sold separately for $180, and the two-in-one starts off more expensive at $1,100. It’s also 15 percent heavier at 1.96 pounds without the keyboard. Dana says that’s lighter than her MacBook Pro, but that doesn’t make it an ideal mobile device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The built-in kickstand seems to indicate the machine is best used when docked, not held. Dana said the kickstand is premium, albeit a bit awkward to pull out due to the narrow divots. She was underwhelmed by the images from the 10-megapixel rear camera, though it can record in 4K, and she was more impressed by the webcam that proved to be capable even in mixed lighting. The 120Hz refresh rate is a major improvement and she says you won’t want to revert back to 60Hz even if it helps save a bit of battery life. She also appreciated the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Slim Pen 2" href="https://fave.co/3hZdvPr">Slim Pen 2</a>, which has a haptic motor that made it fun to use. However, she admits that the higher price point makes the Surface Pro 8 even more of a niche item.</p><h2>The Surface Go 3 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-review-130025822.html">still isn’t powerful enough</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ea60e80-286b-11ec-a4ee-30d98f2cf213" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="f9fa1122-790c-370f-96ed-0bd2657c258b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham likes many of the features of the<a href="https://fave.co/2YrJdOv"> Surface Go 3</a>: it’s well-built, has a lovely and responsive touchscreen, a strong kickstand and is extremely light and portable. However, like the Surface Pro 8, it doesn’t come with a keyboard and you’ll definitely need one as Windows 11 still doesn’t offer up a stellar tablet experience. The bigger issue for him was the underpowered specs and average battery life. The model he reviewed came with a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p>That makes for a mostly capable machine for basic tasks, but Nathan experienced occasional music stutters and had to reload tabs during his workday. He noticed lag while working in Adobe Lightroom, and had issues during video calls while jumping into other programs. During his normal work routine, the battery lasted five hours, which detracts from the device’s portability. However, he liked the 10.5-inch, 1,920 x 1,280 touchscreen and the 3:2 aspect ratio as well as the infinitely adjustable kickstand. While Nathan says he can see the Surface Go 3 working as a secondary machine for travel, it’s hard to recommend as a daily driver because of its performance and battery life issues.</p><h2>The Surface Laptop Studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-studio-review-better-surface-book-130019425.html">could use more cores</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4aa466f0-286c-11ec-9fff-f65cace9fa40" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="9862263e-101e-382c-aae3-19d69e443753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the first Windows 11 PCs, the <a href="https://fave.co/3FhRGVg">Surface Laptop Studio</a> has a 14.4-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate and weighs around four pounds. Devindra Hardawar says while it’s clearly not trying to be an ultraportable, it is ultra-adjustable thanks to the display that tilts it into various angles. The display itself entranced him with its flexible hinge, fantastic Dolby Vision support and refresh rate, though it is surrounded by chunkier bezels. He said the speakers are surprisingly powerful thanks to the two subwoofers on the sides and the tweeters blasting through the keyboard.</p><p>While Devindra found the Laptop Studio to be a solid performer for everyday computing tasks — and fast enough to play <em>Overwatch</em> at 90 and 100fps — it has only a quad-core chip, and that makes it hard to recommend when so many similar machines feature more powerful six- or eight-core CPUs. He was also annoyed by the anemic port situation: two USB-C ports, which support ThunderBolt 4, and a proprietary Surface Connect slot, but there’s no longer an SD card slot, which would have been an opportunity to outdo the competition. At least Microsoft included the excellent keyboard from the Book 3 and the new Surface Slim Pen 2. While Devindra genuinely liked using the Surface Laptop Studio, he said he still wanted more power overall.</p><h2>Windows 11 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">polished and secure — but frustrating</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13245fe0-286d-11ec-bfda-764440259319" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Windows 11" data-uuid="d86ca40d-7507-32c4-9347-3ffa3b42dfee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar doesn’t think that Microsoft is trying to fix much with Windows 11. Although the new operating system is more of a coat of paint over Windows 10, he doesn’t feel that’s a problem. Devindra says the more he uses the OS, the easier it is to see how far the small design tweaks have taken the software. The taskbar now has centered icons, the Start menu has a redesigned look with pinned apps, windows have rounded corners and the icons, Explorer and Settings apps look sharp making for a more refined feel overall.</p><p>The system requirements are a bit more rigid: compatible Intel, AMD or Qualcomm processor, 4GB RAM, at least 64GB storage and you’ll have to enable Secure Boot and Trust Platform Module 2.0 which make it harder for spyware and malware to attack. This means there are some additional complications if you’ve got older hardware or if you’ve built your own PC. Windows 11 will also be the only way to use Microsoft’s DirectStorage technology, which Devindra says should dramatically speed up load times when it’s available. He says that the combination of a refreshed look, additional security and faster performance is a step forward — just not a momentous one.</p><h2>The 2021 iPad is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">an incremental update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75ca8b70-286c-11ec-baff-1457a41f10fa" alt="Apple iPad 2021" data-uuid="873f6c01-1868-3129-a513-aabc5ad3c062"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iM9nm2">2021 refreshed iPad</a> isn’t for early adopters like Nathan Ingraham. The updated tablet now includes a 12-megapixel front camera with Center Stage support, double the base amount of storage, the new A13 Bionic chip and iPad OS 15. However, the hardware is largely unchanged from the previous two versions. It has basically the same size and weight and still includes a 10.2-inch, 2,160 x 1,620 touchscreen, an 8-megapixel rear camera and a Lightning port for charging.</p><p>That means that this is an iPad meant for those who want a tablet that’s fast, lightweight, easy to carry around and (relatively) cheap. For most standard iPad users — those who use a tablet primarily for things like playing games or browsing the web — the new chipset will provide more than enough power. Nathan didn’t notice any slowdowns while multitasking with several open apps, though he did notice that some apps needed to refresh more frequently during those periods. Also, while the screen was serviceable for watching videos and playing games, it can’t compare to the screens on the other iPads in the lineup. But for $330, as Nathan says, who cares? If your iPad is more than a few years old, you&#39;ll find some significant improvements in this one.</p><h2>The Fitbit Charge 5 has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html">slick full-color display</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9af3ca10-286c-11ec-bf7d-e5cc1c8b2f03" alt="Fitbit Charge 5" data-uuid="8ce5c1b6-c6cb-32ec-aa63-3aa4fd799cda"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino/Engadget</div></figure><p>Though the first thing you’ll notice about the new <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYwK4m">Fitbit Charge 5</a> is the 1.04-inch color AMOLED touchscreen. Valentina Palladino says that the changes made to the wearable — rounded edges and a 10-percent thinner body — made it more comfortable to wear as well. The fitness band also now has some more advanced features like ECG measurements and EDA monitoring for stress levels. The ECG measuring is coming soon and Valentina said that the EDA monitoring wasn’t intuitive and left her frustrated. She had better luck with the built-in GPS, which immediately picked up her location and accurately mapped her running route.</p><p>Valentina also liked the alarm and timer apps, which she found helpful throughout the day. However, she was disappointed that Fitbit removed some of the music-focused features, which meant she had to pull out her phone to skip a track or control playback. She was also a bit irked to see that some of the Charge 5’s more advanced metrics, like select sleep and exercise data, were part of Fitbit’s subscription service that costs $10 per month. But she did applaud the battery life and the inclusion of Fitbit Pay with NFC. She says if what you’re looking for is a low-profile wearable with a focus on fitness and a multi-day battery life, then the Charge 5 will fit the bill.</p><h2>The updated Sonos Beam has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html">immersive Dolby Atmos sound</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c71a6ea0-286c-11ec-b6ff-879f089ddfc3" alt="Sonos Beam Gen 2" data-uuid="3fac218a-62e0-3cb3-8868-75b9b57a9ae7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says there was plenty to like about the first-gen Sonos Beam. When it comes to the <a href="https://fave.co/3Dot5MJ">Beam Gen 2</a>, he says the addition of Dolby Atmos means the device can deliver a wider, more immersive soundscape. With largely the same hardware — a center tweeter, four mid-woofers and three passive radiators — this soundbar relies on more processing power to simulate the Dolby Atmos experience. Devindra says it worked surprisingly well during his testing, but wasn’t a replacement for having actual speakers dedicated to blasting height channels.</p><p>He liked that the Beam Gen 2 was still surprisingly compact at 25.6 inches wide and weighing six pounds, and that it has the same Ethernet, HDMI and power ports on the rear. And he appreciated how easy the set up was via Sonos’s app. In testing, the new Beam excelled during action movies: while watching <em>Baby Driver, </em>Devindra said it was a richer experience and even the dialog sounded clearer, too. However, music playback wasn’t as dramatically different and Dolby Atmos support for Amazon Music will come later this year. Sonos also makes it easy to synchronize audio throughout your home and the Alexa integration works well. Devindra says it’s a solid sub-$500 soundbar to take your movie-watching up a notch.</p><h2>The Uno Synth Pro can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uno-synth-pro-review-ik-multimedia-shows-its-serious-about-hardware-120008688.html">produce glorious sounds</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e92703f0-286c-11ec-ac9f-494818b47de2" alt="Uno Synth Pro" data-uuid="06734cf2-7839-34dc-82ce-ccbf55520830"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>With three oscillators, two envelopes, two LFOs, two filters, an analog overdrive and twelve digital effects, the <a href="https://fave.co/3BXOAmF">Uno Synth Pro</a> offers plenty of options for sound design. Terrence O’Brien tested the smaller $400 Desktop model, which features a set of touch keys and an all-plastic body (the synth also comes in a standard $650 Pro model with a 37-key Fatar keybed and a partially metal chassis). He said that the overall construction feels solid enough, the buttons are decent, the knobs offer good resistance and the screen, while small, provides all the information you need.</p><p>However, the gray, black and red color scheme made it difficult to quickly spot the controls, especially in darker environments. He also didn’t like the four top knobs that change all the parameters. But Terrence said his biggest issue was with the touch keys and strips — they felt unresponsive and would occasionally fail to detect touches, which was worse in three-voice paraphone mode. The pitch and mod strips behaved similarly. But his frustrations were largely forgotten once the synth started making noise: Terrence said the oscillators have body and grit and the saw wave just rips. Overall, he was impressed enough with the wealth of sound design tools and the quality of the oscillators and filters to call himself a convert.</p><h2>Owlet’s Smart Sock Plus can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/owlet-smart-sock-plus-review-130525360.html">keep monitoring older kids</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3c986790-286d-11ec-bffd-b624ae98f5a6" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus" data-uuid="115f4cc6-fb5b-3320-ab0a-94a79692406b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>After using both the second- and third-generation Smart Socks on my twins, I’d grown accustomed to being able to check in on their stats anytime from my phone. When they aged out of their socks, it was an uncomfortable transition — for me. Owlet says I’m not alone: 72 percent of the users they polled indicated they’d like to keep using the device to measure their children’s heart rate and pulse ox levels. In response the company updated its algorithm and made the <a href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Smart Sock Plus</a>, which can accommodate children up to five years old or 55 pounds.</p><p>Aside from the larger sock and better algorithm, the Smart Sock Plus is much the same as the standard, third-gen device. In testing, the Plus seemed to fit better but I had to employ work-arounds to keep my kids from taking them off. I also noticed fewer alerts about a misaligned sock, which was a welcome update. At $359 the Smart Sock Plus is pretty pricey for new users, but the <a href="https://fave.co/3kOe1ld">$69 expansion pack</a> available for existing customers is likely to do well as it extends the life time of the sock considerably.</p><h2>The Nintendo Switch OLED edition is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html">nice, but not necessary</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/683e4360-286d-11ec-b7ef-dae243876eb6" alt="Nintendo Switch OLED" data-uuid="893aa67c-5edb-3872-a6f8-bd413dfd716a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus/Engadget</div></figure><p>Kris Naudus is plain: the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/3FoGKVX">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, while lovely, isn’t a must-have. Though the refreshed handheld system features a brighter, 7-inch OLED screen, a new stand ideal for tabletop mode, an Ethernet port and a new coating which feels good in hand, not much has changed under the hood. The CPU and GPU remain the same, ensuring the future game titles will be compatible with existing Switch and Switch Light devices, and the infamous Joy-Cons haven’t been redesigned (though hopefully the drift issues have been solved).</p><p>Kris was impressed by the new stand, which is a Surface-style panel that stretches the length of the entire unit and can be left in any angle you prefer. However, because the USB-C port is still on the bottom which means it can’t be charged while set in tabletop mode. She also liked the slimmer bezels and coating on the frame and said the new buttons look sleeker and feel better. It’s the same height and width as the original Switch, too, so it will fit with all existing accessories. And though the battery is the same, it appears to be more power-efficient thanks to the new OLED screen. Despite that, Kris says unless you’ve given up your original or really need the OLED screen, you’ll be fine sticking with your current system.</p><h2>The Carol smart exercise bike is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carol-rehiit-smart-exercise-bike-142103038.html">for big pocketbooks</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Image of the CAROL REHIIT Smart Bike." data-uuid="886b3efd-bd45-333e-b035-a17e441db8b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Daniel Cooper would tell you that he enjoyed his time with the pricey <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Carol smart exercise bike" href="https://fave.co/3mzUvZl">Carol smart exercise bike</a>, a machine intended to be used in short workouts of eight minutes and 40 seconds. Using the methods employed by Reduced Exertion, High Intensity Interval Training (REHIIT), the bike features exercise videos that you can follow via the 10.1-inch color touchscreen if you subscribe to the company’s service. Because the screen is a Lenovo tablet, you can run third-party apps through it like Peloton’s so you could take classes from there, to. Daniel says the Carol app is clean and colorful: the UI flashes when you hit a high intensity phase and power output visualizations were particularly great.</p><p>The bike itself looks like any at-home exercise bike with a large, real-slung flywheel and a drive unit to house the system to electronically control the resistance. The short handles contain heart rate-monitoring electrodes and the height of the handlebars and seat height and distance are all adjustable. After spending time with it, Daniel admits he feels like his fitness and mood both improved, but the $2,400 price tag is especially hard to swallow.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsofts-new-surface-devices-160051290.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96d5919d-183e-461c-b33d-a73d604ee5f0</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 16:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633725557</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T20:39:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8cc17e1-2574-11ec-9deb-e92802e50499" width="2000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8cc17e1-2574-11ec-9deb-e92802e50499" width="2000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Perserverance rover pinpoints its best chances of finding ancient Mars life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA landed the Perseverance rover in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mars-perseverance-rover-sample-water-presence-173031732.html">Mars&#39; Jezero Crater</a> knowing it had the potential for signs of ancient life, but now it&#39;s clearer where the rover should be looking. Scientists have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-perseverance-sheds-more-light-on-jezero-crater-s-watery-past">published</a> a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4051">study</a> (the first from Perservance since landing) providing insights into where the rover can &quot;best hunt&quot; for traces of past microbial life.
