The Axon 30 is a direct sequel to the Axon 20, which was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-front-selfie-camera-140003878.html">first phone to feature an in-screen camera</a>. However, the company has subsequently released the Axon 30 Pro and Ultra in some territories. So, weirdly, the vanilla Axon 30 is the last of the Axon 30 family to appear.</p><p>At $500, it’s also the cheapest — another attempt by ZTE to slide underneath the priciest smartphones around and offer a mixture of compelling features, albeit tempered by some compromises. The Axon 30’s headline feature is a much-improved under-display camera (UDC), which is almost invisible. It’s also a ZTE smartphone that’s launching in the US, which doesn’t always happen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But with increasingly strong midrange phone competition from the likes of Samsung, OnePlus and Google, does ZTE’s Axon 30 offer more than just a hidden selfie camera?</p><p>So what’s all the fuss about that camera anyway? Well, the under-screen 16-megapixel selfie shooter on the $500 Axon 30 puts the one on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 to shame. ZTE’s implementation is imperceptible unless you really, really look for it. No punch hole, no notch, no pop-up camera.</p><p>In comparison, the Fold 3’s selfie cam has a pixelated effect that signposts where the camera is and ruins the whole effect. (Yes, in Samsung’s defense, there’s another front-facing camera on the Fold 3 when it’s closed and you’re using the smaller screen.)</p><p>The difference seems to be pixel density, or according to ZTE, the composition of them, with a “special pixel matrix” that ensures the screen appears at 400 PPI — double that found on the Axon 20. If the light catches the unit just right, then yes, you can see it. You’ll probably never notice it again.</p><p>There’s also a dedicated UDC chip that apparently works to keep the camera area looking consistent with the rest of the screen. To get a closer look, I used Oppo’s Find X3 Pro, which has a microscope phone camera — perfect for visually explaining what could otherwise get very technical.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1e4cce0-1643-11ec-bdff-65a10a81eed6" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="ecb3519d-46cf-33cf-be2f-dab8e0641e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>As you can see, some pixels seem slightly smaller, or dimmer, than those surrounding them. In this close up you can see the outline of the UDC area, but at this magnification, it’s impressive that it doesn’t look more out of place. I’ll touch on the camera’s performance later, but spoiler: While it might look the part, it’s not quite capable enough.</p><p>The hidden sensor also complements the expansive 6.92-inch AMOLED screen, uninterrupted by the presence of any camera notches or holes. With a 2,460 x 1,080 resolution panel and 120Hz refresh rate, the Axon 30 is offering a flagship screen for mid-range prices. You can switch between 120 and 60Hz modes, with an automatic option letting the Axon 30 decide when to increase the frequency. On more expensive phones, like the OnePlus 9 Pro and the recently-announced<a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html"> iPhone Pro 13</a>, there are more refresh rate options that dip even lower, but at this price, this seems like a fair compromise.</p><p>Leaving it on auto is probably the best fit for most folks, but the manual options are nice — especially as there seems to be a tangible battery life benefit to the lower setting.</p><p>The phone itself is pretty big but feels solid despite its plastic back. ZTE added a translucent reflective effect across the rear of the Axon 30, which I like. I’m less enamored with the giant camera unit, however, which protrudes a few millimeters from the phone, and is likely to be more easily dinged and scratched. Sadly, this design is now everywhere.</p><p>The screen might be comparable to a high-end phone, but there are some features that didn’t make the cut at this price, like wireless charging and certified resistance against dust and water.</p><p><strong>Performance and software</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1243e550-1571-11ec-a35e-0d3efbfffa54" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="e6fc0689-11b6-342b-9305-3211a1614f15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>There are further compromises. The Axon 30 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 processor — which is a little underpowered compared to the Snapdragon 880 and 880 Plus we’re seeing in flagship Android smartphones now.</p><p>But at $500, phones like the Pixel 5a (and its Snapdragon 765G chip) are a better comparison to make. The Axon 30 has a more powerful chip than Google’s latest device, though it’s hard to notice a difference in performance between the two.</p><p>The Axon 30 handled everything I threw at it, whether that was video streaming, Stadia or playing games on the phone itself. (The Stadia app did flag that the phone wasn’t officially supported, although it worked fine for me.) There was some visible slowdown when recording video at full 4K resolution, and hopping into the gallery, but otherwise, I didn’t have many complaints.</p><p>I also have to mention that the Axon 30 isn’t exactly great for 5G support in the US. It only works on T-Mobile’s midband 5G. If you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;T, you’ll be relegated to 4G.</p><p>ZTE does know what it’s doing with smartphone power, though. The phone has a 4,200mAh battery that, when I turned the 120Hz refresh rate off, lasted a good two days of typical use before I needed to recharge. And when I did need to, it took hardly any time.</p><p>The Axon 30 supports incredibly fast charging speeds of up to 65W with the appropriate charger, which (thankfully) the phone comes with. ZTE estimates it can charge the phone to 100 percent in under an hour, but getting to 50 percent takes proportionately less time — around 20 minutes.</p><p>Software is pretty innocuous, which is generally a good thing. ZTE keeps pretty close to the stock Google experience. Its new MyOS 11 skin, based on Android 11, is pretty close to what you’d find on a Pixel. There are a few gesture quirks (shake the Axon 30 for the flashlight!) and a floating shortcut widget that can be minimized to the edges of the screen. It’s similar to Samsung’s Edge panel on its bigger phones. ZTE’s version is called Z-Pop and you can tweak the four shortcuts for system commands and app switching. That said, it’s not something that makes you think “Mmm what a memorable experience this is.”</p><p></p><h3>Cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124c97e0-1571-11ec-a75b-f4c08389583e" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="15b1c40a-7bb5-35cb-b408-cf9ce34ddafd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>While the front-facing 16-megapixel camera is technically impressive, it doesn’t take great selfies. Don’t get me wrong, it shoots far better pics than the UDC on both Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Axon 20. The work done to pixel-bin for low light performance, as well as algorithms to help the camera ‘see’ through the AMOLED panel make this the best UDC so far. But it still offers up middling to poor photos. It’s a bit of a time warp, to be honest, giving me the kind of pictures I used to get on smartphones years ago. Details are fuzzy, and any strong backlighting leads to lens flares and washout.</p><p>There’s also an AI assist mode that doesn’t seem to help much — if anything, modes like brightness seem to wash out skin tones even further, and they’re a little gray to begin with. Even if you turn this off, images seem pretty unnatural.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3d582710-1643-11ec-b766-ba2f99c72f3d" alt="ZTE Axon 30 samples" data-uuid="d27e495c-7fce-3801-bc61-5faf14aae13f"><figcaption>I couldn&#39;t mask how disappointed I was in these selfies.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>It does still capture enough detail to offer face unlock functionality if you prefer that method to fingerprint unlock. And yes, there’s also a fingerprint reader built into the screen. Face unlock worked fine for me nine times out of ten, and was plenty fast enough, but I used a combination of the two. Fingerprint unlock seemed more reliable in darker environments.</p><p>But what about the rest of the cameras? On the back, the Axon 30 has a four-camera array, led by a 64-megapixel Sony sensor. While you’ll mostly be taking pictures that fuse a lot of these pixels together for less noise and better performance in low-light, ZTE has kept the ability to take full-resolution stills if you want to. There’s also an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 5-megapixel macro camera and finally, a 2-megapixel depth sensor to aid your bokeh photography efforts and help with focus. You get up to 2x optical zoom, which is what you’d generally expect at this price point.</p><p>While shooting pictures with the Axon 30 during a family event, images of friends and family seemed particularly good. There is a softness to some shots, likely due to the photos being shrunk down from the 64-megapixel original, but the phone was able to handle most things I threw at it.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d271d4f23b974ac682bfd836cdcc2da6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b37a2d0-1642-11ec-bd3f-9ec869f25ab3" alt="ZTE Axon 30 sample images"></section><p>There’s a night mode — of course — but the Axon 30 takes pretty functional shots in low light without having to resort to using it. It did help further reduce noise and improve detail a little, but I’d also advise testing shots with AI mode on and off, as sometimes I found it meddled a little too heavily, especially with people as subjects.</p><p>And the macro camera isn’t worth your time. I suggest using the primary camera with zoom for generally better results in most situations. The problem with the macro camera seems to be that the phone has to be so close to the subject that it blocks a lot of light. That’s not great for detail-oriented photography.</p><p>Video camera modes are generally the same across most mid-range phones in recent years, and the Axon 30 isn’t hugely different. It can handle up to 4K at 60fps and a multi-camera mode lets you record from both the wide-angle and the primary camera at the same time, which is a nice trick we’ve occasionally seen on flagship phones. Due to sluggish autofocus, however, the recording quality isn’t great. If you’ve got a stable subject and good light, videos will generally come out nicely. At other times, you’ll struggle to record anything functional. Just because a phone can record 4K, it doesn’t mean you should.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1224c490-1571-11ec-afcf-825b32632843" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="6e71016f-7a16-3e39-8320-d41ca3582a07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>With the Axon 30, ZTE has proved it can successfully camouflage its under-display camera. But that doesn’t mean it’s up to the task. Image quality from the secretive selfie lens really isn’t good enough, even if the implementation is impressive. Aside from that, the Axon 30 has a gorgeous, fluid screen and a decent rear camera setup. The lack of wider 5G support in the US is frustrating in a 2021 phone, but there is still a lot here for $500. The bigger challenge is that competition is tough in the middleweight phone arena. Google’s latest Pixel, the 5a, rings in at $450, and offers better-performing cameras, front and back. If you’re struggling to pick between the two, the decision loosely boils down to a bigger screen or better selfies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b5a2e5b-32ba-4e1e-b89b-825f5a87f0fc</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:32:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632152511</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:42:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124ce600-1571-11ec-acdc-e652b6376c24" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124cbef0-1571-11ec-ad7b-052195c49d14" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the debut of new Echo Show 8 and Show 5 devices in June, we&#39;ve seen a few good deals on Amazon&#39;s first-generation smart displays since then.

While the Echo Show 5 excels as a smart alarm clock, the Echo Show 8 lets you watch videos, view photos and check out security camera feeds with a bit more comfort. The larger display is also better for video chats and it has a physical camera shutter (along with a microphone on/off button) for when you want extra privacy. If the Show 5 is a bit too small for you but the $250 Echo Show 10 is too expensive (or you&#39;re freaked out by its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">swiveling base</a>), the Show 8 will likely hit a sweet spot with its power, screen real estate and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:updated Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3tTqdUo">updated Echo Show 8</a> is only a few months old but it&#39;s much pricer at $130 and it&#39;s not significantly different from the first-generation. It has a faster octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera with auto-framing, which means it will automatically pan to track your face and keep you in view during video calls. This feature also works with all video chat services that the device supports, including Skype and Zoom, so it will come in handy if you frequently make calls with the Show 8. But you could safely skip the 2021 model if you mostly use your smart displays for weather alerts, calendar appointments, music streaming and other basic tasks.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-generation-echo-show-8-is-on-sale-for-64-right-now-152439302.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f25da33-177b-41ef-be12-f9bfb9225bd5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:24:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632151481</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:24:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter will pay over $800 million t​o settle a class action suit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418091/000119312521276828/d197034d8k.htm"><ins>agreed to pay</ins></a> $809.5 million to settle a class action suit filed by shareholders in 2016.

Now, it&#39;s integrating another Apple product, Shazam, into its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-12-algoriddim-djay-for-ios-free-pro-dj-software.html">iOS djay app</a> with the release of iOS 15. The new feature lets you can scan your surroundings and identify any song playing, whether at an event, listening to the radio or playing sets with other DJs. Once it picks out the song, djay will instantly load it onto the virtual decks and play it in sync with the external music source.&nbsp;</p><p>Once loaded, you can create a mix with similar tracks, remix the song, apply effects and deconstruct it into components using the company&#39;s Neural Mix tech. It can also save songs into iOS 15&#39;s music recognition history in the control center, &quot;providing users with streamlined access to all of their song discoveries,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a9306fc9ad0d46f49fd10cd12fe623ed"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvcvaJzRDaQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>While this sounds like cool technology in search of an application, Algoriddim has a few use cases in mind. The main one is that you can identify a track you might hear and get it into your library with the tap of a button, or create an automated mix based on the recognized song. &quot;djay can instantly provide you with similar tracks to the one you just heard, allowing you to quickly immerse yourself in a particular style,&quot; Algoriddim told Engadget.&nbsp;</p><p>Another, more marginal use case is with back-to-back DJing. If you&#39;re playing in tandem with another DJ or in a lineup, you can pick up where the last DJ left off by identifying and syncing with their song before phasing into your own set. This goes a step beyond beat matching, letting you match the last DJ&#39;s song exactly. Mind you, many DJs may not care to replay the last DJ’s song or work with a playlist inspired by it, especially if they weren’t familiar with the tracks</p><p>The Shazam-enhanced version of iOS djay lets you save recognized music to your Tidal (music and video), SoundCloud, Beatport and Beatsource libraries (not Spotify or Apple Music). Other new features include the ability to add effects to the master audio output, enabled by new Audio Unit (extensions) features in iOS 15. That will let you better tailor the sound for broadcast or to match a PA system. Algoriddim&#39;s iOS djay update for iOS is <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/djay-ios">now available</a> for free, or you can get the Pro version for $6.99 per month or $49.99 per year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/algoriddims-djay-i-os-app-uses-shazam-to-recognize-and-sync-with-live-music-140001218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb021e0a-c118-424b-a769-ffddd4e7dbbf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632144348</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T13:26:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/481717a0-1a0e-11ec-9dfb-92bcc8328bb6" width="2000" height="1196" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/481717a0-1a0e-11ec-9dfb-92bcc8328bb6" width="2000" height="1196" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Algoriddim]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Algoriddim's djay iOS app uses Shazam to recognize and sync live music]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Algoriddim's djay iOS app uses Shazam to recognize and sync live music]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's new Streaming Stick 4K gets Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and better Wi-Fi]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roku&#39;s $50 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-02-roku-4k-streaming-stick-players.html">Streaming Stick 4K</a> has been one of our favorite devices for years. It&#39;s cheap, pocketable and has just about every feature you&#39;d want in a streaming gadget. This year, Roku is finally adding a long-awaited feature to its new 4K stick: Dolby Vision HDR. That&#39;s something the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-ultra-dolby-vision-streaming-player-130015662.html">Roku Ultra started supporting last year</a>, and it&#39;s a particularly big deal for home theater fans. Additionally, the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Streaming Stick 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3AvIn16">Streaming Stick 4K</a> boots up around 30 percent faster than before, and its revamped wireless receiver makes Wi-Fi speeds up to twice as fast, according to Roku.</p><p>Like the HDR10 format, Dolby Vision allows for higher peak brightness levels and more nuanced dark scenes. But it can also do so dynamically, tweaking its contrast and brightness levels for every individual frame in a film or TV show. That&#39;s something HDR10 can&#39;t do, though it&#39;s since been added to the newer HDR10+ format, which the new 4K streaming stick also supports. There&#39;s a lot more Dolby Vision content out there today, though, so I&#39;d wager most people would be more excited for Dolby Vision than HDR10+ support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a0df40-1981-11ec-bafd-7e2bcfaa2c26" alt="Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021" data-uuid="dec1ca0a-4a07-356b-8dde-ec029fc2626c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roku</div></figure><p>While the 4K streaming stick ships with Roku&#39;s standard voice remote, you can also opt for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$70 Streaming Stick 4K+ bundle" href="https://amzn.to/2XtRv7O">$70 Streaming Stick 4K+ bundle</a>, which packs in the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-express-4k-rechargeable-remote-130031381.html">Voice Remote Pro</a>. Normally a $30 upgrade, that smarter clicker adds hands-free voice searching (instead of hitting a button), as well as a rechargeable battery. And if you&#39;re looking for something a bit more powerful, the $80 Wal-Mart exclusive Roku Ultra LT is also getting Dolby Vision, a faster processor and better Wi-Fi this year.</p><p>For most people, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K is likely all the streaming player you need. You can get faster speeds and more connectivity with the $100 Roku Ultra, or a nicer interface and game ecosystem with the $179 Apple TV 4K. But when it comes to just streaming video in the best possible formats, there&#39;s little need to spend more than $50. You&#39;ll be able to find the new Roku Streaming Stick 4K sometime mid-October in the US, and in the coming months across Canada, Mexico and other Latin American countries.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-dolby-vision-hdr10-130040918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e38e48c-8d94-4f23-af98-582c97aad3cd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632145473</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T13:44:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a01bf0-1981-11ec-bb6c-770f56943208" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a01bf0-1981-11ec-bb6c-770f56943208" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5 adds better voice support, 5.1 Roku speaker configurations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-dolby-vision-hdr10-130040918.html">Roku&#39;s new Streaming Stick 4K </a>to take advantage of its latest software features. The Roku OS 10.5 update, which will roll out to players and TVs in the next few weeks, will be jam-packed with features to make your streaming life easier. There&#39;s expanded Roku Voice support, which will let you ask players (with supported remotes) to start playing content from Netflix, Spotify and most other channels. And the company has added a Live TV Channel Guide to help find free TV content (so far there are more than 200 live channels to sift through).</p><p>But more importantly for the Roku faithful, there are even more configurations for the company&#39;s wireless speakers. Roku OS 10.5 will let you use any of the company&#39;s soundbars — the Streambar, Streambar Pro and Smart Soundbar — as a center channel flanked by Roku wireless speakers. Put that setup together with two more rear speakers and a wireless sub, and voila, you&#39;ve got a full-fledged 5.1 surround solution. Previously, you were only able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-roku-surround-sound-speakers-soundbar.html">use Roku&#39;s soundbars as all of your front channels</a> (left, right and center).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddc1150-1983-11ec-beff-a85753283c69" alt="Roku OS 10.5" data-uuid="605257c6-0359-3d4f-87f0-e476883d6bce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roku</div></figure><p>From what I recall of Roku&#39;s earlier surround solution, it sounded more than adequate for a small room. I haven&#39;t heard the company&#39;s 5.1 setup yet, but generally having more speakers is always better. At the very least, you can expect clearer dialog and better front channel separation. I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s worth shelling out up to  $630 for all of Roku&#39;s speakers ($300 for four wireless speakers, $180 for the StreamBar Pro, and $150 for the wireless subwoofer), but it&#39;s nice to have the flexibility to build out a full system if you&#39;ve already invested in a few of them.</p><p>Roku OS 10.5 will also add some audio improvements for headphones. When you connect a wireless headset to the Roku mobile app, it will adjust your sync settings based on the type of headphone you&#39;re using. You&#39;ll also be able to use your smartphone camera to adjust the audio delay even further. That&#39;s a useful feature for anyone using Bluetooth headphones, where audio delay issues are fairly common.</p><p>To coincide with expanded Spotify voice support, Roku is also adding a new music and podcasts row to its system search. You&#39;ll be able to see results from Spotify&#39;s entire library, but more importantly it opens the door for better audio app support on Roku OS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-os-10-5-update-voice-speakers-130013021.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b45363a-b4d0-432a-998b-88a8f0b0e8c5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632082837</ingested><modified>2021-09-19T20:20:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddbc330-1983-11ec-9c1f-88e0d0fcc21b" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddbc330-1983-11ec-9c1f-88e0d0fcc21b" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: 12 years in jail for unlocking smartphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The mastermind behind a seven-year scheme to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-phones-unlocked-fraud-prison-sentence-194554103.html"><ins>illegally unlock AT&amp;T handsets has been sentenced to 12 years in jail</ins></a>.

The covering supposedly reflects 98.1 percent of all solar radiation, theoretically leaving the surface <em>cooler</em> than the surrounding environment.

A comparison chart on Amazon&#39;s Canadian and Mexican sites, now removed, showed new Kindle Paperwhite and Paperwhite Signature Edition models, with 6.8-inch 300 ppi displays and 17 LEDs. The current Paperwhite, by contrast, has a 6-inch display and just four LEDs.&nbsp;</p><p>Both models are IPX8 waterproof as before, offer a &quot;flush-front design&quot; and appear to have narrower side and top bezels.

Any users confirmed to be under 14 will enter a new &quot;youth mode&quot; limited to 40 minutes of usage per day. At the same time, it unveiled a new app called Xiao Qu Xing (&quot;Little Fun Star&quot;), a TikTok-style short video app with limited subject materials, a 40 minute time limit and the ability to like, but not upload or share videos.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of the time restriction, kids in China won&#39;t be able to access Douyin between 10PM and 6AM. The new controls only apply to users who supplied their real names and ages, so to that end, Douyin has asked parents to register their kids&#39; real information. ByteDance also added more content to Douyin with educational subjects like science, art history, history and more. The new app, Xiao Qu Xing, appears to offer exclusively educational content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gaming limits introduced earlier this month are even more restrictive, with under-14s limited to just three hours per week between 8-9PM on Friday, weekends and public holidays. Previously, kids could game for 90 minutes a day and three hours on holidays. The rule change was put in place to combat gaming addiction, regulators said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The TikTok restrictions won&#39;t affect as many kids, however. According to an article in the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3149397/chinese-version-tiktok-limits-kids-under-14-40-minutes-day-adding-fight">South China Morning Post (SCMP)</a>, just 0.34 percent of Douyin users are under 12, with 4.18 percent from 13-19 years old. Those figures are far from certain, though, as Douyin doesn&#39;t publish demographic data.&nbsp;</p><p>It also acknowledged that it might be easy to bypass the new rules. &quot;As the first short video platform to launch minor protection measures, we deeply understand that there will be imperfections,&quot; the company said in a statement. To that end, it has launched a bug-finding campaign seeking &quot;loopholes&quot; in the login process.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tik-tok-china-limits-kids-under-14-to-40-minutes-each-day-091559878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c190bb0f-05b6-42e1-bd67-2b096a846265</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 09:15:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632129361</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T09:16:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/fd8fa760-fd72-11e9-b7f7-3ef3b19b092f" width="3353" height="2236" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/fd8fa760-fd72-11e9-b7f7-3ef3b19b092f" width="3353" height="2236" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[China Stringer Network / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019.

Sjömärke is a Wireless Qi charging pad, but you don&#39;t place it on your desk. Rather, it installs <em>underneath</em> your desk and is held in place either by double-sided tape (included) or 18mm x 6mm screws (not included). Your desktop needs to be made of something like wood or plastic that won&#39;t block the magnetic field, and must have a minimum thickness of 8mm (5/16th of an inch), and a maximum of 22.2mm (7/8th of an inch), according to the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/manuals/sjoemaerke-wireless-charger__AA-2281316-2_pub.pdf">manual</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once you install the pad, plug it in with the six-foot power cable and mark the charging point on your table with the included &quot;X&quot; shaped sticker, you&#39;re ready to charge your phone or other device.

The 2021 edition of the awards was also a watershed year for Apple TV+, which took home 10 Emmys including seven for its comedy series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a>.</p><p>To be sure, a huge chunk of Netflix&#39;s Emmy harvest came from the 34 Creative Arts Emmys it won last week. However, it still took a further 10 primetime Emmys including acting awards for Olivia Colman, Gillian Anderson and Josh O&#39;Connor in <em>The Crown</em>, along with Ewan McGregor in <em>Halston</em>. <em>The Crown</em> also won for writing and directing, while taking the prestigious best drama series prize.

This year, it beat all rivals by a long way, and streaming platforms overall took the top four spots.

As <em>USA Today</em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/17/whitest-paint-created-global-warming/8378579002/">reports</a>, Purdue University researchers have <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q3/purdue-record-for-the-whitest-paint-appears-in-latest-edition-of-guinness-world-records.html">developed</a> an ultra-white paint (it just earned a Guinness World Record) that reflects 98.1 percent of solar radiation while outputting infrared heat. As this leaves the surface cooler than the environment (regular paint warms the surface), it could effectively replace air conditioning in some cases — it produces a cooling power of 10kW for a 1,000sq. ft. roof, or more than a typical house AC unit.</p><p>There are existing paints made to reflect heat, but they reflect no more than 90 percent of sunlight and don&#39;t cool surfaces. The team didn&#39;t have much breathing room, either — an even whiter paint might have compromised it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The trick was to use a high ratio of barium sulfate, a compound you often see in cosmetics and photo paper, in varying particle sizes. The wider range of sizes helps scatter more of the light spectrum and thus reflect more sunlight.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear how close this extremely white paint is to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-benjamin-moore-colorreader.html">your local store</a>, but the researchers are fully bent on commercializing their work. They&#39;ve teamed with a company to mass-produce and sell the paint, and have already filed patents. If it lives up to the billing, though, it could play an important role in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-21-years-behind-emissions-goals-enel-study-180121943.html">fighting climate change</a>.  It could reduce or eliminate the need for air conditioning in some homes, particularly in warm regions with ample sunlight. That could reduce emissions and power consumption, and might save you some money on hot summer days.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ultra-white-paint-eliminates-air-conditioning-211150734.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97a3f35d-e8e2-44a4-9d95-007f498f23ea</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 21:11:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632141146</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T12:32:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c9c1b820-198a-11ec-beff-1a4dfa753af9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c9c1b820-198a-11ec-beff-1a4dfa753af9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Purdue University photo/John Underwood]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ultra-white paint from Purdue University that could eliminate the need for air conditioning in some buildings]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ultra-white paint from Purdue University]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's chief scientist will retire in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA is about to close an important chapter in its history.

New National Transportation Safety Board head Jennifer Homendy told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-push-to-expand-teslas-driver-assistance-to-cities-rankles-a-top-safety-authority-11632043803">interview</a> that Tesla needs to tackle &quot;basic safety issues&quot; before it expands features like Autopilot and Full Self Driving to more parts of the road. She also wasn&#39;t thrilled with Tesla beta-testing upgrades on public streets.</p><p>Like other critics, the NTSB leader took issue with Tesla&#39;s naming schemes for its driver assists. The Full Self Driving label is &quot;misleading and irresponsible,&quot; Homendy said, leading some to &quot;misuse and abuse&quot; it. Despite its name, the current FSD package only enables limited autonomy in some situations, and requires drivers to be ready to take the wheel at any moment. Tesla ultimately hopes for true autonomy to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-cabin-camera-explained-222017515.html">enable robotaxis</a> and other hands-off uses, but hasn&#39;t yet demonstrated such a system.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tesla and its chief Elon Musk have long argued that Autopilot (and by extension FSD) is overall safer than full manual control despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">concerns over crashes</a> where the technology was involved. The automaker has used FSD betas as a way to improve semi-autonomous features through real-world use, not just the ideal conditions of a closed circuit.</p><p>Homendy&#39;s remarks won&#39;t necessarily lead to policies meant to limit or ban Tesla&#39;s technology. However, it does set the tone for the NTSB&#39;s approach to Tesla during the Biden administration.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11</a> machine will reportedly resemble a souped-up, Intel-powered counterpart to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html">Surface Pro X</a> with a 13-inch, narrow-bezel 120Hz display.

As <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/18/cadillac-lyriq-sells-out-in-19-minutes-automakers-still-underestimating-ev-demand/">learned</a>, GM&#39;s luxury badge <a href="https://twitter.com/Cadillac/status/1439323245094883330">sold out</a> of reservations for the Lyriq&#39;s Debut Edition in 10 minutes. The brand didn&#39;t say how many people paid the $100 fee, but it&#39;s clear there was at least some pent-up demand for the upscale electric crossover. More Debut Edition models will be available through dealers in summer 2022.</p><p>Deposits don&#39;t always translate to final sales when the fee is refundable. Some people may reserve a car only to back out when it comes time to make the final purchase. For context, though, VW took eight hours to sell a &quot;few thousand&quot; units of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">the ID.4</a> First Edition. The overall number might be small, but 19 minutes is extremely quick.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The sellout wasn&#39;t completely unexpected. While the Lyriq is still an expensive EV with a nearly $60,000 starting price, it promises a healthy 300-plus miles of range, 190kW fast charging and a sprawling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-offers-a-glimpse-at-the-lyric-evs-33-inch-display-175006045.html">33-inch infotainment display</a>. There&#39;s also a clear pattern of strong demand for EVs from familiar names. Ford, for instance, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ramps-up-f-150-lightning-production-165311045.html">boosting F-150 Lightning production</a> after demand far outstripped early manufacturing targets. There&#39;s clearly an audience for EV like these, even if they&#39;re still far from dominating their combustion engine counterparts.</p><div id="3fcd569528464747a75f5b2b75f234de"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That was fast.💨 Every all-electric 2023 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LYRIQ?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LYRIQ</a> Debut Edition has now been reserved.

Company founder Pavel Durov said Telegram would obey an election law barring campaigning during elections, calling the law &quot;legitimate.&quot;</p><p>The move comes despite the nature of the bots and Durov&#39;s past statements. One of the bots, Smart Voting, was only meant to identify candidates that could unseat the dominant United Russia party, not just Navalny&#39;s Russia of the Future party. Durov also decried Apple and Google removing the Smart Voting mobile app from their respective app stores, calling it a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot; that tolerated censorship.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Russia under Vladimir Putin has routinely cracked down on any political dissent, including actions against Navalny himself (such as an attempted assassination linked to Russian agents) and a long-running effort to quash the broader Smart Voting effort. Officials both threatened Apple and Google with fines and have gone so far as to try and throttle internet infrastructure providing access to Smart Voting.</p><p>Whatever the motivations, the decision underscores the fine line tech firms tend to walk in Russia. While they might object to the Putin regime&#39;s tight grips on politics and speech, they also can&#39;t afford to antagonize the government if they want to have any kind of presence in the country. Telegram may object to Russia&#39;s policies, but it risks depriving residents of a relatively safe avenue for free expression if it defies Russian laws.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/telegram-blocks-russia-navalny-chat-bot-during-vote-211544623.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6daf008f-8664-490a-9aac-26ceb2657bcc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 21:15:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631999747</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T21:15:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/c27a79d0-6170-11eb-b7e1-088f49fc3c0e" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/c27a79d0-6170-11eb-b7e1-088f49fc3c0e" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Telegram Messenger logo on the App Store is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on January 14, 2021.

In a notice on its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/referral-program">website</a> spotted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/17/tesla-ends-referral-program-everything-except-solar-roof/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, Tesla said that &quot;vehicle products and solar panels are no longer eligible for Referral awards&quot; as of September 18th. The company&#39;s only active program at the moment is for the Solar Roof, which awards referrers with monetary rewards of up to $500 and free Powerwalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla&#39;s referral program has changed tremendously over the years. The automaker used to promise new Roadsters for top referrers and up to six months of free Supercharging. That eventually became too expensive to be sustainable, so the company decided to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-17-tesla-ends-customer-referral-program.html">axe the program</a>. Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-21-tesla-new-referral-program.html">introduced</a> a new one with more reasonable rewards shortly after that, though, promising at least 1,000 miles of free Supercharging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it relaunched the program with updated terms, the company said that it &quot;heard from... customers that the Referral Program was one of their favorite reasons to tell their friends about Tesla.&quot; It&#39;s unclear if it would come back again this time for the same reason, but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it does. Take note, however, that Tesla has yet to fulfill some of its bigger promises to referrers. As <em>Electrek</em> notes, it hasn&#39;t delivered the Roadsters its top referrers earned yet, and people have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pqddxj/is_the_tesla_referral_program_done_as_of/hdaj01e/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">complaining</a> on online forums about not receiving free Powerwalls and other rewards from years ago.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-kills-referral-programs-194950736.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a919438-8fb8-4922-a640-5cda07c78d83</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:49:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632146408</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T14:00:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e48158b0-185d-11ec-b3ff-63ea806f78c2" width="1600" height="1015" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e48158b0-185d-11ec-b3ff-63ea806f78c2" width="1600" height="1015" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon has banned over 600 Chinese brands as part of review fraud crackdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you noticed some well-known tech accessory makers disappearing from Amazon? Those aren&#39;t just rare incidents — they&#39;re part of a larger campaign. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy">response</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, Amazon has confirmed a <em>South China Morning Post</em><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3149203/amazon-closes-3000-chinese-brand-online-stores-campaign-against-fake">report</a> that the internet giant has banned over 600 Chinese brands (spread across 3,000 seller accounts) over review fraud incidents.  These firms intentionally and repeatedly violated review policies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-04-amazon-bans-reviews-posted-in-exchange-for-free-products.html">banning incentivized reviews</a>, Amazon said.</p><p>The online retailer first broke word of the figure in an interview with VP Cindy Tai on the state-controlled network China Central Television. It had previously kept relatively quiet on the broader effort.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The crackdown began in earnest five months earlier, but it received wider attention when Amazon banned Aukey and Mpow. The venders were caught offering rewards, including gift cards, for customers leaving reviews. Amazon later booted RAVPower, Vava and other relatively well-known brands for similar behavior. It&#39;s not clear how many non-Chinese brands have faced bans.</p><p>There are signs these vendors are either dodging bans or have otherwise escaped some detection, such as Aukey earbuds under the Key Series brand. However, it&#39;s safe to say the wider anti-fraud strategy has significantly changed Amazon&#39;s marketplace — much to the chagrin of banned companies that heavily depended on Amazon-based sales.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-bans-chinese-brands-for-review-fraud-191820086.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08938d3a-b1c4-4454-b6bd-4ccda286228d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:18:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631992702</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T19:18:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cda4160-18af-11ec-bfff-cf42af4cf180" width="3685" height="2372" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cda4160-18af-11ec-bfff-cf42af4cf180" width="3685" height="2372" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438748063527575555">told Twitter users</a> that Starlink should exit beta &quot;next month&quot; — that is, sometime in October. You could theoretically could use the quicker-than-usual service in more countries, or at least without the stigma of beta testing involved.</p><p>The company had aimed for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">complete worldwide coverage</a> by September. To date, the beta has been largely limited to North America and parts of Europe, with notable exceptions like Australia, Chile and New Zealand. Planned expansions are so far limited to Mexico and Japan, but SpaceX has registered subsidiaries in countries like the Philippines and South Africa.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The formal launch could be crucial. SpaceX said it had shipped 100,000 Starlink terminals as of late August, but that number is likely to swell as the beta label disappears and more countries get access. And while satellite service is far from new, Starlink&#39;s high bandwidth and low latency could help close the gap for broadband in rural areas and developing countries where conventional internet access is either unavailable or too slow to be practical.</p><p>This is, of course, provided Starlink arrives as promised. Musk and his companies have a history of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-29-spacex-starship-first-commercial-flight-2021.html">optimistic timetables</a> for projects that get stalled by technical hurdles and other practical realities. An October launch certainly isn&#39;t out of the question, but you might not want to plan your schedule around that  launch just yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/starlink-beta-end-date-181729796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01a823e5-5444-4f0a-b173-8b243d981a8d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 18:17:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631989051</ingested><modified>2021-09-19T17:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25a46aa0-18a7-11ec-abae-ed4549b57240" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25a46aa0-18a7-11ec-abae-ed4549b57240" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pablo Sanhueza / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Starlink antenna is seen on the roof of the John F Kennedy School located in the village of Sotomo, outside the town of Cochamo, Los Lagos region, Chile, August 7, 2021.
