From <a href="https://twitter.com/gucci/status/1343874405839949826?s=20">Gucci</a> selling digital items in <em>Roblox</em> to <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadids-fantasy-fashion-video-game-collection-march-issue"><em>Vogue</em></a>&#39;s virtual fashion spread starring Gigi Hadid, the two industries are increasingly overlapping to capture a young, tech-savvy audience. Now,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/louis%20vuitton"> Louis Vuitton</a> is jumping on the bandwagon by releasing a mobile video game to celebrate its founder&#39;s 200th birthday. <em>Louis: The Game </em>stars the fashion house&#39;s mascot Vivienne, a wooden doll embellished with the company&#39;s flower insignia, on a journey through the brand&#39;s history, reports Austrian newspaper <a href="https://kurier.at/freizeit/mode-beauty/louis-vuitton-handy-game-ios-iphone-android/401444422"><em>Kurier</em></a>.</p><p>The iOS and Android game reportedly tasks players with exploring a colorful world by completing various quests — all pretty generic so far. Whether it turns out to be more than just an unashamed bit of promotional fluff remains to be seen. The game drops on August 4th. If LV goes all-out psychedelic like it did with its recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/louis-vuitton-horizon-speaker-ufo-122944145.html">UFO-style speaker</a>, then it could be worth a look.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/louis-vuitton-200-bicentennial-celebration-1234889762/"><em>WWD</em></a>, the game will also feature &quot;embedded NFTs.&quot; Though, that hardly sounds promising.

Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/Peter_J_Beck/status/1420639713354928128">tweeted</a> shortly after the event that the payload was deployed and praised the team for a &quot;flawless&quot; launch.</p><div id="ac8390b9c91e45b5995cfe0a40606083"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEAKezzYi4Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Monolith&#39;s target location is in low-Earth orbit around 370 miles above our planet.

During the company&#39;s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said its next product release would be a pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things,&quot; the Facebook co-founder said. &quot;So I&#39;m excited to get those into people&#39;s hands and to continue to make progress on the journey toward full augmented reality glasses in the future.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook&#39;s sunglasses have been the subject of rumors since 2019. Back then, sources told <em>CNBC </em>that Facebook was working with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-orion-ar-glasses.html">AR eyewear nicknamed &quot;Orion.&quot;</a> The glasses were billed as a full-fledged phone replacement on which you could take calls, see information and even broadcast livestreams. That inevitably drew comparisons to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-google-glass-enterprise-edition-2.html">Google Glass</a> (another Luxottica collab) instead of the phone-tethered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-13-snap-spectacles-3.html">Spectacles</a> from Snap. Last year, Hugo Barra, then VP VR at Facebook Reality Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776">confirmed</a> that the glasses would land in 2021. But, we haven&#39;t heard much since.</p><p>For Facebook, the glasses hold the key to its future. Alongside virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) is integral to building the &quot;metaverse,&quot; Zuckerberg said. In the future, Facebook will morph into a shared, liveable platform that lets you &quot;teleport&quot; between different social experiences using VR and AR, Zuckerberg explained.&nbsp;</p><p>The term metaverse is the latest buzzword seized upon by Silicon Valley and futurists. While the concept has been around for well over a decade, it gained traction after the breakout success of multiplayer game creation platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-09-fornite-playground-cash-cow-minecraft.html"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-sony-in-game-music-153541190.html"><em>Roblox</em></a>. Earlier this week, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella mentioned an &quot;enterprise metaverse&quot; on his company&#39;s earnings call.</p><p>For Facebook, the metaverse is more than just a fad. The company is spending billions in order to build its shared universe, which will be populated with Facebook users and digital ads, according to Zuckerberg. In order for it to become a reality, the company needs more people to buy its computing hardware. Therefore, the plan is to make those devices more affordable.</p><p>&quot;Our business model isn&#39;t going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible,&quot; Zuckerberg noted. &quot;So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. So that&#39;s kind of at a high level how I&#39;m thinking about this.&quot;</p><p>Sunglasses aren&#39;t the only hardware Facebook is reportedly working on. Multiple reports have claimed Facebook is developing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-watch-rumor-222419888.html">smartwatch</a> with a built-in cellular connection and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html">detachable display</a>. Initially, it was believed that the watch would be first out the gate, but it seems Zuckerberg had other plans.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-100518155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d41ba0e7-6856-435d-bbb5-81f05c562d88</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 10:05:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627550110</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T09:15:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ede9f0f0-f04a-11eb-bfa6-96b85f7cf9b5" width="4176" height="2892" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ede9f0f0-f04a-11eb-bfa6-96b85f7cf9b5" width="4176" height="2892" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SUN VALLEY, ID - JULY 13: Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook, attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 13, 2018 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

The company has a number of wire-free models under its belt at this point, but there has been on glaring omission over the years: active noise cancellation (ANC). Today, B&amp;O remedied the issue with its new Beoplay EQ earbuds. The pricey audio accessory not only offers the ability to reduce ambient ruckus, but earbuds also feature solid battery life, wireless charging and more. The only potential deal breaker is the price: $399 (£349/€399).&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to flagship earbuds from the likes of Sony and others, Bang &amp; Olufsen&#39;s &quot;Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation&quot; setup on the Beoplay EQ is powered by a dedicated ANC chip. This means the Bluetooth chip isn&#39;t pulling double duty. That component combines with a set of four microphones to continuously monitor your surroundings and automatically adjust ANC levels as needed. That&#39;s the &quot;adaptive&quot; bit. Two additional microphones are equipped with &quot;retune noise reduction technology&quot; that B&amp;O says results in &quot;crystal clear&quot; calls. Mileage varies greatly on claims of voice quality when it comes to true wireless earbuds, so that description is definitely something that will need proper testing.

That case supports wireless charging and in true B&amp;O fashion, it&#39;s made out of aluminum. The company included a quick-charge feature that gives you two hours of listening time in 20 minutes. To help you find the best fit, there are four sizes of silicone tips and one pair of Comply foam tips in the box. Lastly, the Beoplay EQ is IP54 certified, so they should withstand dust and water splashes just fine. That&#39;s enough to keep the earbuds working through your sweaty workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The Beoplay EQ will be available in most of the world August 19th in black and gold color options.

That&#39;s despite the fact that its mobile division saw revenue fall over the previous quarter due to component shortages and COVID-related factory issues.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might expect given the current shortage, Samsung&#39;s chip business dominated its earnings this quarter, accounting for more than a third of total revenue and over half its profits.

It&#39;s also become one of the most controversial due to Rogan&#39;s choice of guests and his own views. Spotify doesn&#39;t have any plans to do anything about it, though, because the company&#39;s CEO doesn&#39;t believe the platform should have any say on podcasters&#39; content. When <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-talks-future-of-podcasts-93925d11-d002-478b-81fb-c371743f6c3c.html"><em>Axios</em></a> asked Spotify CEO Daniel Ek in an interview whether the company should have editorial responsibility over podcasts like Rogan&#39;s, Ek responded that Rogan is just one of its many content creators.</p><p><em>Axios</em> pointed out that Rogan may be just one of them, but he&#39;s also one of the most well-paid. Ek responded, however, that rappers earns tens of millions of dollars from the platform, but Spotify doesn&#39;t dictate what they can put in their songs either. Rogan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">signed</a> a $100 million deal with the audio streaming service in May 2020 to make <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> available to Spotify listeners.

Rogan has guested several polarizing figures on the show since its debut on the platform. They include Abigail Shrier, author of <em>Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters</em>, and <em>InfoWars</em> owner Alex Jones who spread coronavirus misinformation on the podcast. More recently, Rogan said he doesn&#39;t think people should get the COVID-19 vaccine, though he did backtrack and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/03/joe-rogan-told-his-millions-listeners-not-take-his-anti-vaccine-advice-seriously-is-it-too-late/">told listeners</a> not to take his advice seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>In Spotify&#39;s most recent earnings report, it said Rogan&#39;s podcast performed &quot;above expectations.&quot; Clearly, whatever he&#39;s doing is getting people to tune in, so the company probably doesn&#39;t see any reason to step in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ceo-editorial-responsibility-podcasts-040340113.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33577f4a-ab26-470f-8994-7c3ecaf2bfee</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 04:03:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627531447</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T04:04:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/b7356e10-9abd-11ea-bcbb-4693105109be" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/b7356e10-9abd-11ea-bcbb-4693105109be" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Syfy via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JOE ROGAN QUESTIONS EVERYTHING -- "Podcast" -- Pictured: Joe Rogan -- (Photo by: Vivian Zink/Syfy/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan Questions Everything - Season 1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will require its US office workforce to be vaccinated]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook will require that its workers get immunized against the coronavirus before they can return to its Menlo Park headquarters and other offices across the US. &quot;As our offices reopen, we will be requiring anyone coming to work at any of our US campuses to be vaccinated,&quot; Lori Goler, Facebook vice president of people, said on Wednesday. &quot;We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone&#39;s health and safety.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="60f4f40a62884d85b34e8ea5f80ed5bb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New statement from Lori Goler, Facebook VP, People: <a href="https://t.co/W2Ky0jolOu">pic.twitter.com/W2Ky0jolOu</a></p>— Dani Lever (@Dani_Lever) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dani_Lever/status/1420486108769619970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">Much like Google</a>, which announced a similar policy earlier in the day, the company said it would have a process in place for workers that can&#39;t get inoculated for medical and &quot;other&quot; reasons.

Speaking during the company’s second-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook.” And on Instagram, TikTok competitor Reels is the “largest contributor to engagement growth.”</p><p>Though he stopped short of sharing more specific stats, the new details suggest Instagram’s Reels may be gaining more traction as the company vies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">for creator talent</a>. Zuckerberg also noted that the company’s focus on creators and shopping would also help it reach its longer term goal of becoming a “metaverse company.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook revealed earlier this week that it was tapping an Instagram exec to start a new team focused on creating a metaverse. “You can kind of think about this as an embodied internet that you&#39;re inside of rather than just looking at,” Zuckerberg said. “You&#39;re basically gonna be able to do everything that you can on the internet today, as well as some things that don&#39;t make sense on the internet today like dancing.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s comments come as the company reported some of its strongest growth in years, with revenue of more than $29 billion, an increase of 56 percent from last year. The company also reported more than 3.5 billion “monthly active people,” though user growth in the US once again remained flat.</p><p>Despite the strong numbers this quarter, the company warned that the rest of 2021 could look very different. Facebook expects revenue and growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of the year, said CFO Dave Wehner. He also noted that Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which allows users to opt out of the social network’s ad tracking, would have a “greater impact” next quarter.<em></em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6199e11-9eba-4fcd-bbdf-94d270d59271</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 21:43:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627509814</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T22:03:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SUN VALLEY, IDAHO - JULY 08: CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks to lunch following a session at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 08, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Created by YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober, the Dominator is the result of more than five years of work. Rober had help from two freshmen from Stanford University and a Bay Area software engineer in creating the <a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot"><ins>googly-eyed robot</ins></a>. The group programmed more than 14,000 lines of code, and outfitted it with components like omnidirectional wheels and 3D-printed funnels to create what Rober says is a “friendly robot that’s super good at only one thing: setting up a butt-ton of dominos really, really fast.”</p><div id="01dc59faf64741ee9bbd306bd111e18d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HEfIJlcFbs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Up against professional domino artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smZYelKX18&amp;t=0s"><ins>Lily Hevesh</ins></a>, the Dominator used its ability to lay down 300 tiles all at once to work about 10 times faster than a human.

A series of conveyor belts ferry the dominions by color before the Kuka arm deposits them in the appropriate chute.

The company has hired law firm <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/en">WilmerHale</a> to review its policies, and Kotick says Activision Blizzard will implement changes to its hiring practices. It also plans to make personnel tweaks and remove content from its games employees and players have said is “inappropriate” in light of the allegations against the company. On Tuesday, the World of Warcraft development team said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wow-remove-inappropriate-references-california-lawsuit-035510730.html">remove specific references from the MMO</a>.

Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-requires-android-developers-to-disclose-privacy-data-173422000.html">announced</a> the upcoming feature that&#39;s similar to the Apple App Store&#39;s nutrition labels back in May. In a new post on the <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/">Android Developer blog</a>, though, Google has given us a glimpse of what that section may look like.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a listing, you will see a summary from the developer on what kind of data an app collects, so you can make a decision whether to install it or not. You&#39;ll also see safety details the developer chooses to highlight, such as whether an app encrypts your data, whether it&#39;s suitable for children and families and whether it&#39;s been independently validated against a global security standard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5917b2b0-ef8b-11eb-bcfa-5abd5aa4f796" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Google" data-uuid="928595c1-3b71-304b-8acb-01e1c985d041"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Further, you can tap the summary to see more details about the type of data an app collects and how it&#39;s used. It can show you whether an app collects location and contact data, personal information such as name and email address, as well as financial information. The section can also tell you whether the app uses your data for its features, for personalization or for other purposes. In addition, it can let you know whether you can opt out of getting your data collected or if giving an app access to your information really is necessary to be able to use it.</p><p>Google says the details might still change before the feature goes live, but all developers are required to provide a privacy policy for their apps and must provide accurate information for the safety section. Developers can start declaring privacy information in October and have until April 2022 to do so, but you&#39;ll start seeing the section pop up on Google Play sometime within the first quarter of next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-safety-section-play-android-apps-150052244.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a46d685-42b9-41f7-ac17-4065471a4882</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627468917</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T10:42:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47cd1c60-ef87-11eb-bd7b-9f467b83ba08" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47cd1c60-ef87-11eb-bd7b-9f467b83ba08" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests new shopping features for businesses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is the latest social media platform to experiment with new <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-shopping--testing-shoppable-profiles-on-twitter">shopping features</a>.

Sources tell the site that Tesla will instead focus on finding cheaper spaces, like parking lots and warehouses, that will house a remote fleet of cars. The company also won&#39;t be firing its retail staff (it&#39;s actually in the <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/22/tesla-tsla-salesforce-hiring-spree-demand-us/">middle of a hiring spree</a>).

This new strategy, if it ends up being implemented, seems to be a smarter implementation of that plan. Most Tesla customers already buy their cars online, so there&#39;s less of a need to have pricey mall stores around. The cheaper locations will also be better for holding more vehicles, which should help to satisfy increased demand for purchases and test drives.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-stores-high-end-malls-remote-fleets-142829801.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8a2a08d-8778-423a-a0b1-1fe0904c7703</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:28:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627482512</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T14:28:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9d249360-efae-11eb-9347-56aa82530c42" width="3500" height="2241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9d249360-efae-11eb-9347-56aa82530c42" width="3500" height="2241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hannibal Hanschke / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla car 'Model S' sits in a dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015.

Yes, that means what you think it does — Lollapalooza won&#39;t be streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-youtube-lollapalooza-2019-live-stream.html">on YouTube</a> like it has in recent years.</p><p>There&#39;s no extra charge, and you can watch if you <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:sign up for a free trial" href="https://fave.co/2QwdNTa">sign up for a free trial</a>. The Lollapalooza 2021 lineup includes plenty of big names, including Illenium (July 29th), Tyler, the Creator (July 30th), Post Malone (July 31st) and Foo Fighters (August 1st).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hulu has streamed concerts before, including a Black History Month show in February and a <em>Summer of Soul</em> tribute on Juneteenth. However, this is the service&#39;s first exclusive live event. It&#39;s a big bet that livestreams like this can translate to more customers, not to mention draw attention away from free services like YouTube.</p><p>Whether or not music fans follow is another matter. YouTube is still a go-to destination for live festivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-livestream-coachella-2022-063025456.html">like Coachella</a>, and that may be what virtual concertgoers are expecting. There&#39;s a real possibility that many would-be viewers will just skip Lollapalooza altogether rather than sign up for Hulu, no matter how easily they can cancel service afterward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lollapalooza-2021-live-stream-hulu-140043962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dd38225c-7c6b-4ef0-ad5e-ae8e4e23e15e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627481440</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T14:10:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2002ca10-efa8-11eb-9d43-e80c882c0e9b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2002ca10-efa8-11eb-9d43-e80c882c0e9b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gabriella Angotti-Jones / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyler, the Creator performs during Governors Ball Music Festival at Randall's Island Park in New York, U.S. May 31, 2019.

An update rolling out today adds a new “Places” section to the map, with educated sections for recommendations, locations you’ve visited and “favorites” to remember.</p><p>The idea is similar to Foursquare (the original check-in based iteration), except “checking in” in this case consists of tagging a specific location in a Snap. Places you’ve tagged are automatically saved in your “visited” tab, but you can also manually add establishments to your “favorites” list. Interestingly, Snap is also using the new feature to generate recommendations. The “popular” section of the map will surface a list of personalized suggestions based on places you’ve been and what’s popular in your area.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though the Snap Map has been around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-21-snapchat-snap-map.html"><ins>for years</ins></a> the company has been working to make it more useful — and more visible — within the app. The company gave the feature more prominent placement in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-app-redesign-action-bar-171555996.html"><ins>a redesign</ins></a> last year, and plans to add <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-partnerships-and-tools-for-developers-to-build-with-snapchat"><ins>Map Layers</ins></a>, a feature that allows third-parties like Ticketmaster to incorporate events and other content directly into the map.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-snap-map-places-140030542.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33f80887-7fb0-4aa2-8353-b20cdf4177ae</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627434048</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T01:01:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fe657e80-ef3d-11eb-b75b-988161094e05" width="1788" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fe657e80-ef3d-11eb-b75b-988161094e05" width="1788" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat's map can now track where you've been and serve up recommendations.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snap map places]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
