    <title>Floyd Mayweather is fighting Logan Paul in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WriFZ7F05tFYEpCNYIYpt_lTHqA=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68468465/paulmayweather.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6HY5q"&gt;YouTuber Logan Paul has struck a deal to fight former boxing megastar Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a “special exhibition” match on February 20th. The bout will be streamed as a &lt;a href="https://fanmio.com/products/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-special-exhibition-fight"&gt;pay-per-view on Fanmio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljDODc"&gt;Mayweather is an undefeated champion with a 50-0 record, multiple world titles in five weight classes, and an Olympic bronze medal. Paul is best known for his controversial YouTube video where he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16875188/logan-paul-aokigahara-suicide-forest-japan"&gt;filmed a dead body in a Japanese forest&lt;/a&gt;. He has fought in one sanctioned boxing match: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785762/logan-paul-ksi-fight-winner-result-youtube"&gt;a loss to fellow YouTuber KSI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PlkG7"&gt;Needless to say, this is unlikely to be a festival of evenly matched athletic prowess. But Mayweather is not above signing up to exhibitions for the spectacle and the payday. His 50th official win involved him coming out of retirement in 2017 to face UFC star Conor McGregor, who had never professionally boxed before. The following year he fought kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in a widely panned exhibition match, winning by TKO in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eFPcV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We talked to Jake Paul, who is currently going Super Saiyan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SAMpSQ"&gt;Mayweather called out Logan Paul last month &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FloydMayweather/status/1329295858521706497"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, making his thoughts on boxing YouTubers clear and saying he’s “not the one for the kid games.” Paul’s brother, Jake, responded to Mayweather’s comments ahead of his own match against former NBA player Nate Robinson, which he ended up winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAijp"&gt;“You know, it doesn’t bother me,” Jake &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day, he’s like 5-foot-4, so he’s actually the little kid here, and obviously he just wants attention. He’s fifty-something years old. He should be in retirement. So he just wants to get relevancy by talking about the YouTube kids, because we’re the ones popping off right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0BDQg"&gt;(Mayweather is actually 5-foot-8 and 43 years old. Also very good at boxing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa42Qr"&gt;The whole situation is deeply silly, which is no doubt why organizers expect a lot of people to tune in. The “early pricing” of $24.99 only applies to the first million PPV sales, with the price rising to $39.99, then $59.99 on December 29th, then $69.99 from February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube hit Ryan’s World comes to Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o-TIL6yT9KuOTY16yT3Q598gZE=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455644/RW_Roblox_Characters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9xEIc"&gt;Ryan’s World is expanding to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. The hit YouTube channel is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F4882738396%2FRyans-World-Launch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F4%2F22152447%2Fryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching its own virtual world&lt;/a&gt; inside the popular kids game, which allows players to create their own spaces and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrjFWS"&gt;Players will be able to drop into a sprawling digital world inspired by the YouTube show and explore a racecourse, a fire station, a beach, and a school, among other locations. There’s also a Rainbow Road-esque path into space and a strange box labeled “MYSTERY PETS.” The game world is supposed to launch on December 5th at 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAv8F8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been around for more than a decade, but the game’s popularity has soared since the beginning of the pandemic. It now has 31.1 million daily users, up 82 percent year over year, and the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;filed to go public&lt;/a&gt;. As it’s grown, more and more mainstream names have carved out a space inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to meet its huge audience. Lil Nas X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557275/lil-nas-x-roblox-virtual-performance-announced-holiday-old-town-road"&gt;performed a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; there in November, and the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594054/ready-player-two-roblox-treasure-hunt-ernest-cline"&gt;hosted a treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; to tie in with the release of &lt;em&gt;Ready Player Two &lt;/em&gt;earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKoq3BjCUamLCvz6ASW7R5ycuhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22144602/RTR_MKT_RobloxStil_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AyknTu"&gt;Ryan’s World has likewise been growing. The YouTube channel, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;started with toy unboxing videos&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, has grown into a multimedia kids empire. The channel’s star, Ryan Kaji, has a TV show on Nick Jr., a racing video game available on major consoles, and a toy and clothing line sold at major retailers. The channel just made plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;a new show on Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPGX7a"&gt;Kaji has been regularly playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; on one of his YouTube channels for more than two years, so offering a Ryan’s World level that viewers can later visit seems like a natural expansion. Though &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is free to play, it also offers creators a way to make money by selling items inside their game worlds. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/9-year-old-youtube-star-ryan-kaji-opens-virtual-world-on-roblox-11607079600"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Ryan’s World location will sell gems that can be exchanged for virtual goods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will ask commenters to rethink posting if their message seems offensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JKI8adtg2Ztzwsbgcg8jXS37J4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449820/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBFLa3"&gt;YouTube is trying to combat offensive comments that appear under videos by following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286855/twitter-articles-prompt-unread-feature-conversations"&gt;other social media companies&lt;/a&gt; and asking people before they post something that may be offensive: “Is this something you really want to share?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s15mkm"&gt;The company is launching a new product feature that will warn people when they’re going to post a comment that it “may be offensive to others,” in order to give them “the option to reflect before posting,” according to a new blog post. The tool won’t actually stop people from posting said comment. Prompts won’t appear before every comment, but it will for ones that YouTube’s system deems offensive, which is based on content that’s been repeatedly reported. Once the prompt does appear, people can post the comment as they originally intended or use additional time to edit the comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeEwr"&gt;For creators, the company is also rolling out better content filtering systems in YouTube Studio (the backend where creators manage their channel). The new filter will seek out inappropriate or hurtful comments that were automatically flagged and held for review, and remove them from the queue so people don’t have to read them. The new feature will roll out on Android first and in English before appearing elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPSdLv"&gt;There’s no question that YouTube has a problem with hurtful comments on the site, but one of the bigger issues is hateful comments. Through automatic filtering, the company has removed over 46 times more daily hate speech comments since early 2019 than ever before, according to YouTube. Then there’s videos. YouTube claims that of the 1.8 million channels terminated last quarter, more than 54,000 were due to hate speech. Those were the most bans for hate speech content in a single quarter that YouTube has seen, and three times as high than in early 2019 when new hate speech policies went into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBwRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hateful speech and hurtful comments are just some of the problems that greatly affect the creator community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVck9F"&gt;YouTube is also trying to combat other issues affecting creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449717/youtube-age-restriction-machine-learning-rollout-kids-content-monetization-creators"&gt;monetization&lt;/a&gt;, bias, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17879652/youtube-creator-youtuber-burnout-problem"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, and channel growth concerns. To better understand how different communities are impacted, the company will start to ask YouTubers to voluntarily supply information about their gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity beginning in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks4zXc"&gt;The goal is to use the data to pinpoint how different communities are treated both in terms of discovery on the platform and when it comes to monetization. The LGBTQ creator community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21278050/youtube-lawsuit-lgbtq-google-doj-section-230-trump-executive-order"&gt;has consistently said&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube’s systems automatically demonetize their content or hide their videos, and they have publicly fought against the treatment they receive. YouTube’s teams also want to use the data to find “possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsVu1T"&gt;One of the biggest questions is how that data will be used and stored once it’s collected. YouTube’s blog post states that the survey will outline how the information will be applied to the company’s research and what control creators retain over their data. The blog post as it stands does not specify that now. Instead, the company states that information will not be used for advertising purposes. People will also retain the ability to opt out and delete their information whenever they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aa6jQV"&gt;“If we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities, we’re committed to working to fix them,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7xTav"&gt;There’s no current timeline for when the surveys will roll out, but more information about the project will be released in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube expands its Premieres feature with trailers and live redirects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQTbnooQ0rE3Xlp6qpSa1m2GFxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68378905/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6tdQkA"&gt;YouTube is building on its Premieres feature — used for live-streaming pre-recorded videos — by adding support for trailers, redirects from live pre-shows, and customized countdown timers. The company says there’s been an 85 percent growth in the daily use of the feature from over 8 million channels, and these additions might make Premieres useful in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubReQK"&gt;Premieres was designed to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490456/youtube-pre-recorded-videos-livestream-vidcon-2018"&gt;some of the benefits of YouTube live streams&lt;/a&gt; like live chat, but with the control of a pre-recorded and edited video. Creators typically use it to watch and respond to their subscribers while new videos debut. But as the pandemic has pushed film festivals and conventions online, Premieres’ use cases have grown. These new changes attempt to build on that momentum as online events become the norm by catering to some of the structure and marketing of traditional live events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MKQY6jpgUYBT3lBm6nmGr9nc04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137126/YTblog_BTSRedCarpet_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s simulated example of a live redirect from a BTS pre-show to a music video premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z0AGmC"&gt;The first of the new features is Live Redirect, which allows a creator with a premiere to hold a live stream prior to the video going live and automatically redirect viewers to it once it starts. YouTube imagines this filling the role of a pre-show or red carpet so viewers can learn and get excited about an upcoming video immediately before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIco6cU1ck0oXELaP7UqNSqXQ8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137138/YTblog_SetReminder_ClashRoyale_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a trailer advertising a premiere on its watch page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3mpOzS"&gt;The new optional Trailers are designed to fill in another pre-Premieres space, this time by looping a 15-second to three-minute video on an upcoming premiere’s watch page. Trailers could be used to advertise an upcoming premiere and entice potential viewers to set a reminder to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esSVKL7PDsawMfFPXinDvXpTAiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137140/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of countdown timer themes that creators will be able to choose from to lead into their premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wC7D51"&gt;The final new addition is the ability to customize the countdown timer that plays before a premiere with a Countdown Theme. YouTube says creators will be able to choose from a variety of “themes, vibes, and moods” so that the timer better matches the content of the video, rather than YouTube’s default style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oodeCd"&gt;YouTube says Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators today, with Countdown Themes available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galactus event was Fortnite’s biggest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSZCjWQ04D7svm6bi0OxP_35zbo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68247701/Fortnite_20201201161314.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7whbvu"&gt;The season-ending live event that just took place in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was the game’s biggest to date, Epic Games has confirmed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;The Galactus event&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current Marvel-themed season, had a record 15.3 million concurrent players, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1333954587879821314"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPGpzH"&gt;That beats out the Travis Scott concert from April, which peaked at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;12.3 million concurrents during the first showing&lt;/a&gt;. The record before that was the Marshmello show, which reached 10.7 million. Epic says that 3.4 million people also watched the Galactus event on Twitch and YouTube. The event saw players teaming up to stop the Marvel supervillain from destroying &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island by piloting an explosives-laden battle bus to feed him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="atwHpA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s Galactus event was a giant arcade shooter — and now the game is down","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JlJxIr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently shut down as Epic prepares to launch season 5. Anyone booting the game right now will see a timer counting down until the next season — it’s currently set at just under six hours to go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s top trending video of 2020 is a powerful Dave Chappelle Netflix special</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkyEP9uEn8Z6KTNw-rtCAq44lPs=/93x0:2468x1583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042570/chappelle.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3Ysm3"&gt;YouTube has released its annual top trending videos list of 2020, and the list reflects a year dominated by shifts in behavior brought on by the pandemic, civil unrest, and a heated political environment leading up to the US election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1toBsk"&gt;The top trending video of 2020 was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fon-television%2Fdave-chappelles-rough-cut-humorlessness-in-846&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21755000%2Fyoutube-top-trending-videos-2020-dave-chappelle-netflix#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dave Chappelle’s &lt;em&gt;8:46&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 27-minute stand-up special that was filmed at a socially distanced event in Ohio where the comedian lives. Netflix dropped the surprise special on June 12th, amid ongoing protests dedicated to fighting racism and police brutality around the world in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355121/new-civil-rights-movement-police-brutality-protests-film-videos-black-lives-matter"&gt;wake of George Floyd’s death&lt;/a&gt;. The special was praised by critics and other public figures for its honesty about America’s ongoing issues with racism. The title of the special, &lt;em&gt;8:46&lt;/em&gt;, references the length of time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21378157/police-brutality-violence-recording-videos-black-lives-matter-consequences"&gt;pressed on Floyd’s neck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kje140"&gt;“More than anything else, it sets the tone for how there was this thing that was happening in culture and in the world, and how people created content that reflected this moment that was happening,” Earnest Pettie, an analyst on YouTube’s culture and trends team, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Viewers swarmed to it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOPOSb"&gt;That’s true with other videos found on the list as well. The second top trending video of the year is &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/10/watch-saturday-night-live-cold-open-starring-jim-carrey.html"&gt;first debate cold open&lt;/a&gt; that focused on the presidential election. The open featured Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump and Jim Carrey as President-elect Joe Biden. Despite the video only being published on YouTube in early October, it quickly became one of the most shared videos, according to Pettie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s4Xt8q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Top Trending list is an accurate reflection of what people are actually into, and talking about and sharing with each other.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIzz2F"&gt;Elsewhere, signs of what was happening in other parts of 2020 culture can be found on the list, too. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21571189/charli-damelio-100-million-tiktok-followers"&gt;Charli and Dixie D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, two of TikTok’s most popular creators, made the top 10 list for breakout stars on YouTube. Also on the list is Chloe Ting, an exercise influencer who became extremely popular at the &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a33635518/chloe-ting-teenage-girls-and-the-quest-for-flat-abs-in-lockdown/"&gt;beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the United States when people were trying to find ways to work out at home. Corpse Husband, a YouTuber who &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/corpse-husband-face-reveal-aoc-real-name-look-like-youtuber-2020-11"&gt;picked up quite a bit of attention&lt;/a&gt; after one of his songs went viral on TikTok and he streamed &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;with some fellow big-name YouTube creators and public figures (AOC, Toast, James Charles), also made the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPQBvg"&gt;Some of the names are also recognizable to people keeping up with the YouTube community. MrBeast, Jeffree Star, NikkieTutorials, Dude Perfect, and David Dobrik all created some of the year’s top trending videos. What remains unclear from this year’s list is how many people watched those videos — just because a video is counted as a top trending title doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the most watched. YouTube’s team wanted to focus on “a variety of ways that people interact” with what they’re watching, Pettie said. Unlike former years, YouTube also doesn’t have any plans to release a Most Viewed list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSpOBW"&gt;“The Top Trending list is an accurate reflection of what people are actually into, and talking about and sharing with each other,” Pettie said. “This is what we feel is an excellent representation of the year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdBQld"&gt;The full list of Top Trending 2020 titles can be read below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We talked to Jake Paul, who is currently going Super Saiyan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jake Paul v AnEsonGib" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Y0PtJeuh0ocdSp-ddDoxH2AjM0=/0x0:3469x2313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67990254/1203118968.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At 6 billion views and just as many controversies, the YouTube superstar says he’s a “realistic role model”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QD57TE"&gt;Jake Paul feels misunderstood. The YouTube sensation / likely FBI target / former Disney Channel star is frustrated that people don’t see the real him — just the pieces of him that are always screwing up. Yes, he may be known for outlandish YouTube prank videos, he may have been &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-21/calabasas-mayor-calls-out-youtuber-jake-paul-for-house-party-sets-new-restrictions"&gt;criticized by his city’s mayor&lt;/a&gt; for throwing a huge party during the pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;later had his home raided by the FBI&lt;/a&gt; in connection with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;a supposed “riot” at a mall&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s also trying to do some good things, he says, like inspire his millions of young fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aW9si1"&gt;“People forget that I’m human, and that I’m 23 years old. And that I’m just a normal fucking kid that got handed a lot of power and responsibility, and it’s easy to mess up with that a lot,” Paul told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on a Zoom call from the bedroom of his Calabasas mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MoN13"&gt;In recent videos, Paul has said he wants to put YouTube behind him. He wants to be a rapper and a boxer now — two professions that fall just a notch behind YouTuber in terms of the drama they generate — and it’s really been the YouTube mindset that’s caused so many of his problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QUxVEV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s my mindset right now, just going Super Saiyan and not letting anyone defeat me ever.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dBywVk"&gt;“When you wake up with the mindset of like, ‘I have to top myself today, and I have to get more views than I did yesterday, and I only have 12 hours of daylight to make something happen. What are we gonna do?’” Paul said, “That’s, that’s where the issues come in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eanJn9"&gt;And yet: as Paul has gone on a press blitz this week to hype up his &lt;a href="https://tysonontriller.com/fight-card/"&gt;forthcoming pay-per-view boxing match&lt;/a&gt; against former NBA player Nate Robinson, he’s done a typically poor job of avoiding controversy. On Wednesday, the headline “Jake Paul Believes COVID Is ‘a Hoax’ and ‘98% of News Is Fake’” was &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s against this backdrop that he gets on a call with me later that day to talk about his boxing match, his music career, and of course, how he always manages to stir up controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZFYke"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zl0Bel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we jump into things, I want to ask right at the top: your avatar on YouTube and Twitter. Why Gohan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luSgH1"&gt;Man. Gohan. Super Saiyan 3. That’s my mindset right now, just going Super Saiyan and not letting anyone defeat me ever. I have Gohan tattooed on my leg and Vegeta as well. It’s like my fight mindset. I’m going Super Saiyan on Saturday. Nate’s not going to be able to do anything to stop me, and I’m going to be in ultimate form. I’ve worked so hard to be in the tip-top shape, and that’s sort of the meaning of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYw1hN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So tell me about the boxing match. I know you’ve been prepping for this for months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPNINx"&gt;This Saturday me and Nate are fighting at 189 pounds. It’s a professionally sanctioned six round bout, 10 ounce gloves, no headgear. Nate started talking to shit, saying, “Jake you never fought a professional athlete, you never fought anyone good.” I was like, “Alright, well then, I’ll fight you.” So he was the one that asked for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ove4W7"&gt;For me, it’s a perfect fight because everyone thinks I’m just this YouTube pretty kid. And everyone thinks that he’s this buff NBA athlete. But on Saturday, people are gonna see how serious I’m taking the sport and how good I am at the sport. And I plan on knocking out him in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9ib7B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your matches so far have been against people who aren’t known as boxers. Do you want to get in the ring with people who are pro boxers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzE4qN"&gt;I want to. I want to bring MMA fighters from the UFC over into the ring and go head to head with them. I want to prove myself, and prove how good I am at this sport. In sparring, I’m fighting pro boxers all the time. WBA champs, WBC champs. And I’m going head to head with them. So, you know, these YouTubers and celebrities and all these people can get the smoke first, and then it’s on to professional fighters for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUS25p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious what YouTube’s role is in your career right now. You still vlog regularly. But you’ve been saying that you want to be a rapper and a boxer and that you’re not a YouTuber anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyUc3F"&gt;That stems from what my focus is. I wake up every day and I box, and that’s been what I’ve done for the past year. And while I was doing that, I was in the studio a lot making songs. YouTube will always be something that I do, and it’s something that I’m good at and I like it. My fans are obviously there. But I don’t want to wake up with that same YouTube mentality and mindset of like, “views, views, views, pranks, pranks, pranks.” It’s not something I’m as passionate about anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4nBTsx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_xNx_-nqio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JLdwWB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was watching one of your videos from maybe a month ago, and you said, “YouTube has a cap, you can only get so big being a YouTuber. With music, there’s no cap, you can go as high as you possibly want to take it.” Where do you want to take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiNUBq"&gt;Ah, man. I want to be selling out stadiums. And having the crazy lit tours and platinum singles and platinum albums. And I want to collaborate with some of the biggest artists in the world and just make music that really inspires a generation. I want to be able to inspire the generation beneath me with music like Drake did, like Lil Wayne did to me growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5jRIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel like I’m a very relatable person with what I’ve gone through in my life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vuuSP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say inspire, what do you want people’s takeaway to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMRTs1"&gt;I think life throws people so many challenges and tribulations and hard times. And I feel like I’m a very relatable person with what I’ve gone through in my life from being in Ohio, to success, and everything along that path, and relationships and fallouts and drama and feuds with my parents and feuds with my family. I just feel like I have a lot to say and to be able to teach people about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfWT7P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fight is being broadcast on Triller. You’re an investor in Triller, right? Why did you invest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aT9rS"&gt;Yeah. Their team, first and foremost, is great. When I go to make investments, I like to invest in people, because ideas change. And this space we live in is so fast and rapid. And one minute a company could be so successful and the next minute, it could literally be worth nothing. I believe in people, in leadership, and I think that’s the main reason I invested in Triller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFic6l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t really use Triller as an app. You even did a video about TikTok creators and pivoting to TikTok. So why aren’t you using Triller?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeYLtO"&gt;I’m so busy with other shit that like the least of my worries is— I barely even post on Twitter. I think I have like, probably 20 tweets in like a month. And that’s something that’s super easy to do. And I don’t like to post content unless it’s like super high quality or something that I’m proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2e8NCt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get the most expensive lawyers, they cost Ms.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YKKvje"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a new song and his music video out this week. How’s the response been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1ao4X"&gt;It’s been amazing. I’ve been reading the comments and people are blown away. They’re just like, “Jake keeps on getting better at music. You can try to hate on this kid, but he’s dropping fire. This is undeniably good.” People are loving the lines in there, the lyricism. I’m huge on lyricism. So the response has been fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAXR64"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a line in the song I wanted to ask you about. I think one of the lyrics says you avoided a gun charge and it cost you a million. Can you tell me what happened here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXmC68"&gt;[Laughing] I can’t. I can’t talk too much about it. But um, yeah, when you get the most expensive lawyers, they cost Ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kVmp2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have to clear that line with your lawyers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uAnNk"&gt;I probably should have, honestly, but I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIkS6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I have to ask about Arizona [where you were filmed inside a mall during what police later called a “riot”]. You said you were filming to share your experience and document the scene. Do you plan to release that footage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbfR0h"&gt;I released parts of it already. On YouTube, in sort of an explanation video that I made like with how that situation unfolded. Um, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoW47X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe I missed it. I know there was a brief little thing where you spoke about it, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/08/12/jake-paul-fbi-raid-arizona-looting-dog-walk-tana-mongeau-ex-girlfriend/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; caught it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and then it disappeared.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv0nln"&gt;I think it’s still on my channel. Pretty sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2lz9r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, I’ll have to check then. [Note: I checked later and could not find the footage.] Have you talked to the FBI at all since the raid happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdUCTb"&gt;I have not personally, no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cCkLpz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you worried at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbJz83"&gt;You know, I think with those type of situations, it just is what it is. I’m not even sure. I have as little answers as everyone else. Everything that the media knows is what I know. So, you know, I’m not allowed to talk too much about it. But it’s being handled, and it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPwpPn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, so you really don’t know what they’re looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAQNYK"&gt;I’m not allowed to talk that much about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8B7Mf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You tweeted in July that one of your goals is to “show people who the real ‘Jake Paul’ is not what they see in media.” So what side of you do you want people to see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVEVNT"&gt;I think people forget that I’m human, and that I’m 23 years old. And that I’m just a normal fucking kid that got handed a lot of power and responsibility, and it’s easy to mess up with that a lot. It truly is. And I’m not making excuses for myself at all. But I’m just a genuine guy. if I was at a local frat party, and I met anyone — guy, girl, whoever it is — I’m the type of person that gets along with anyone and is super down to earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dkPvm1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I look at myself as like a realistic role model.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ShGZ9Y"&gt;Because of the mistakes I’ve made, the target on my back grows and grows and grows. And it becomes easier to be like, “Ah yeah, it’s that fucking guy again.” When people meet me in person, it’s different. Maybe I’m not good at translating through the camera and through interviews who I am. I think that’s also one of my issues. It’s hard for me for people to understand me based off of an interview or based off of a YouTube video. And I think people like to highlight the negative anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPdW8S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think media coverage of you should look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxrJsQ"&gt;I think that what the media covers now is fair. I completely get it. You know, if I was the media, I would cover the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBy7Bk"&gt;I think a lot of times the media doesn’t talk about why I’m at where I’m at and why I’m successful. And I think there’s just a little bit of a lack of respect. It’s more so everything negative versus like, “Hey, this was the number one requested Make-A-Wish kid for three years. He granted every single Make-A-Wish. He has 20 million subscribers, and a lot of those subscribers are young kids and he inspires them with his saying, ‘It’s everyday bro.’ To wake up every day, smile every day, to work hard and chase their dreams every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu6vLs"&gt;They don’t like to highlight any of the positive things that I’m doing. It’s usually just like “party, FBI, raid, fight, Gigi Hadid, news van, fire.” You know what I’m saying? But I understand it. I’m not complaining. I just wish there was a little bit more respect, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5c2hrh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You told another reporter [Marlow Stern with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;] that you raised $1 million for kids. Can you tell me more about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BayqjN"&gt;Um, I don’t know. I don’t know what reporter I told that to. I didn’t raise $1 million for kids. I’ve raised over $1 million for different foundations and through different causes. Not solely for one cause or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bCZuV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any in particular?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69rJVM"&gt;The biggest one was when I went down to Houston for the hurricanes. I was down there helping, and we raised over a quarter million dollars just in two days for families down there. That was probably the biggest one in a sole period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CcYdyM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Should we be telling kids, ‘Hey, never play with fire? Hey, never throw a party. You’re not allowed to drink alcohol.’ You know what I’m saying?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8LjPIG"&gt;I’m 23, you know, and I want to be able to continue to do good. I haven’t accomplished all my goals from a philanthropy side of things. I know there’s more good I can do. Every Thanksgiving, I go down to Skid Row and hand out meals and pizzas. I’ve tried to get involved in as hands-on a way as possible. But I definitely want to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77ybmO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going back to your answer before this about inspiring kids, how do you square that with the fact that you also end up getting known for the parties and the fires and these bad headlines? Do you feel any responsibility there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raxuMh"&gt;Um, no. I think those things are, like, taken out of context. Right. I’m not some perfect role model. But I don’t think anyone’s perfect, so everyone’s gonna have their flaws and every role model’s gonna have some mess ups. But like, should we be telling kids, “Hey, never play with fire? Hey, never throw a party. You’re not allowed to drink alcohol.” You know what I’m saying? So, I look at myself as like a realistic role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aIjshA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLEDRiPD63g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gG2HWj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about being known as this controversial person? I saw in a video recently, you called yourself, “the most controversial fucking idiot in the world.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUHncW"&gt;I don’t mind it, you know? I think before it would bother me. Because I just felt misunderstood. And I still feel misunderstood. But now it’s like, you know, I’m just gonna be myself and be me. And that’s what makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7juYUc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you aim to be controversial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRDzII"&gt;No. No, I just think, naturally, I’m polarizing as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZRojgE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Generating headlines for attention is different than purposely being controversial.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uRF6EQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask because you dropped a music video today, you’ve got this big PPV event Saturday, and you’re going out and doing these interviews. Are you considering generating headlines to drive attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6kGh"&gt;Yeah, I mean, okay, that’s a different question. You know, generating headlines for attention is different than purposely being controversial. I think any smart marketer — which is what I am at the end of the day, which is how I’ve gotten all my successes — is gonna create viral marketing things and ideas. Especially when it comes to around the time when I have something that I want people to tune into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOeHMj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there’s a headline this week, “Jake Paul calls COVID a hoax.” Is that part of your marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBJN92"&gt;No. So this guy, this reporter, he misquoted me. He took what I said out of context, and I told him that. I told him that the whole entire time. It was probably the worst interview I’ve ever done. He was just like leading me down certain paths with his questions. And it’s quite upsetting actually that someone with that sort of power can just publish something that’s false. And then just everyone would conceive it to be true when reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's the audio of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JakePaul&lt;/a&gt; telling me COVID is "a hoax," that America should open back up, and comparing it to the flu: &lt;a href="https://t.co/bqQKvQrUjs"&gt;https://t.co/bqQKvQrUjs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/1332457428361895937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBXsDF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was false about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iknns3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; [Note: While Paul says &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; misquoted him, it is based on a transcription — just like this interview. After we published this story, the interviewer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/1332457428361895937"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;released an audio recording&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; of Paul’s statements where you can clearly hear Paul suggesting the disease is a hoax.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9yhz1"&gt;Um, I haven’t read the whole article. But the whole entire time, I would say something, and he would be like, ‘so what you’re trying to say is’ and then say a sentence. And then I would be like ‘No, that’s not what I’m trying to say.’ I’ve done like fucking 20 interviews in the past fucking 24 hours. Again, it goes back to what I was saying earlier on the call, like, I’m a human. If I say one sentence and people want to take that out of context, that’s exactly my point. I’m not going to be perfect. But that guy was a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciwEvO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you stand by the idea that COVID is a hoax?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIMtRb"&gt;No, no. COVID is very, very real. COVID is very real, like, it’s killed so many people. It’s killed people I know. It’s killed someone very, very close to me. So that’s what I’m saying. I don’t even know where that came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J1h3cj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That wasn’t one of my marketing ideas at all. So I have no idea.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tc7MT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going back to your earlier answer, where is the line between the controversies and the viral marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRZH72"&gt;Yeah, it’s interesting. It’s a fine line. I think that question remains unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LbUfh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does a headline like that, about COVID, drive ticket sales for pay per view?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTDKmI"&gt;I’m not sure. I’m not sure. And that wasn’t one of my marketing ideas at all. So I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c108Av"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In another video recently, you said, “Getting YouTube views. That’s where the slip ups come from.” And obviously, this isn’t YouTube, this is his boxing. But I’m curious, why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7QdCX"&gt;I think when you wake up every single day as a YouTuber — this is what I did in my past — when you wake up with the mindset of like, “I have to top myself today, and I have to get more views than I did yesterday, and I only have 12 hours of daylight to make something happen. What are we gonna do?” That’s, that’s where the issues come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRaIsn"&gt;Are you gonna make something that’s entertaining that people want to watch, or are you going to make some boring shit? You know, it’s entertainment. People like to be entertained. And if they’re not, they’re not going to fuck with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Pveh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent have you found that the controversies drive views and further popularity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5kPgA"&gt;I think drama more so than that. Good news travels fast, bad news travels faster. You know, no one’s like, “Hey, did you see Justin Bieber donated $1 million today?” No one’s saying that. They’re saying, “Did you see Justin Bieber ran over a paparazzi today?” You know what I’m saying? No one cares about the good shit. Be honest. We live in a toxic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1sC1M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems to me so much of your brand is built around that, though. You say that controversies seem to bother you a little bit, but is there a way for you to maintain what you’re doing without generating those kind of bad headlines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jXxNM"&gt;Controversies don’t bother me. It’s more so being misunderstood. Because that’s never a good feeling. It’d be like looking in a mirror and like I see myself, but if you were standing next to me in the mirror, you would see someone else. So I don’t know if that answers the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6p8Oy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should the controversies be understood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1rVFr"&gt;I don’t think they’re meant to be understood. Like, I don’t think even I understand them all. You know what I’m saying? Put it like this. I’ve been living under a microscope since I was 17 years old. And I’m 23 with a lot of power, responsibility, everything. If every single day, or everywhere you went, from the time the normal human was 17 to 23, what would people see, hear, or film you doing that would make you look like shit and that the world would hate you for if they found out about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pVO5i1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would say the only thing that’s not going well is people seeing who I am.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35Pf8l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like you have control over some of that stuff, though?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjYEn4"&gt;I’m not saying — 100 percent, I’m not. But I guess that goes back to like, I take responsibility for my actions, and I’ve learned a lot from making mistakes and doing things that I disagree with, and that I can learn from, for sure. That’s part of the process is just getting better as I get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3G7mg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me just ask one more thing, going back to that tweet about your goals from earlier this year. You said “gimme 36 months,” you’re going to reach your goal of being a top fighter, a top rapper, showing your real self, helping your friends. It’s only been four months, but how’s that going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CX60V3"&gt;I would say it’s going good. I guess I would base things off of actual facts and evidence and numbers, the pay-per-view is on pace to be one of the biggest, and my music, the views on it are doing phenomenal, in my opinion. I’m helping my friends who live here with their music careers. I’m helping them push their businesses. And we’re creating great memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWK1zE"&gt;I would say the only thing that’s not going well is people seeing who I am. [Laughing] But it’s a work in progress. I don’t think people like a story that’s perfect, so I think that’s what I have going for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu29KI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added an embedded audio recording of Paul’s suggestion to The Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern that COVID-19 is a hoax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube suspends One America News for one week after it promoted a fake COVID-19 cure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xE6W_owH8YECJHpskmTQSICxfNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67939894/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qMvtV"&gt;YouTube has temporarily suspended right-wing outlet One America News Network (OANN) for promoting a false COVID-19 cure. OANN’s channel will stay online, but it will be prevented from uploading new videos for a week, and it’s been removed from YouTube’s advertising partner program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3o6GzO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-temporarily-suspends-demonetizes-oann-420e8ea9-66c1-4eab-9754-6e3b708483c9.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_content=1100"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported the news today&lt;/a&gt;, and YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi confirmed it to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “After careful review, we removed a video from &lt;em&gt;OANN&lt;/em&gt; and issued a strike on the channel for violating our COVID-19 misinformation policy, which prohibits content claiming there’s a guaranteed cure,” Choi says. “Additionally, due to repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy and other channel monetization policies, we’ve suspended the channel from the YouTube Partner Program and as a result, its monetization on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOAIhv"&gt;OANN has repeatedly tested YouTube’s policies, most recently around the US presidential election. YouTube took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551790/youtube-election-misinformation-oann-live-stream-mail-in-vote-count-ballot"&gt;more hands-off approach&lt;/a&gt; to election misinformation than Facebook and Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;allowing a video&lt;/a&gt; where OANN falsely claimed President Donald Trump won the election. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;defended its policy&lt;/a&gt; by emphasizing that it promotes “authoritative news organizations,” a category that YouTube says doesn’t include OANN. After its COVID-19 video, OANN will have to reapply for the partner program if it wants to monetize videos, and it will receive one strike under YouTube’s three-strikes policy for termination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests whether you’ll ever get sick of Bad Guy with an endless Billie Eilish mashup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Infinite Bad Guy site. The “Bad Guy” video is in the middle, in front of a black and green background. Tags like “violin fam” and “instrumental” scroll across the bottom." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3LzfynuFF1itxMb_FY7gVaH-ajk=/121x0:1264x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867262/infinite_bad_guy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Infinite Bad Guy” featuring Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” music video. | Google/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aCxeYV"&gt;Somehow, perhaps by some cosmic intervention, I haven’t gotten tired of hearing Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” on the radio. Apparently, I’m not the only one because tens of thousands of people have gone to the effort of making covers of the song and uploading them to YouTube. In celebration of its music video passing 1 billion views, YouTube and Google Creative Lab have turned all of those covers into an interactive AI experiment. “Infinite Bad Guy,” which YouTube calls “the world’s first infinite music video,” collects thousands of covers and blends them together, using machine learning to align each one within quarter-beats of the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PZlBgP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OqY_IV3gj7E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIgorH"&gt;Going to &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;billie.withyoutube.com&lt;/a&gt; pulls up the original “Bad Guy” music video with cover videos on either side, set against a background of hundreds of tiny video thumbnails floating around a black void. When you click over from one video to another, the second will pick up on the same beat the first left off on. Pausing pulls up stats about how many covers you’ve watched and how many times you’ve played through a full loop of the song. When the song reaches the drop at the bridge, the color of the interface turns from green to red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gof5Pq"&gt;The fun thing is that they’ve also curated different tags that you can browse. There are predictable keywords like guitar, choir, and signing (for sign language covers) as well as some funkier selections like ASMR, cat, and… toy chicken? As I clicked around, I became less interested in the actual song and more in the variety of instruments, genres, and goofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dECuV6"&gt;It’s a cool premise, though not quite seamless. When I tried it out, there was a bit of a lag as each video loaded, so it doesn’t exactly satisfy the craving for a fluid DJ mix. Differences in quality are particularly evident when covers are played back to back — out of thousands of covers, not all of them are going to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; covers. Some of the “covers” are actually just homemade music videos set to the original audio. There also isn’t audio leveling from one video to the next, so you may end up fiddling with your volume as you travel through the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WaAt1"&gt;Despite some clunkiness, it’s an engaging way to spend a few minutes away from the usual algorithms. I recommend you &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;experience it yourself&lt;/a&gt; and see how many melodica solos you can get through before you close your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F89pgV"&gt;Ryan Kaji, the nine-year-old star of YouTube’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w"&gt;popular Ryan’s World channel&lt;/a&gt;, is expanding his empire with a new show on Amazon Kids Plus. This marks the first time that a YouTube creator has partnered with Amazon for an original series. The show will debut on November 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95dsek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Spy Ryan &lt;/em&gt;is a 30-minute live-action / animation hybrid series that follows Kaji as he’s transported to an animated world and tasked with recovering the Golden Console from a “nefarious hamster” named Packrat, according to a press release. The live-action sequences will feature Kaji and his family, who also appear frequently on his YouTube channel. The channel currently boasts close to 30 million subscribers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwfxHs"&gt;“Bringing &lt;em&gt;Super Spy Ryan&lt;/em&gt; as the first original on Amazon Kids Plus is a dream come true for us,” Shion Kaji, Ryan’s father, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seWOKE"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus is a subscription &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;package that costs $3 a month&lt;/a&gt; and gives kids an assortment of videos, books, games, and other entertainment items. The package also includes original content, and Amazon, like other companies, is looking to YouTube creators as a way to try to get kids to spend more time on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IOUzz"&gt;For Kaji and his family, expanding onto one of the world’s biggest websites is just another step in growing their business. Kaji currently has a show deal with Nickelodeon — a part of ViacomCBS’s plans to try to make Nickelodeon relevant again. His team also launched a Ryan and Friends OTT channel in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxlJK3"&gt;Other popular YouTube kids channels are in the process of expanding to streamers and networks. Cocomelon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;is now on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to deals made by its parent company, Moonbug, and HBO Max is partnering with YouTubers for original series. For streamers and networks, it makes sense: kids already know these characters and can watch new programming featuring their favorite YouTube channels on more secure platforms. Amazon will likely hope to bring over some of the audience from Ryan’s World and keep them on the site with other Amazon Kids Plus offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
