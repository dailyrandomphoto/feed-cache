    <title>YouTube borrows three more features from Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1QUPLH4pvuIGye3fP0oX9hOQE0=/108x0:768x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582952/clips.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube now supports creating clips from live streams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ko6jAb"&gt;YouTube is adding a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/117186067/availability-updates-for-clips-polls-subscribers-only-chat"&gt;trio of new features&lt;/a&gt; for live-streaming today that are all standbys for streamers on Twitch. Streamers will now be able to limit their chats to subscribers only, they’ll be able to create polls inside of their chats, and they and their viewers will now be able to create clips from popular gaming streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPCZS"&gt;These features have been around for a while on Twitch, and they’re all important tools to let streamers engage with their community. Limiting chats to subscribers only can help as a moderation tool by weeding out people who are just popping by, and it gives streamers another tool to encourage their viewers to start paying. And polls are useful for engaging with the often-chaotic chatrooms, giving streamers a simple way to ask for input on what they should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvJdSDt-qpukdRXmsKv-t0Vl0ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717893/Comp_5.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polls are now supported in live chats on YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EKC4Zt"&gt;Clips are also a critical tool for discovery. Since most people aren’t going to watch a multi-hour live stream, Twitch’s clipping tool allows fans to catch and share highlights, which can help bring new people to a streamer. YouTube is still limiting clips to gaming creators with more than 1,000 followers, though it says the feature will roll out to everyone eventually. Clips, like the chat features, had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254528/youtube-clips-alpha-twitch-mixer-facebook-livestreaming"&gt;been in testing&lt;/a&gt; with a limited number of creators until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWmHlO"&gt;While Twitch is still the dominant name in live-streaming, Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming have been growing. &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q4-live-streaming-industry-report-a898c98e73f1"&gt;According to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube had about a quarter of the market in terms of hours watched at the end of 2020, with Twitch representing about two-thirds of all viewership. YouTube has a long way to go to catch up, but adding in basic features like these can go a long way in supporting streamers and helping them grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s educational ‘Today at Apple’ classes are launching on YouTube with a Peanuts-themed session</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjaJIZ9WGSLKpmK_8KscUL0kTHk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580223/Snoopy02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn how to draw yourself as a &lt;/em&gt;Peanuts&lt;em&gt; character in the first “Today at Apple” YouTube session.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUqCvi"&gt;Apple is bringing its educational “Today at Apple” classes to YouTube, the company announced Wednesday. The first episode will show you how to draw yourself as a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; character in the company’s Pages app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU1Kgc"&gt;The session features two people who work on the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt; — showrunner Mark Evestaff and storyboard artist Krista Porter — and it’s hosted by an Apple Store employee named Anthony. I’ve watched the nearly 10-minute episode, and it’s a pretty easy guide to follow about turning yourself into a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; cartoon. Unsurprisingly, it’s packed with Apple technologies; Anthony and Porter draw on iPads using Apple Pencils, and they’re collaborating in the same Pages document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ijEdo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today at Apple” first launched in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQkzIU"&gt;Apple first announced the “Today at Apple” program in 2017 as a community-focused feature of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15419398/apple-store-redesign-genius-bar-grove"&gt;larger retail makeover&lt;/a&gt;. But the company has had to move &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftoday%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22576342%2Ftoday-at-apple-youtube-classes-sessions-peanuts-snoopy-show" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some sessions online&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, which forced Apple to close down many of its US retail stores. Although all 270 US stores reopened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the pandemic began, this new YouTube series signals that Apple is still working to build ways to educate its customers without requiring them to step inside a physical store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrHHJJ"&gt;The first episode of the series is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o3YkOQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayWPho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 9:15AM ET: Added the first episode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor YouTube Shorts is rolling out globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juIwLzvirtAuXeatna55CVymfTk=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574531/Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8407lx"&gt;YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rolling out globally. The service launched first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, before expanding to around 26 countries including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Now YouTube Shorts, which is still in beta, will be available “across more than 100 countries around the world where YouTube is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x07o4W"&gt;YouTube Shorts is playing catchup to TikTok as the short-form video platform of choice, but Google’s service is pushing Shorts’ integration with the wider YouTube ecosystem as a key selling point. It recently added the ability for Shorts creators to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;sample audio from YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, and says it’s exploring ways to offer quick links from Shorts to YouTube videos they’ve taken samples from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnfBI6"&gt;Ironically, while YouTube is going to great lengths to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. It recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;tripled its maximum video length&lt;/a&gt; to three minutes for everyone, and has been slowly rolling out apps on TV platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla’s RegretsReporter data shows YouTube keeps recommending harmful videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7XOziXhEzQHdu6xJFLUDxjEmFHk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554545/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANS1m3"&gt;That the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16222850/youtube-google-brain-algorithm-video-recommendation-personalized-feed"&gt;machine learning-driven feed&lt;/a&gt; of YouTube recommendations can frequently surface results of an edgy or even &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;radicalizing&lt;/a&gt; bent isn’t much of a question anymore. YouTube itself has pushed tools that it says could give users more control over their feed and transparency about certain recommendations, but it’s difficult for outsiders to know what kind of impact they’re having. Now, after spending much of the last year collecting data from the &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/"&gt;RegretsReporter extension&lt;/a&gt; (available for &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/regretsreporter/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/regretsreporter/obpoeflheeknapimliioeoefbfaakefn"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;), the Mozilla Foundation has &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-investigation-youtube-algorithm-recommends-videos-that-violate-the-platforms-very-own-policies/"&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; on what people see when the algorithm makes the wrong choice and has released &lt;a href="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Mozilla_YouTube_Regrets_Report.pdf"&gt;a detailed report&lt;/a&gt; (pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy7Iyk"&gt;In September 2020 the extension launched, taking a crowdsourced approach to find “regrettable” content that people encounter via the recommendation engine. After receiving 3,362 reports (along with data from people who installed the extension but did not submit reports), trends in the data show the danger in YouTube’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nWKZdm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube needs to admit their algorithm is designed in a way that harms and misinforms people.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cCeFRM"&gt;While the foundation says it kept the concept of a “regret” vague on purpose, it judged that 12.2 percent of reported videos violated YouTube’s own rules for content, and noted that about nine percent of them (nearly 200 in total) have been removed from YouTube — after accruing over 160 million views. As far as why those videos were posted in the first place, a possible explanation is that they’re popular — Mozilla noted that reported videos averaged 70 percent more views per day than other videos watched by volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVSeMP"&gt;Mozilla senior manager of advocacy Brandi Geurkink &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-investigation-youtube-algorithm-recommends-videos-that-violate-the-platforms-very-own-policies/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “YouTube needs to admit their algorithm is designed in a way that harms and misinforms people.” Still, two stats in particular jumped out to me from the study: Mozilla says “in 43.3 percent of cases where we have data about trails a volunteer watched before a Regret, the recommendation was completely unrelated to the previous videos that the volunteer watched.” Also, the rate of regrettable videos reported was 60 percent higher in countries where English is not a primary language. Despite the small sample size and possible selection bias of the data, it indicates there’s more to look at in places where people who primarily speak English aren’t even paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOMTFG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtubes-recommendations-still-push-harmful-videos-crowdsourced-study-rcna1355"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included a statement from YouTube regarding the report that claimed “over the past year alone, we’ve launched over 30 different changes to reduce recommendations of harmful content.” They had a similar response &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21436240/mozilla-browser-extension-youtube-crowdsource-recommendation-algorithm"&gt;when the project launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. Reforms suggested by Mozilla include transparency reports and the ability to opt-out of personalization, but with YouTube pulling in over $6 billion per quarter from advertising, pulling away from profiling seems doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3suFG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, July 14th, 10:15AM, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an earlier version of this story,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brandi Guerkink’s name was misspelled, and her title was misidentified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch a police officer admit to playing Taylor Swift to keep a video off YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7FiXKtWmKafKf16GxoylEUWPEGk=/241x0:1294x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529496/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_6.17.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image from the Anti-Police Terror Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WP4JV2"&gt;A confrontation Tuesday between a police sergeant and member of the public didn’t start out unusually. James Burch, policy director of the Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP), was standing outside the Alameda Courthouse in Oakland, California when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. As the two argued, the sergeant noticed he was being filmed. Then, he pulled out his phone and started playing “Blank Space” by Taylor Swift — in an apparent play to exploit copyright takedowns and keep the video off social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kDirp"&gt;“You can record all you want,” he said, according to a video obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I just know it can’t be posted to YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dblwjc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmZmo81Cdcc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAQscq"&gt;Bystanders have a First Amendment right to record police, but police officers &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/are-cops-playing-copyrighted-music-while-being-recorded-to-trigger-takedowns"&gt;have allegedly tried to exploit&lt;/a&gt; copyright law to prevent people from sharing those videos, playing music that could trigger a takedown notice. While playing music in the background of a video isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules, it can set off the company’s automatic takedown system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGVbOJ"&gt;In February, activist Sennett Devermont documented a Beverly Hills officer blasting Sublime’s “Santeria” on his phone after being asked questions, apparently to make the video more difficult to post online. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed"&gt;Devermont told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t an isolated incident, sharing an earlier video where a different officer used the same tactic with a Beatles song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvcvvr"&gt;In both cases, though, the officer didn’t directly admit to the practice. The Beverly Hills Police Department said playing music while answering questions is “not a procedure that has been recommended by Beverly Hills Police command staff” and that the videos were “currently under review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaa09"&gt;Now, there is explicit evidence of a police officer admitting to playing a popular song in order to keep a video off of YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHEiDc"&gt;Burch was at the courthouse on June 29th to support the family of Steven Taylor, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/san-leandro-shooting-walmart-police-steven-taylor"&gt;killed by San Leandro police officer Jason Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; while having a mental health crisis at Walmart. (Fletcher was later &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/California-Walmart-shooting-Jason-Fletcher-Steven-Taylor.html"&gt;charged with felony manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;.) He was listening to the pre-trial hearing with members of the Justice 4 Steven Taylor campaign when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIomY8"&gt;“You’re saying there’s a genuine concern we have that someone’s going to trip on this banner?“ Burch asked, according to the video. “You can’t keep twisting this...” the sergeant responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC9DHE"&gt;“This is as triggering as a situation can be for the family,” Burch tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “In our opinion a cop murdered their brother. Now we have cops marching out here telling us what to do? That is infuriating.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VegYV"&gt;When the sergeant whipped out his phone and started playing Taylor Swift, Burch was taken aback. “Are we having a dance party now?” he asked. “No, sir,” the sergeant said. “Are you playing pop music to drown out the conversation?” another APTP member asked. “No,” the sergeant responded. “He doesn’t want you recording so he’s playing music in the back,” Burch said. On camera, the officer said recording was fine — but posting it online wouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqF1FH"&gt;“The fact that these members of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department would go to such lengths to deny us the ability to publicize their actions speaks volumes to how they perceive their relationship with the People of Oakland,” Burch said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pC6I02"&gt;Police aren’t the only ones interested in exploiting online copyright systems. In 2019, one Twitter user posted a “tip” for deplatforming fascists by playing music at rallies, then reporting videos of it when they were posted online. Copyright reform advocate &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/23/double-edged-swords-r-us.html"&gt;Cory Doctorow called the idea&lt;/a&gt; a “clever hack,” but he called out its potential for abuse by other groups, specifically including police looking to avoid scrutiny online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns0Fxg"&gt;Social networks and copyright holders employ sometimes byzantine and often automated processes for detecting and removing copyrighted content. Users can appeal takedowns, but if they fail, receiving multiple strikes can limit an account’s monetization options or even get the user suspended. Meanwhile, automated systems can be overzealous at spotting supposed piracy, flagging even &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42580523"&gt;videos of white noise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/copyright-bots-and-classical-musicians-are-fighting-online-the-bots-are-winning/2020/05/20/a11e349c-98ae-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html"&gt;public domain classical music&lt;/a&gt;. They can also fail to identify videos that do include copyrighted material but would likely be protected as legal fair use. That’s made the system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220032/youtube-copystrike-blackmail-three-strikes-copyright-violation"&gt;ripe for abuse&lt;/a&gt; by scammers and other bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCv6kP"&gt;Videos like APTP’s don’t necessarily violate social media rules, but those rules aren’t very clear. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company’s restrictions take into consideration how much of the total video contains recorded music, the total number of songs in the video, and the length of individual songs in the video. In 2019, YouTube introduced a policy that discouraged copyright holders from claiming revenue on videos including brief or “unintentional” music clips, although it said that could temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806189/youtube-manual-music-copyright-claim-update-more-blocked-videos"&gt;lead to more blocked videos&lt;/a&gt;. Google declined to comment on how its policies would cover the Oakland video, instead pointing&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/safeguarding-copyright/"&gt;a page on how it protects copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzpg38"&gt;To Burch, the officer’s attempt to trigger a copyright takedown underlines why it’s important to film police interactions in the first place. “We know these agencies seek to avoid accountably,” he says. “It’s our job to be prepared in any situation to do the best we can to make sure the people in our community stay safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzLdKx"&gt;The Alameda County Sheriff’s Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DAZN will stream UEFA Women’s Champions League free on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Barcelona v Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Women’s Champions League Semi Final: Leg Two" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHx7j7BSA4c2Xh6Fbl-9Uuh5dbg=/0x0:4590x3060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523411/1232664409.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvyUiI"&gt;Sports streaming service DAZN announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to stream the UEFA Women’s Champions League. As part of the deal, an overwhelming majority of the matches it streams over the next four seasons will be available for free on its YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oByNYZ"&gt;DAZN — best known in the US as a hub for boxing events — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162594/dazn-international-expansion-200-countries-canelo-nfl-nhl"&gt;expanded to over 200 countries&lt;/a&gt; in December. It’s backed by billionaire Len Blavatnik who aspires to make DAZN the “Netflix of sport.” Former Disney exec Kevin Mayer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/kevin-mayer-on-leaving-disney-and-tiktok-joining-dazn-pay-tv-decline.html"&gt;joined DAZN as chairman in March&lt;/a&gt; to help make that happen, after Mayer abruptly quit TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;due to Trump’s meddling&lt;/a&gt;. While at Disney, Mayer led the development of the wildly successful Disney Plus service and was widely believed to be Bob Iger’s successor, only to be overlooked when Iger stepped down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DKnAf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first two seasons for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jW6BFl"&gt;In the deal announced Wednesday, DAZN says that it secured global streaming rights as well as broadcaster responsibilities through 2025. As part of its partnership with YouTube, DAZN said it will livestream the first two seasons for free on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3MFxm"&gt;The agreement makes 61 matches viewable in real time on the DAZN YouTube channel. During the 2023-2025 season, 19 of the 61 matches will be streamable on Google’s video service, while all 61 will be available through DAZN itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpRR0a"&gt;“DAZN is thrilled to be the new global broadcaster for UEFA Women’s Champions League and cannot wait to work with YouTube and Google to bring fans closer to the game and shine a brighter light on its stars than ever before,” DAZN Group co-CEO James Rushton said in a statement. “Overnight, this will make the best women’s football easier to watch around the world than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEAONO"&gt;The deal for exclusive global streaming rights does exclude several key markets, including the Middle East and North Africa as well as China. In the US, the service normally costs $20 per month or $100 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX0dj5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article stated that a 30-day trial of DAZN was available in the US. Though an English-language version of DAZN’s website in Japan says “everyone” gets a free trial, the company clarified after publication that the offer only applies in Canada, Spain, Japan, and select European markets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hasan Piker on the problem with YouTube debate culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wf9mi_iyM0HhWRZysFvCy0MmUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521065/acastro_210623_4645_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QFGFK7"&gt;Last week, a pair of YouTube’s most popular creators was set to spar in the marketplace of ideas &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/sam-seder-surprises-steven-crowder-ethan-klein-debate-youtube-2021-6"&gt;in a debate&lt;/a&gt; over the government’s simple, common sense advice to wear masks during a global pandemic to stop the persistent spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97s7R"&gt;The spat grew from a series of videos between right-wing provocateur Steven Crowder and the host of the &lt;em&gt;H3 Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, Ethan Klein, calling one another out for their purported bad takes on mask-wearing. In March, Crowder called out Klein for saying that “you shouldn’t think about” what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells you and just wear the mask, rather than criticizing the agency and its scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UakhL0"&gt;Crowder, who is widely known as the face of the “change my mind” meme, has challenged people to debates in the past, including college students on campuses all across the country. Klein, known for his comedy skits and pop culture commentary, is admittedly not the best debater. So instead of debating Crowder himself, Klein looped in Sam Seder, popular leftist host of &lt;em&gt;The Majority Report&lt;/em&gt;, as a surprise guest to take his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlYqWU"&gt;The “debate” immediately flamed out. Once Seder appeared on-screen, Crowder got squirrelly, slinging insults, and ultimately ditching the entire debate. Soon after recording, both Crowder and Klein released the footage. Both believed to have won by “owning” the other so publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lupA4"&gt;The whole fiasco raised serious questions about debate culture online and how platforms like YouTube and Twitch are influencing politics at large. I asked &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/style/hasan-piker-twitch.html"&gt;Hasan Piker&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Twitch commentator and former &lt;em&gt;Young Turks &lt;/em&gt;broadcast&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist, to talk about it. Piker has been a vocal critic of debate culture without shying away from his channel’s political clout. As he tells it, the “debate me” challenge is just a branding exercise — and it’s one he’s increasingly willing to skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp3nBI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPh8SA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to the Steven Crowder and Sam Seder debate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZqTt"&gt;Personally, I think all of this is just bullshit. I’ve done debates on the internet, and it’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive. I think it can help start a lot of people down the road of deradicalization, but what I have to recognize is that it fosters a really toxic environment. People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top dog debater is. So it turns into team sports. It’s not necessarily grounding your ideology in materialism, and instead, it’s just basically repeating talking points from the new intellectual daddy or father figure that you appreciate or enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWZ4vB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting you bring that up — the concept of team sports. When I watched the “debate” last week, my mind went straight to the Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley debates in the late ’60s. It felt like a moment where culture was beginning to override ideas, largely due to television as the medium for political debate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTCZAB"&gt;I’ll tell you another thing that’s ironic about the Vidal-Buckley debates. Those debates can be TLDR’d into one of them calling the other “queer” as a pejorative and then the other calls the other a “fascist.” If we look at that as the peak of intellectual debates, even back then, ultimately, they can still be reduced to the same shit-slinging operation. And you’re right, it is all about culture and personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVLXBe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of the debate last week, how do you think YouTube as a medium influenced the discussion? Each person was recording and could shape the discussion by changing the camera angles, muting someone, or turning their volume down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCEbqa"&gt;That’s a really unique perspective. I obviously talked about that on stream, but I never thought of the broader implications of it or considered how one-sided that is. It plays into the uneven playing field of the argument. Those decisions to alter camera angles were a deliberate attempt by Steven Crowder to stop his audience from recognizing what had happened in an effort to silence and seize full control ... And that was done in an effort to make himself seem more defensible in the eyes of his audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ytzm1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet has revolutionized the way people get their information. But at the same time, do you think it allows creators to control the narrative and decide their own winner on their platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQy63q"&gt;These debates are rarely about ideas, but instead a personal branding project. That’s probably why it hit so hard for Crowder to try and defend himself. Sorry, I’m simultaneously downloading &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to be playing that later on stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtzR6q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMAGLC"&gt;It’s probably dog shit. I hate golf. But it’s whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCWgaJ"&gt;Oh, yeah. For Steven Crowder, who has built his entire branding about how he is an intellectual type, much like Ben Shapiro has built his brand around being a guy who does debates and defeats liberals in the marketplace of ideas — it hits different. That’s why he had significantly more to lose. That’s what was going on. That’s why he had to take all the actions he did, and that’s why he kept dodging Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VLvb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now I want to get into a conversation about why you do what you do. I know there are a lot of people my age who get their news online and through these streamers. How do you feel about that responsibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e3mNG"&gt;It’s definitely something I think about a lot. I have a pretty stable moral grounding and worldview, and I try to do right by everyone and be as transparent as possible. I communicate that I do have biases just like everyone else. It’s pretty obvious when you come in. I do criticize the Democratic Party quite frequently and the Republican Party even more frequently than that. But that doesn’t mean I’m providing this purely neutral objective analysis. I think all the people who claim to be doing that are lying and benefiting from having the default position be neoliberal capitalism. If there’s injustice and you’re taking a neutral position in the face of injustice, you’re siding with the oppressor. You’re still not neutral. That’s my take on it. That’s why I do my commentary in the way that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNomD2"&gt;I try my best as humanly possible to read up in the limited amount of time I have leading up to a stream to prepare for the stream itself. And on top of that, I’m actively trying to make sure that I’m not misinforming anyone. I also have a pretty solid checking mechanism. If you’ve been in chat long enough, you know that as much as people like to talk about safe spaces or an echo chamber that I’ve cultivated in my community, I am not averse to criticism. I thrive in it. I love it. I look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrtP5I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see streaming and YouTube becoming more popular with younger people looking for new pundits and news online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS6pJ4"&gt;Well, there’s still going to be a need for journalists to make the news. I hope that never changes. I do worry that like — I’m an idiot. I’m an asshole. I don’t want the entire news media to be comprised of other idiot assholes like me. I know that what I do is basically supposed to be the reward after a career of doing journalism, and I get that. Op-eds are supposed to be rewards that you give to people who did 25 years out in like combat zones, for the most part sharking State Department propaganda and lying to them and stuff like that. Still, those people are putting in the work, and they finally get their comfortable office gig in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;or another reputable place, and then that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkyDNO"&gt;Now, what I do is a way to completely bypass that and even go beyond the office-gig economy, which is now turning into Substack and stuff like that. But if everyone wanted to do that, it would ruin everything. I still believe that journalists, like real journalists, should do real news, which I am not. I am not a real journalist. I’m not doing real news. I’m a commentator. I hope that never goes away. That would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIiNt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people that you’re interacting with on Twitch in chat, you’re accountable to them. They might unsubscribe. What’s that relationship like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjS7Vc"&gt;For the degenerate dumbasses that are op-ed writers and commentators like myself, what I do is absolutely a million times harder. I will say this with my chest: what I do, it looks like I’m sitting in a living room and shooting the shit, it is very easy. I’m not going to a fucking coal mine. But in comparison to what Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss do, what I do is a million times more difficult if you are so used to being in an ivory tower where you get very little criticism. All you need to do is just shut it off. Like your comments under your &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article are not going to drastically redefine your op-ed piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5N6RXH"&gt;My entire content revolves around constant back-and-forth communication, and it’s a very different layer of trying to control that. But I love that. I think that’s a good thing. As far as the take economy goes, I think what I do is pretty solid. I think it’s a good thing to have endless amounts of feedback from virtually every single person who wishes to do so, which is why I don’t have a sub-only feed. Some communities, when they grow to my size, the streamer will shut down their chat to subscriber-only. I don’t do that on purpose because I want to have these sorts of conversations with people, and I don’t want the money to prevent them from happening. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube wins naming rights for 6,000-seat event venue at Hollywood Park</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD_Ug9S_6q5slF7NqLPqmzwHsOk=/225x0:1635x940/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515360/youtube_theater_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Theater | YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VUAXLp"&gt;Google-owned YouTube will have its name on a new live event venue in Inglewood, California, part of the new Hollywood Park mixed-use development, the &lt;a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/youtube-partners-with-partners-hollywood-park-to-name-performance-venue-youtube-theater/"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube Theater will be a 6,000-seat performance venue, which will host concerts, comedy shows, YouTube creator events, esports competitions, and community shows. Financial terms of the multiyear naming rights deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VqNbr"&gt;The development is the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and part of the same complex as SoFi Stadium — where the Rams and Chargers play — and American Airlines Plaza. Hollywood Park also houses 3,000 apartments, a 300-room hotel, and an 890,000 square-foot retail area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oe7srF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH9RsPGyVzs?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=6&amp;amp;start=6" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVZEy"&gt;“YouTube Theater will drive the uniqueness of YouTube by combining physical, ‘in real life’ events that bring creators and fans together, while simultaneously sharing ​that same event​ experience with our two billion global monthly users through livestreams and VOD content,” YouTube vice president of brand marketing Angela Courtin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sySMu2"&gt;Upcoming performers at the three-story, 227,000-square foot YouTube Theater include Pitbull and Iggy Azalea, Black Pumas, and TLC with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The venue also has a 6,100-square-foot stage and a 3,500-square-foot private club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL9kjG"&gt;The theater will have a large-scale digital YouTube “play” button icon outside the venue, which can turn into an immersive video screen where guests can mirror themselves or view highlights from YouTube creators and artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUo4Gk"&gt;YouTube Theater is set to open for its first events later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMC2y4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV launches 4K and offline downloads today, but they don’t come cheap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpHb12cgzVzTNmGF1tJYch66rtE=/47x0:1679x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513791/yttv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs6oFt"&gt;YouTube TV is today revealing more details about two anticipated new features: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;4K playback and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, the service will be bundling them together in a new add-on package it’s calling &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365"&gt;“4K Plus.”&lt;/a&gt; There’s no getting one without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgIQe0"&gt;4K Plus is available starting today and will cost an extra $19.99 per month on top of the standard &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;$64.99 YouTube TV subscription&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds awfully expensive, but at least there’s this: customers will receive a free one-month trial — and if you sign up early, 4K Plus will be discounted to $9.99 each month for the first year. That’s easier to swallow than $20, but you’ll eventually be shifted over to the full price once that initial promotion expires. So for the first year, you’re looking at a $75 monthly bill, and $85 if you keep 4K Plus after that. Add in taxes and fees and, well, ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEnx_AJuL3FrzUmJv3RS2wYqA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690625/ezgif.com_video_to_gif_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jump to specific moments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HRDYrI"&gt;For now, offline downloads will likely be a bigger deal for many customers than 4K streaming. Outside of select sporting events, there’s still a dearth of 4K content on network and cable TV. (For that reason, some competing services like FuboTV don’t charge extra for 4K streams.) YouTube really isn’t in any position to solve that dilemma, but it’s promising that 4K Plus subscribers will be able to “watch major sports events this summer in 4K, plus live content from networks like NBC, sports like college football and basketball later this year, and on-demand content from FX, Discovery Networks, Tastemade and more.” You can search for “4K” to see all available 4K programs. YouTube TV is also preparing for the Olympics with new features that will let you quickly jump to specific sports or moments of an event without having to manually scrub through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9D2tT"&gt;When asked whether offline downloads will face any channel or content restrictions, YouTube told me that anything recorded to your cloud DVR from the base channel package can be downloaded to YouTube TV’s mobile app. So in theory, you shouldn’t run into any frustrating limitations or channels that block the feature. I’d hope for as much considering the price! However, the company noted that some premium network add-ons might not allow offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RKQLF"&gt;At least among streaming TV services, offline viewing is a rare convenience. Sling TV doesn’t offer it, and Hulu only &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads"&gt;supports offline downloads&lt;/a&gt; from its on-demand library of shows and movies. In the case of YouTube TV, you’re actually pulling down the entire DVR recording as it originally aired, so this approach is somewhat unique and Tivo-esque. YouTube told me that customers will have full control over playback, and rewind / fast-forward should work without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TofyPV"&gt;Adding 4K Plus to your account also enables “unlimited” concurrent streams for any devices that are on your home Wi-Fi network. YouTube TV usually limits customers to three simultaneous streams, and this will still apply for devices that are outside your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SAMJcH"&gt;Dolby 5.1 surround is coming to YouTube TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hZYHfx"&gt;In welcome news for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; YouTube TV customers, the service will also be introducing support for Dolby 5.1 surround sound “soon.” And this doesn’t require any special plan or add-on. YouTube says 5.1 audio has consistently been among the biggest feature requests from subscribers. It’ll be rolling out to “select devices” over the coming weeks. Smart TVs are first on the list, with other platforms to follow in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="inZKkl"&gt;YouTube took down several videos from a human rights organization’s channel, which was attempting to document human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang province, for violating its anti-harassment policy, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-youtube-takes-down-xinjiang-videos-forces-rights-group-seek-2021-06-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQvWt"&gt;On June 15th, Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights said the Google-owned video platform disabled its channel entirely, telling the group it had received too many strikes against its channel for videos where people displayed identification cards showing they were related to missing Xinjiang residents. That apparently broke YouTube’s rule against displaying personal information, which led to the videos’ removal. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5uns79sHr1AZiUw1ikV7PQ"&gt;The channel&lt;/a&gt; was restored three days later, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Iglq"&gt;YouTube reportedly asked Atajurt to cut out or conceal the IDs in the videos, but the channel’s administrator said  they didn’t want to do so out of concern that such action would damage its credibility. Atajurt has been praised by organizations including &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/21/silencing-activist-shows-kazakhstans-contempt-rights"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; for helping to expose human rights violations. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/24/1027048/youtube-xinjiang-censorship-human-rights-atajurt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atajurt posts testimonies from the family members of people detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9j5ec"&gt;Most of the videos that were removed have been restored following appeals, but some remained unviewable, and according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Atajurt is backing up its videos on blockchain-based video platform Odysee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goAjMA"&gt;A YouTube spokesperson said its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268?hl=en#zippy=%2Cother-types-of-content-that-violate-this-policy"&gt;harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; “clearly prohibits content revealing someone’s personally identifiable information, including their government identification or phone numbers,” adding that it enforces its policies “equally for everyone.” However, the spokesperson added, it recognized that the intent of posting the videos was not to “maliciously reveal” personal information. “Upon careful review of their appeal, we reinstated the channel and are working with Atajurt Kazakh to explain our policies so they can make the best decisions for their channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhMiCq"&gt;A June 10th &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; found that the Chinese government had conducted state-organized persecution, including torture, against people in Xinjiang provice in western China, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs. The United Nations has estimated that at least 1 million &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/22/china-rejects-uighurs-genocide-charge-invites-uns-rights-chief"&gt;Uyghurs are being held&lt;/a&gt; in internment camps in China, a claim that China has disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I75BZ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th 8:18AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from YouTube spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
