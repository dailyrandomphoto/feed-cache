    <title>YouTube reveals millions of videos get hit with incorrect copyright claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI4S5QatWSGpqfsLHMtN_DeS5CA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235302/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N4UQ5z"&gt;Over 2.2 million YouTube videos were hit with copyright claims that were later overturned between January and June of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the company today. The Copyright Transparency Report is the first of its kind published by YouTube, which says it will update biannually going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoWMD5"&gt;The 2.2 million incorrect claims represent less than 1 percent of the more than 729 million total copyright claims issued in the first half of this year, 99 percent of which originated from Content ID, YouTube’s automated enforcement tool. When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBHU5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5AssGC"&gt;Though mistaken copyright claims are a drop in the bucket on a larger scale, YouTube creators have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;long complained&lt;/a&gt; about how the platform handles claims, saying overly aggressive or unjustified enforcement can lead to lost income. Copyright claims can result in videos being blocked, audio being muted, or ad revenue going back to the rights owner. This new report gives shape to a problem that YouTube itself has acknowledged needs updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy1eAt"&gt;In 2019, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post that the company heard the concerns from creators and that YouTube was “exploring improvements in striking the right balance between copyright owners and creators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6hp6"&gt;The new report notes that “no system is perfect” and that errors happen even with established guardrails in place to prevent abuse of enforcement mechanisms. “When disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse, and over 60% of these disputes were resolved in favor of the uploader,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig’s livestream was interrupted by a copyright warning days after joining YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDebIKeFdsOfEX217bwtUVrhZEw=/208x0:2620x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228280/ludwig_youtube_suspended_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ludwig via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=API5Lt8t7Ho" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3oQbdo"&gt;Just three days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808873/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon-youtube-gaming"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren left his massive Twitch following for YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he was hit with what he thought was a suspension from the platform. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/former-twitch-subathon-star-ludwig-suspended-days-after-1848156400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ahgren was playing other YouTube videos during his stream, when he landed on the infamously catchy &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; song. His stream was shut down shortly thereafter, giving his viewers — and himself — the impression that he was banned for violating YouTube’s copyright policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LSzvcl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;you could say the switch has been going well... &lt;a href="https://t.co/dnkjSUkT0o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dnkjSUkT0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1466576027858001928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzAuO"&gt;However, Ahgren wasn’t actually struck with a copyright strike or a suspension. “Ludwig wasn’t suspended,” Lauren Verrusio, the head of creator and consumer communications at YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our Content ID tool picked up his playing of an unlicensed video while he was going live to fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSufM1"&gt;The whole incident was just a case of confusion. “If Ludwig were to have just stopped playing the copyrighted material, he could have continued the livestream just fine,” Verrusio explained. “But he wasn’t sure of what he was seeing on the backend and thought it was a suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx7RrR"&gt;Ludwig addressed the incident in a video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0"&gt;his secondary channel&lt;/a&gt;, in which he interprets the warning as a ban. “I’m pretty sure the corporate overlords who own &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down.” Verrusio notes that YouTube is in touch with Ahgren to explain the platform’s copyright rules, and that Ludwig plans on going live again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0k1Y"&gt;DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has caused issues across all video sharing and livestreaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;with creators getting videos unknowingly taken down and demonetized&lt;/a&gt; for having copyrighted material. Earlier this year, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;rolled out a tool&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to delete old videos that contain copyrighted music, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-wave-warning-notice"&gt;issued a wave of copyright strikes&lt;/a&gt; in response to DMCA complaints. Like Twitch, YouTube also operates with a three-strike policy — accrue three copyright violations and you’re permanently banned. To help soften DMCA’s blow, YouTube started telling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335728/youtube-checks-monetization-copyright-claim-dispute-tool"&gt;creators if their content contains copyrighted material&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their videos are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJkTE5"&gt;As Ludwig gets acquainted with his new streaming hub, his mistakes likely won’t go unnoticed. He currently has 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube, with more bound to trickle in from what’s left of his fanbase on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned you can surf YouTube on old Chromecasts with a hidden phone remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_z5iz2MVB7F30OanoCvntH1FHKk=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70225907/PXL_20211203_200442272.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O8oknN"&gt;Did you know the YouTube app on your older Chromecast has a hidden remote control that lets you surface an entire YouTube app that you can scroll?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I824Fk"&gt;You just need to start casting something to your TV in the YouTube app with the Cast button up top — then hit the Cast button a second time to access a menu where you’ll find a button labeled Remote. Then, you get a full D-pad to move around, a voice search button, and the all-important Back button you’ll need to back out of that video and access a full YouTube interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJiZDP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Watching YouTube on your TV with Google Chromecast? You can use your phone as a remote to cast and control the YouTube app on your TV. Here's how: &lt;a href="https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3"&gt;https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nAaYUKx0Sy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nAaYUKx0Sy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzSm8F"&gt;Originally, the Google Chromecast HDMI dongle required you to control it largely from your phone, “casting” each and every video you wanted to watch to your TV screen instead of browsing — until the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;2020 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; added its own physical remote.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6Obq5"&gt;But apparently, that changed. &lt;a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/youtube-chromecast-remote-hidden-ui-google-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; reported in February&lt;/a&gt; that the YouTube app on Chromecast had added a browsing experience with the hidden remote, and sites &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/03/youtube-app-chromecast-ultra/"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-brings-the-full-youtube-app-experience-to-your-older-chromecast/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that it’s broadly rolling out to older dongles like the third-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra. That’s a nice bonus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"&gt;if you recently nabbed the Ultra for $22.22&lt;/a&gt; in the Stadia sale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOXk9a2pITMYhEwCY8KjeqSPIJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061469/PXL_20211203_200908381.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0j1mdo"&gt;I can’t confirm when it rolled out, but I do see that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;Google’s support page has officially added instructions for using the remote&lt;/a&gt;, something that the Wayback Machine tells me wasn’t yet there back on, say, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211005012925/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, and the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760"&gt;tweeted about the feature&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH8Va3"&gt;The phone remote is a little laggy compared to using a dedicated remote or even using an iPhone to control an Apple TV, but it works fine so far on my Chromecast Ultra. I’d probably use it a lot if I valued YouTube’s recommendations more. (I don’t understand why it keeps recommending videos I’ve already watched and ones from many years ago.) I wish it were available in Netflix, where I do tend to scroll a lot, but I didn’t see the option there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU4e5X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig, the streamer who broke the all-time Twitch subs record this year, is moving to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzNFp2Yczx7EwQ9wT-oZj_12Q1k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207451/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_4.51.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ludwig posted a video announcing the move Monday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ludwig (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIliHG_yo7w" target="_blank"&gt;via YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfnDDg"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren, a streamer perhaps best known for his month-long subathon that took place earlier this year, is moving from Twitch to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1465442046328524805"&gt;stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Ahgren’s first stream on YouTube will take place tomorrow, November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dugxj"&gt;Ludwig leaves behind a significant presence on Twitch. He has &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig"&gt;3.1 million followers&lt;/a&gt;, and TwitchTracker’s metrics indicate he has more than &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/ludwig/subscribers"&gt;27,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. And by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22362532/ludwig-twitch-subathon-ends-stream-ninja-subs-record"&gt;end of his subathon&lt;/a&gt;, he had broken the all-time Twitch subs record — TwitchTracker says &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time"&gt;he peaked at 283,066 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. But he won’t be starting from nothing on YouTube, where he already has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA"&gt;2.08 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qKnqUl"&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEvye4"&gt;Ahgren is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube as of late, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652368/timthetatman-streaming-twitch-switch-youtube-gaming"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar’s&lt;/a&gt; jumps in August and September, respectively. YouTube also brought over Jack “CouRage” Dunlop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (who announced on November 23rd that he would &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CouRageJD/status/1463190958909054987"&gt;remain on the platform&lt;/a&gt;), and Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Cyber Monday streaming deals for Hulu, YouTube TV, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i_qBEMrD_E-nGxdLB9nlq4BpO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195034/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many can enjoy one year of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service for just $1 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCw3hh"&gt;Black Friday was longer than usual this year, with deals beginning weeks in advance, though Cyber Monday is the perfect end-cap to it. Several popular streaming services are offering a number of discounts for Cyber Monday. New and even some previous subscribers can, for example, enjoy a year of Hulu for just $0.99 a month. While that’s probably one of the best deals out there this year, other services are also great limited-time offers for new, past, and even existing subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best we’ve seen this year to help you get the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEXWCE"&gt;Also, if you’re looking for deals outside of streaming, be sure to also check out our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals happening now&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find discounts on everything from streaming devices and laptops to TVs and smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ovPPem"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"},{"title":"The Verge Cyber Monday 2021 live blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22807793/cyber-monday-2021-live-blog-lightning-deals-tech"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="5Nikh8"&gt;Get one year of Hulu for $0.99 a month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Frw4"&gt;Both new and returning customers can enjoy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.2655&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;type=4&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month if they subscribe before November 30th. Typically $7 a month — or $70, if you opt for an annual subscription — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. Under this plan, two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. You can also access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices. However, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DWyeal"&gt;New subscribers can get three months of TIDAL for $1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tjPTtO"&gt;New subscribers can get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Foffers%2Fblackfriday&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Tidal HiFi for just $1&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, you’ll essentially pay around $0.33 per month instead of $9.99 for unlimited access to more than 80 million songs and 350,000 music videos. Alternatively, you can&lt;small&gt; &lt;/small&gt;get three months of Tidal HiFi Plus — which typically costs $19.99 a month, and comes with perks like Dolby Atmos support&lt;small&gt; —&lt;/small&gt; for $2. The deal is valid through December 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVaWMP"&gt;Enjoy a free six-month trial of Apple Music and/or a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mBTg0q"&gt;Best Buy is offering new subscribers a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5ciwMOqeh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free six-month trial of Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, giving users ad-free access to 70 million songs. The retailer is also offering new subscribers &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5chUpry59" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. You must create a Best Buy account to take advantage of either deal, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IGhGjE"&gt;Pay $2 for two months of a YouTube TV add-on channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nnm3c2"&gt;YouTube’s streaming TV service is selling individual add-on channels for &lt;a href="https://t.co/Sexfs3XSv6?amp=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$0.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; for the first two months, assuming you’re a new add-on subscriber. The deal extends to 22 add-ons that typically range between $2 and $10 a month, including Cinemax, Showtime, Starz, AMC Plus, and more (HBO excluded). For the unfamiliar, add-ons are separate from the over 85 channels included in YouTube TV’s base plan. The offer expires on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JVWy1S"&gt;You can get $50 off your first month of YouTube TV’s base plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="18nbI4"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; interested in YouTube TV’s base plan, new subscribers &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can also try it free and then get $50 off their first month&lt;/a&gt;. The plan typically costs $65, so that means you’ll be paying $15 for more than 85 channels, including NFL, NBA, and MLB networks, PBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon. The plan also comes with unlimited cloud DVR storage space as well as rewind, fast forward, and pause capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="afZPNp"&gt;Amazon’s offering some channels for $0.99 per month for up to two months, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5zz7"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; more than 15 channels for $0.99 a month for up to two months as well. These include Paramount Plus Premium, Starz, Showtime, Discovery Plus, AMC Plus, PBS Masterpiece, Lifetime Movie Club, and more. This deal is only available to Prime members and will be valid through November 29th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Q9QRTD"&gt;New and existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers can get up to six months of Disney Plus for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wWW4MM"&gt;Meanwhile, new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can enjoy six months of Disney Plus for free.&lt;/a&gt; Amazon Music Unlimited starts at $7.99 per month, which is the same price as Disney Plus, so this could save you around $42. Current and former subscribers are both eligible to receive three months of Disney Plus for free under this deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c39mxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday weekend deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="QjGDNb"&gt;AMC Plus is offering a one-year plan for $1.99 per month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxUXd"&gt;If you’re ok with signing up with its annual plan, you can enjoy AMC Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.amcplus.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1.99 a month&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. That means you’ll be paying around $24, which is a 72 percent discount on the service’s typical roughly $84 per year price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koYNx8"&gt;Sign up for Showtime and pay $16 for five months instead of $55&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ8fKF"&gt;New subscribers can enjoy a 30-day free trial of &lt;a href="https://showtime.i7cdw9.net/c/482924/1168420/10655?subId1=VergeStreamingBF112621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.showtime.com%2Fsignup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; before paying $3.99 per month for four months. Normally, Showtime charges $10.99 per month, which means this is a 71 percent discount on a five-month membership, saving you $39. Unlike a lot of the other deals on this list, you have slightly longer to grab it, with the sale ending at 11:59PM PT on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hczf82"&gt;Get one month of Philo for $5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YMyWFx"&gt;Philo normally costs $25 per month, but right now you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philo.com/login/subscribe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get the first month of your membership for $5 instead&lt;/a&gt;. Those who have never opted in to use a free trial are also eligible for this deal. You can get the discount by entering the code &lt;strong&gt;BFCM &lt;/strong&gt;when signing up. This offer will last through the end of December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4BoKxS"&gt;Discovery Plus is offering a $3, three-month plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o5cqNJ"&gt;Discovery Plus is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2Fdp%2Fblack-friday-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; new subscribers the first three months of its ad-supported plan for $0.99 cents a month instead of $4.99. That means you’re getting 80 percent off the cost of a three-month subscription, paying $3 instead of $15. The deal ends on November 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dTvvKmRTPHWxC-fJ48tZp2zqKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041975/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_4.19.30_PM.png"&gt;

&lt;p id="crQDb2"&gt;New subscribers can get one month free of Paramount Plus’ ad-supported Essential plan or ad-free Premium ($9.99/month) plans &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1209284/3065?subId1=VergeBFStreaming112621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Faccount%2Fsignup%2Fplan%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt; until November 29th.

    <title>Roku promises to fix issues with HBO, Netflix, and more caused by 10.5 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dFj3liDlncB00d2m13fxzB-bHE=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180825/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WMV7R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;Roku says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working to fix issues that users have been reporting following its 10.5 software update. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/roku-customers-report-streaming-issues-after-10-5-update/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the problems&lt;/a&gt; earlier on Monday, citing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/"&gt;posts on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/"&gt;Roku forums&lt;/a&gt; where users said that apps like HBO Max, ESPN, Disney Plus, and more wouldn’t allow them to watch any video content after updating the OS on their smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY9bcR"&gt;According to Roku, “certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players” are affected by the problematic update. &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;In a post on its forum&lt;/a&gt;, the company instructs users with Roku Ultra models 4660, 4661, 4662, or 4670, and users with a Roku TV model 7XXX to manually check for a software update, and tells owners of other devices to subscribe to the thread for future details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1X0PKK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;System update got you down? We're aware of a small set of users on older Roku TVs or Roku Ultra who are experiencing issues after the OS 10.5 release and are working quickly to resolve. See our realtime updates here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS"&gt;https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roku Support (@RokuSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kG9r8V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Roku has been having users roll back their OS to a previous version on a case-by-case basis, after the user contacts support with information about their devices. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qzyz5g/downgrade_from_105_to_100/"&gt;at least one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; has reported seeing a prompt to “upgrade” from 10.5 to 10.0, Roku doesn’t mention that it’ll be widely offering a downgrade in its posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s65mnG"&gt;While Roku users have also reported issues with streaming using the YouTube TV app, that particular issue doesn’t appear to be limited to just one platform — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-tv-has-been-freezing-up-on-smart-tvs-everywhere/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube TV users have been having issues across almost every device, from streaming boxes like Apple TVs, Amazon Fire sticks, and even Google’s own Chromecasts, to consoles and smart TVs (though it notes that iOS and Android users seem unaffected). YouTube’s support team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462134163872624649"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a fix for the issue on Roku devices, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking into the issue on other devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrpS6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry to hear about the trouble – we've seen similar reports of YouTube TV freezing intermittently, and our team is looking into the issue. Mind sharing what device (model) you're using, and if this is happening to all programs? Appreciate your patience in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AMWhOl"&gt;While it’s certainly odd that the two issues appear to be happening at the same time, they don’t seem to be related given that YouTube TV users are seeing freezes regardless of device. Thankfully, both companies appear to be working on ironing out the problems. Roku is actively updating its support post with instructions to check for updates, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that YouTube TV is getting fewer outage reports on DownDetector.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vozi16"&gt;While the fix for Roku users may solve their problems with Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, their YouTube TV troubles may not be over — Roku and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;are actively feuding&lt;/a&gt; over the YouTube TV not being available on the platform’s store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;Google has threatened&lt;/a&gt; to stop distributing its regular YouTube app on Rokus as well come December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First ever YouTube video edited by co-founder to predict ‘decline’ of the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd7ssraebRp6KAN8yAq-Avc5Ums=/0x20:480x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154351/jawed_karim_at_the_zoo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim edited the description to YouTube’s first ever video (above) to make his opinion known. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkSkPL"&gt;Jawed Karim, the third co-founder of YouTube, has condemned the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773299/youtube-dislike-button-hide-public-count-numbers-small-creator-protection"&gt;removal of public dislike counts&lt;/a&gt; on videos, suggesting that the change will lead to YouTube’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwFVri"&gt;“Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed,” writes Karim. “The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mulkmj"&gt;YouTube made the change to its UI last week, saying it removed public dislikes in order to counter harassment and promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” But many YouTuber users and creators have criticized the decision, arguing that dislike counts give the community a way to express its preferences as well as quickly identify misleading and spam videos promoted by YouTube’s own algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQJyUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqE9cX"&gt;Karim has been getting his own message out in an unusual way: by editing the description to the first video ever uploaded to YouTube, a banal clip titled “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw"&gt;Me at the zoo”&lt;/a&gt; which stars the 25-year-old Karim himself. Karim originally edited the description of the video a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/13/youtube-me-at-the-zoo-dislike-protest/amp/"&gt;few days ago&lt;/a&gt; to read: “When every YouTuber agrees that removing dislikes is a stupid idea, it probably is. Try again, YouTube [face palm emoji].” But this morning he changed this description once again to give a more detailed condemnation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2RxyQ"&gt;“The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform,” writes Karim. “Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. [...] The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vySy4g"&gt;It’s not the first time Karim has used the “Me at the zoo” video as an informal billboard for his opinions on the platform. In 2013, when YouTube announced it would use Google Plus to power comments — a move which many saw as a way for the search giant to force increased engagement for its doomed social network — Karim &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/08/youtube-cofounders-first-public-comment-in-8-years-why-the-f-do-i-need-a-google-account-to-comment-on-a-video/"&gt;changed the video’s description&lt;/a&gt; to read: “why the fuck do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uddM4j"&gt;In his statement today, Karim compares the video in which Matt Koval, YouTube’s “creator liason,” &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kxOuG8jMIgI"&gt;announced the removal of dislikes&lt;/a&gt; to infamous footage of US soldier Jeremiah Denton, who was captured during the Vietnam War. In 1966, Denton was forced to give a television interview by his captors, during which he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/03/29/296211985/j-denton-fo"&gt;blinked in Morse code&lt;/a&gt; to spell out the word “torture.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHB4C"&gt;You can read Karim’s latest update in full below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="description"&gt;The spoken words did not match the eyes. The video reminded me of an interview Admiral Jeremiah Denton gave in 1966. I have never seen a less enthusiastic, more reluctant announcement of something that is supposed to be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4enGm"&gt;Calling the removal of dislikes a good thing for creators cannot be done without conflict by someone holding the title of “YouTube’s Creator Liaison”. We know this because there exists not a single YouTube Creator who thinks removing dislikes is a good idea — for YouTube or for Creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg5Gmb"&gt;Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed. Instead, there will be references to various studies. Studies that apparently contradict the common sense of every YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDLu0l"&gt;The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. The idea was never that all content is good. The idea WAS, however, that among the flood of content, there are great creations waiting to be exposed. And for that to happen, the stuff that’s not great has to fall by the side as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrdchD"&gt;The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre? Because nothing can be great if nothing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3HaD"&gt;In business, there’s only one thing more important than “Make it better”. And that’s “Don’t fuck it up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to being able to see the like-to-dislike ratio as soon as they click on a video and may use that number to decide whether to continue watching. Now, that will no longer be an option, but it could close off a vector for harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgloWJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenting “I just came here to dislike” may be less satisfying when you don’t see a number go up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQZsH"&gt;YouTube says that when it tested hiding dislike numbers, people were less likely to use the button to attack the creator — commenting “I just came here to dislike” was seemingly less satisfying when you don’t actually get to see the number go up. That behavior may still continue to some extent, though, as creators will be able to see the dislike numbers for their own video in YouTube Studio. The company says this still lets well-meaning viewers leave private feedback to content creators or use dislikes to tune the algorithm’s video recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGq2dz"&gt;Other social networks have given users the option to hide rating metrics, too — Instagram and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454428/facebook-instagram-hide-like-counts-feature-now-available"&gt;famously let you hide like counts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to avoid the potential social pressure that comes with having your main measure of success on the platform shown to everyone. It’s not exactly a perfect comparison — the number of likes your YouTube video gets will still be public (if you leave public ratings on), and Instagram hasn’t turned off likes site-wide yet, but it shows a growing concern with what data creators have access to versus what data their audiences have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="to6BTf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube itself has the most disliked video on YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwRna0"&gt;Dislike counts going private could help hide an embarrassing piece of YouTube history: the most disliked video on the entire site is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;the company’s own Rewind from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. That particular recap video sparked so much ire that YouTube recently announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;the annual Rewind videos were canceled&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an argument that not being able to see public dislikes could lead to users watching a video that’s not very good — an insincere apology, perhaps, or informative-looking content that ends up being an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJzMu8"&gt;Still, YouTube’s argument that it wants to protect smaller creators from dislike mobs or harassment is one that’s hard to argue against. It’s easy to imagine workarounds for some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;the other ideas it floated to combat that behavior&lt;/a&gt;, which included requiring extra info on why you were disliking the video or graying out the dislike button until you’d watched a certain amount of the video. Instead, people leaving dislikes will be doing so for the creator’s eyes only — and screaming into the void just isn’t the same as publicly booing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking policy reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hoTDKd"&gt;An investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple’s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt; that requires apps to ask permission to track users’ data. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;policy went into effect in April&lt;/a&gt;, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoOi1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;Facebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money “in absolute terms” when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap “fared the worst as a percentage of its business” because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn’t have a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sje4f6"&gt;“Some of the platforms that were most impacted — but especially Facebook — have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,” adtech consultant Eric Seufert told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;. “My belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahNYi"&gt;Apple’s new policy will force social platforms and other apps to get more creative with their advertising. Whether this means focusing on Android devices or investing in Apple’s advertising business — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654121/apple-personalized-ads-ios-15-prompt-app-tracking"&gt;which nearly broke its own rules&lt;/a&gt; by quietly collecting user data in the same way third-party apps did —  they’ll have to figure out another source of revenue that doesn’t involve tracking people on their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKAdRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok and Snap want to prove they’re not Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFAqJB"&gt;Snap, TikTok, and YouTube set out with one important goal for Tuesday’s Senate hearing on child safety: to convince lawmakers that they are nothing like Facebook. While lawmakers were encouraged by the companies’ transparency, their humble approach hasn’t dissuaded lawmakers from pursuing new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZb8Vv"&gt;While YouTube’s parent company Google has testified before, it was the first time representatives from Snap and TikTok testified before Congress, and they came prepared to differentiate themselves from the social media giant at the center of yet another series of scandals. It was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaks that led senators to pursue these hearings. The Facebook Papers loomed over the event, reinforcing Snap and TikTok’s desire to set themselves apart and promising Congress greater transparency into their internal research and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqQEAM"&gt;“Snapchat was built as an antidote to social media,” Jennifer Stout, Snap’s vice president of global public policy, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0AACA9BA-49C8-4AC3-8C2E-E62ACC3F73BC"&gt;said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to remove Snapchat from the Facebook comparison. “In fact, we describe ourselves as a camera company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0mBw"&gt;“TikTok is a global entertainment platform where people create and watch short-form videos,” said Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of public policy for the Americas. Beckerman continued, noting that direct messages and other social features are turned off by default for young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhKFBk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6U11zl"&gt;Still, the testifying companies’ statements did not quell lawmakers who feared these platforms could be used in the same harmful ways as Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lGbmp"&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Tuesday. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5tH2j"&gt;Before Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers brought in Facebook head of safety Antigone Davis and whistleblower Frances Haugen to discuss how the company’s products, like Instagram, drive young users to content encouraging self-harm and unhealthy behaviors. For years, lawmakers have vowed to produce new legislation to protect children online, but recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting on a cache of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen breathed new life into their willingness to regulate tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8tc3k"&gt;Specifically, lawmakers pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal research&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook noting that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfG0Nd"&gt;At a September hearing, lawmakers noted Davis’ unwillingness to answer questions and her refusal to publish Facebook’s entire body of research on the effects its platforms have on young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2jJXW"&gt;“I don’t understand, Ms. Davis, how you can deny that Instagram isn’t exploiting young users for its own profits?” Blumenthal asked her at the time. “This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkyrYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPEuE"&gt;While Facebook may have refused to publish the research, reporters from a variety of different news publications gained access to additional documents leaked by Haugen and authored a deluge of articles on Monday examining Facebook’s own research and documents on teens and other issues like content moderation lovingly titled the “Facebook Papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4mP7G"&gt;Clearly, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube didn’t want to be on the receiving end of their own “Papers” scandals. During Tuesday’s hearing, all three companies committed to releasing research, data, and independent studies they have conducted to Congress. Lawmakers like Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said that the committee could send these documents to independent experts to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1aUzD"&gt;In a press call with reporters Tuesday, Blumenthal said that his subcommittee would “hold them” to that promise and that lawmakers were “going to pursue legislation,” including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058562/eraser-button-childrens-data-coppa-walberg-rush-hawley-markey-congress-house"&gt;the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPPA) and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;potential markup on the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bill would place new limits on the types of features and content tech companies could provide for children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWuw8t"&gt;Even as Snap, TikTok, and YouTube try to remove themselves from Facebook’s toxic regulatory groundswell, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;tried to pull them closer&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s latest earnings call on Monday. Zuckerberg explained that the company has made changes to its services to support older users, many of whom don’t use platforms like Snap and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MOecf"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. Later, he called TikTok “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” He also announced that the company would refresh Instagram’s app design, making its Reels product “a more central part of the experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels is Facebook’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s growing popularity with young people, allowing users to post videos in a similar style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQt9Jq"&gt;Still, it’s unclear when the companies that testified Tuesday plan to release the internal reporting. Snap, TikTok, and YouTube did not immediately answer requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the timing of these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4r7ys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Vics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
