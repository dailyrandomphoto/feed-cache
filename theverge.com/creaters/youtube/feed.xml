    <title>YouTube gives dislikes the thumbs-down, hides public counts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JAirWZ9ULkKMC5lbId49dI2yKU=/49x0:913x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122512/Exvh5P5WUAg5Nwy.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;YouTube has announced that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to being able to see the like-to-dislike ratio as soon as they click on a video and may use that number to decide whether to continue watching. Now, that will no longer be an option, but it could close off a vector for harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgloWJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenting “I just came here to dislike” may be less satisfying when you don’t see a number go up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQZsH"&gt;YouTube says that when it tested hiding dislike numbers, people were less likely to use the button to attack the creator — commenting “I just came here to dislike” was seemingly less satisfying when you don’t actually get to see the number go up. That behavior may still continue to some extent, though, as creators will be able to see the dislike numbers for their own video in YouTube Studio. The company says this still lets well-meaning viewers leave private feedback to content creators or use dislikes to tune the algorithm’s video recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGq2dz"&gt;Other social networks have given users the option to hide rating metrics, too — Instagram and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454428/facebook-instagram-hide-like-counts-feature-now-available"&gt;famously let you hide like counts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to avoid the potential social pressure that comes with having your main measure of success on the platform shown to everyone. It’s not exactly a perfect comparison — the number of likes your YouTube video gets will still be public (if you leave public ratings on), and Instagram hasn’t turned off likes site-wide yet, but it shows a growing concern with what data creators have access to versus what data their audiences have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="to6BTf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube itself has the most disliked video on YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwRna0"&gt;Dislike counts going private could help hide an embarrassing piece of YouTube history: the most disliked video on the entire site is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;the company’s own Rewind from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. That particular recap video sparked so much ire that YouTube recently announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;the annual Rewind videos were canceled&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an argument that not being able to see public dislikes could lead to users watching a video that’s not very good — an insincere apology, perhaps, or informative-looking content that ends up being an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJzMu8"&gt;Still, YouTube’s argument that it wants to protect smaller creators from dislike mobs or harassment is one that’s hard to argue against. It’s easy to imagine workarounds for some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;the other ideas it floated to combat that behavior&lt;/a&gt;, which included requiring extra info on why you were disliking the video or graying out the dislike button until you’d watched a certain amount of the video. Instead, people leaving dislikes will be doing so for the creator’s eyes only — and screaming into the void just isn’t the same as publicly booing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking policy reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODq4yfj5scuSF17cA4aH0w65c7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70072075/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hoTDKd"&gt;An investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple’s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt; that requires apps to ask permission to track users’ data. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;policy went into effect in April&lt;/a&gt;, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoOi1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;Facebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money “in absolute terms” when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap “fared the worst as a percentage of its business” because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn’t have a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sje4f6"&gt;“Some of the platforms that were most impacted — but especially Facebook — have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,” adtech consultant Eric Seufert told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;. “My belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahNYi"&gt;Apple’s new policy will force social platforms and other apps to get more creative with their advertising. Whether this means focusing on Android devices or investing in Apple’s advertising business — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654121/apple-personalized-ads-ios-15-prompt-app-tracking"&gt;which nearly broke its own rules&lt;/a&gt; by quietly collecting user data in the same way third-party apps did —  they’ll have to figure out another source of revenue that doesn’t involve tracking people on their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKAdRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZxYO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok and Snap want to prove they’re not Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Committee Examines Protecting Kids Online" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsFx3GtQ5ZSGIRYJOBVMPhkvnyw=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049017/1236142202.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFAqJB"&gt;Snap, TikTok, and YouTube set out with one important goal for Tuesday’s Senate hearing on child safety: to convince lawmakers that they are nothing like Facebook. While lawmakers were encouraged by the companies’ transparency, their humble approach hasn’t dissuaded lawmakers from pursuing new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZb8Vv"&gt;While YouTube’s parent company Google has testified before, it was the first time representatives from Snap and TikTok testified before Congress, and they came prepared to differentiate themselves from the social media giant at the center of yet another series of scandals. It was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaks that led senators to pursue these hearings. The Facebook Papers loomed over the event, reinforcing Snap and TikTok’s desire to set themselves apart and promising Congress greater transparency into their internal research and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqQEAM"&gt;“Snapchat was built as an antidote to social media,” Jennifer Stout, Snap’s vice president of global public policy, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0AACA9BA-49C8-4AC3-8C2E-E62ACC3F73BC"&gt;said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to remove Snapchat from the Facebook comparison. “In fact, we describe ourselves as a camera company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0mBw"&gt;“TikTok is a global entertainment platform where people create and watch short-form videos,” said Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of public policy for the Americas. Beckerman continued, noting that direct messages and other social features are turned off by default for young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhKFBk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6U11zl"&gt;Still, the testifying companies’ statements did not quell lawmakers who feared these platforms could be used in the same harmful ways as Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lGbmp"&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Tuesday. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5tH2j"&gt;Before Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers brought in Facebook head of safety Antigone Davis and whistleblower Frances Haugen to discuss how the company’s products, like Instagram, drive young users to content encouraging self-harm and unhealthy behaviors. For years, lawmakers have vowed to produce new legislation to protect children online, but recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting on a cache of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen breathed new life into their willingness to regulate tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8tc3k"&gt;Specifically, lawmakers pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal research&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook noting that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfG0Nd"&gt;At a September hearing, lawmakers noted Davis’ unwillingness to answer questions and her refusal to publish Facebook’s entire body of research on the effects its platforms have on young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2jJXW"&gt;“I don’t understand, Ms. Davis, how you can deny that Instagram isn’t exploiting young users for its own profits?” Blumenthal asked her at the time. “This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkyrYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPEuE"&gt;While Facebook may have refused to publish the research, reporters from a variety of different news publications gained access to additional documents leaked by Haugen and authored a deluge of articles on Monday examining Facebook’s own research and documents on teens and other issues like content moderation lovingly titled the “Facebook Papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4mP7G"&gt;Clearly, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube didn’t want to be on the receiving end of their own “Papers” scandals. During Tuesday’s hearing, all three companies committed to releasing research, data, and independent studies they have conducted to Congress. Lawmakers like Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said that the committee could send these documents to independent experts to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1aUzD"&gt;In a press call with reporters Tuesday, Blumenthal said that his subcommittee would “hold them” to that promise and that lawmakers were “going to pursue legislation,” including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058562/eraser-button-childrens-data-coppa-walberg-rush-hawley-markey-congress-house"&gt;the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPPA) and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;potential markup on the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bill would place new limits on the types of features and content tech companies could provide for children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWuw8t"&gt;Even as Snap, TikTok, and YouTube try to remove themselves from Facebook’s toxic regulatory groundswell, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;tried to pull them closer&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s latest earnings call on Monday. Zuckerberg explained that the company has made changes to its services to support older users, many of whom don’t use platforms like Snap and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MOecf"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. Later, he called TikTok “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” He also announced that the company would refresh Instagram’s app design, making its Reels product “a more central part of the experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels is Facebook’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s growing popularity with young people, allowing users to post videos in a similar style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQt9Jq"&gt;Still, it’s unclear when the companies that testified Tuesday plan to release the internal reporting. Snap, TikTok, and YouTube did not immediately answer requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the timing of these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4r7ys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Vics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Kids’ new monetization policy could defund consumeristic videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1swq_OHwPERLFsYRvkrBhympAs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046925/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P85I9Q"&gt;YouTube is making it harder for kids’ videos that it deems “low quality” to qualify for monetization (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-low-quality-demonetization-kids-video-194733880.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform outlined its updated policies &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/"&gt;in a post on the YouTube Blog&lt;/a&gt;, noting that channels with “made for kids” content will need to abide by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content"&gt;a stricter set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; if they want to stay in the YouTube Partnership Program (YPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqd41d"&gt;Its policies are meant to discourage kids’ content creators from pushing out videos that it describes as “heavily commercial or promotional” or if it encourages “negative behavior or attitudes.” If a channel violates these guidelines, YouTube may suspend them from YPP. Meanwhile, any individual videos that break the rules will lose advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHMgv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality ‘made for kids’ content, it may be suspended from the YouTube Partner Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMtb7N"&gt;YouTube’s new guidelines could impact a number of channels, including one of the biggest kids’ channels on YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w"&gt;Ryan’s World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;Ryan Kaji is a 10-year-old YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; whose videos garner millions of views. At this time of writing, his channel currently has 30.8 million subscribers. Kaji’s massive popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;has landed him a show on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152447/ryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji"&gt;a virtual world on Roblox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5LcWm"&gt;A large number of Kaji’s videos revolve around unboxing toys, as well as showing off toys that Kaji has helped create. It’s definitely what one would describe as “consumeristic” — which is what YouTube says it’s trying to cut down on. YouTube says that it has “reached out to potentially impacted creators” to help them prepare before the policies go into effect in November. If Ryan’s World wants to remain one of the most popular YouTube channels for kids, it may need to make major adjustments to the kind of content it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFsuai"&gt;The most recent major change to kid-focused content took place in early 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051465/youtube-coppa-children-content-gaming-toys-monetization-ads"&gt;when YouTube banned targeted advertising, comments, and some community features&lt;/a&gt; for kids’ videos. Just this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298179/youtube-supervised-experiences-content-levels-children-parents"&gt;YouTube rolled out “supervised experiences”&lt;/a&gt; to help parents gain more control of what their older children watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku calls out Google over YouTube contract stalemate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDXz5UnZzmDFuAoumDbn832oXIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025930/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R77EXb"&gt;Tensions between Roku and Google spilled over to customers in a new blog posted by the streaming service on Thursday. After months of failed negotiations for Roku to maintain the YouTube app, the company is accusing Google of anti-competitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIX9YD"&gt;Responding to the deadlocked negotiations, Google said that it would end all distribution of YouTube on new Roku devices after December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJq23"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Roku accused Google of making anti-competitive demands in carriage agreements, like requiring Roku to implement a dedicated YouTube search results row in the Roku interface. Roku also alleged that Google overrides music voice search and blocks relevant searches outside of YouTube’s own results while users are in the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLD5XS"&gt;“Doing business with an enterprise as powerful as Google creates complex challenges,” the blog post said. “Importantly, our concerns with Google are not about money. We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement. In fact, Roku does not earn a single dollar from YouTube’s ad supported video sharing service today, whereas Google makes hundreds of millions of dollars from the YouTube app on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZoqVB"&gt;Outside of these demands being hostile to consumers, Roku also alleged that Google’s requirements give it access to vast amounts of consumer data related to what Roku users watch on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLp2bb"&gt;Roku’s deal to distribute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;the YouTube TV app expired in April&lt;/a&gt; and the company removed the app from its store after failing to reach a new agreement with Google. Roku has consistently accused Google of making unfair demands while not requiring similar data-sharing and search features on other platforms like Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxugc"&gt;“Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYp5b"&gt;The blog comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bipartisan bill to combat anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt; behavior in the tech industry was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would ban similar behaviors alleged by Roku in its Thursday blog, like self-preferencing and discriminating against competitors’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2w4be"&gt;“Roku supports bipartisan efforts such as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to modernize our competition laws, promote innovation, and protect consumers in the Digital Age,” said John Kelly, Roku senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications at Roku in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/support-builds-for-bipartisan-legislation-from-klobuchar-grassley-and-colleagues-to-rein-in-big-tech"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBzllf"&gt;Roku told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday that company representatives were in contact with lawmakers over these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesJzu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/21/19 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wClyRx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGiguxru9rzApZKuJIVKuBLCoGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967245/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and YouTube will cut off ad money for climate change deniers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TFjnh6ir5kwdKu91SpykoqB3Ac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965820/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoHg1u"&gt;Google will no longer allow advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators to monetize content that denies the existence of climate change. The company detailed the changes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOxbM6"&gt;“Today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” the Google Ads team said in the document. “This includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3ybf"&gt;Google says it will use a mix of automated tools and human reviews to enforce the policy. “When evaluating content against this new policy, we’ll look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim,” Google said. Ads will still be allowed on climate topics like public debates on climate policy, research, and more, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWCsgW"&gt;The increased action against climate change deniers marks Google’s second big misinformation policy change in recent days, arriving about a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700171/youtube-vaccine-misinformation-antivax-ban"&gt;YouTube banned vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It follows new features announced by the search giant intended to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711623/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-footprint-maps-search-travel"&gt;shrink their carbon footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube cancels Rewind for good after years of everyone hating it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Will Smith in Rewind" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJbJjrli6W_ED6p4PlockymRPW0=/74x0:1370x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964471/Screen_Shot_2019_02_05_at_3.24.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2jX8n"&gt;YouTube Rewind — the company’s annual year-end round-up of trends, creators, memes, and the most popular videos on the site — has been canceled for good, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/10/07/youtube-no-longer-making-year-end-rewind-videos/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4eZN7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all the creators involved in Rewind - we’ll be   for your Rewinds as we refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube   with a different and updated kind of experience - stay tuned! → &lt;a href="https://t.co/kI69C24eL0"&gt;https://t.co/kI69C24eL0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube Creators (@YouTubeCreators) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeCreators/status/1446103025500577796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXGom"&gt;Instead, YouTube will “refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube [fire emoji] with a different and updated kind of experience,” although the company didn’t elaborate further on what it’ll be replacing Rewind with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeBa8l"&gt;YouTube will also be relying on creators on its platform to fill the gap, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll “continue to be inspiring to see the myriad of ways the most creative content producers in the world — our YouTube creators — encapsulate the end of year in their video recaps, as YouTube retires its own Rewind video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsiA"&gt;The news of YouTube canceling Rewind permanently isn’t a huge surprise. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1326947861305696263"&gt;already took off 2020&lt;/a&gt;, citing the difficulties of the year: “2020 has been different. And it doesn’t feel right to carry on as if it weren’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HCw9Sy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is canceling Rewind this year because 2020 has been too much ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562697/youtube-rewind-canceled-2020-pandemic-creators-community"},{"title":"PewDiePie makes his return to YouTube Rewind after two years of controversy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"},{"title":"YouTube Rewind 2018 is officially the most disliked video on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mInJcb"&gt;But Rewind had already been struggling long before the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;2018’s video&lt;/a&gt; was viciously panned by the YouTube community (to this day, it remains the most disliked video ever posted to the platform). Creators argued that the company was shifting focus from the “real community” — including controversial creators like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy"&gt;Logan Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095517/pewdiepie-t-series-youtube-fan-campaign-subscribers"&gt;PewDiePie&lt;/a&gt; — in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;more advertiser-friendly choices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u9LMp"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"&gt;2019’s video&lt;/a&gt; attempted to skirt controversy entirely by shifting its format from the big-budget mashup of YouTubers from years past to a more ordinary (and boring) list of clips of most-watched creators, videos, and trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s1yZV"&gt;But whether well-received or endlessly dunked on, Rewind videos have been a big part of YouTube’s culture for the past decade. Hopefully, whatever YouTube does end up doing to replace its big year-end celebration ends up a little less controversial going forward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCS0PP8jNbuypyRbk4vOZm5qOas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948062/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;
