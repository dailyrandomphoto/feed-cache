    <title>YouTube TV is expanding its Spanish-language programming</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSELjq"&gt;YouTube TV is expanding its live TV channels to include more Spanish-language content and add-on options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olKgVY"&gt;The company announced that beginning today, three new Spanish-language networks — Univision, UniMás, and Galavisión — would be joining the YouTube TV experience at no additional cost to subscribers. Notably, the new networks will include coverage of two events that are just around the corner: the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards premiering on November 18th and the Campeones Cup airing on September 29th. This week’s announcement corresponds with the start of Hispanic Heritage Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I8hZJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CNN Español, Fox Deportes, and more will be offered as a paid add-on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1U0tlf"&gt;Local programming from Univision and UniMás will also be available to subscribers in select markets, including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, among other cities. Univision’s addition to the platform, meanwhile, will also give YouTube TV users access to the company’s on-demand content as well as the ability to log into the Univision app using their YouTube TV information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7Mgk"&gt;Univision networks aren’t widely available on streaming TV services — they’re missing from Hulu and Sling, for instance — which could give YouTube an edge as it looks to pick up new customers. (Univision has its own streaming goals: it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544041/univision-streaming-service-announcement-free-premium"&gt;launch a new streaming service&lt;/a&gt; next year with ad-supported and paid plans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2NkYS"&gt;For viewers looking to unlock more Spanish-language programming beyond the new networks, YouTube will also offer a new add-on option that includes networks like Sony Cine, CNN Español, Discovery en Español, Estrella TV, Cinelatino, and Fox Deportes, among others. YouTube said this add-on will be made available in the “coming months,” and the package’s cost and a full slate of included networks will be announced a little closer to its launch date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz9kzJ"&gt;Lastly, the company will soon introduce a separate add-on for Pantaya, an on-demand streaming service for Spanish-language movies, for $6 a month. That add-on will become available to YouTube TV users in the coming weeks. YouTube TV, which offers over 85 channels, currently costs $65 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is also forcing the popular Rythm Discord music bot offline </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wA-3YNXlFdmXgcSaGFnBGjR8c60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848936/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K93Z0F"&gt;Just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;forcing the Groovy Discord music bot offline&lt;/a&gt;, Google-owned YouTube is now turning its attention to Rythm, the most popular music bot on Discord. The search giant has sent a cease and desist to the owners of Rythm, a bot that lets Discord users play music from YouTube videos and has more than 560 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvw7mv"&gt;Google wants the Rythm bot closed down within seven days, and the service is complying by shutting down its bot on September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bVchm"&gt;Rythm is currently installed on more than 20 million Discord servers alone. Rythm has more than 560 million Discord users, and 30 million of them actively use the service each month. Given Discord has 150 million monthly active users, this shutdown is a huge blow to a core feature of Discord that’s used by around 20 percent of its userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlIwuS"&gt;“One way or another we knew this was due to happen eventually,” admits Yoav, the creator of Rythm bot, in a Discord message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Which is why we started working on something new a year ago. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;Groovy receiving one&lt;/a&gt; just meant it would happen sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opO928"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is forcing the popular Groovy Discord music bot offline ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MU3Mkw"&gt;The Rythm bot team is working on “something new in the music space that we’re very excited about,” says Yoav. There will be some form of connection to Discord, but the team isn’t ready to talk more about their upcoming project just yet. Rythm has been a full time job for Yoav, and it took 16 servers with more than 4TB of RAM and over 1,000 CPU cores to power this Discord music bot, illustrating how popular the service had become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JUqjv"&gt;“I believe that now that we received the letter, all music bots will be getting them too in the following weeks and I strongly believe all of them will shut down,” explains Yoav. “As someone that was a very early user on Discord it’s hard to envision Discord without music bots, they’ve become key to the experience and bring so much fun and engagement to a community. It’s a sad end of an era here for everyone on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlEXfN"&gt;While music bots might feel like a core part of Discord, they have been enabled by third parties for years, allowing Discord to avoid scrutiny or legal action from companies like YouTube. Groovy and Rythm shutting down will force many Discord users to look for alternatives, but smaller bot developers could soon end up in a similar position if they attempt to fill the giant gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI3JEX"&gt;YouTube and Discord do appear to be working on some form of alternative, though. Discord has been testing a social party feature on its service for the past 10 months, and it allows Discord users to form a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;YouTube watch party&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a straight replacement for music bots on Discord, but if the feature ever officially launches then it will be an official way to watch YouTube content inside Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0P3KR"&gt;We’ve reached out to both Google and Discord to comment on the Rythm shutdown. Discord declined to comment, and Google did not respond by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnsZQ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th 5:30AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Discord’s decision not to comment, and more details on Rythm active user numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube halves the number of subscribers you need to unlock Community posting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-r2faR4seE0ngfxuIei2AYn0X_k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835552/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5RKur"&gt;YouTube is cutting the number of subscribers you need to be able to make Community posts in half, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d1b233e4-4ac2-41a0-abbb-8c3db9665bc8"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Starting October 12th, instead of requiring 1,000 subscribers, you’ll need more than 500 subscribers. In a tweet, YouTube said that will open up the feature to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057"&gt;“millions” more channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oFScVw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Community posts are coming to millions more channels!!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Starting October 12, 2021, we’re lowering the eligibility threshold for Community posts to channels with 500+ subscribers: &lt;a href="https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML"&gt;https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tips for getting started on the Community tab →&lt;a href="https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t"&gt;https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SB1pyfbgUz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SB1pyfbgUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2oeK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9409631?hl=en"&gt;Community posts&lt;/a&gt; are Facebook-like news or status updates from creators that can be found on a dedicated Community tab on their profile. Sometimes, you might also see them in the Home or Subscriptions tab. The feature was designed to replace the Discussion tab, which will be officially removed from all channels on October 12th, YouTube said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojwkra"&gt;For creators with fewer than 500 subscribers who want to use the Community posts feature, YouTube says it is “working to bring Community posts to you in the future,” suggesting that the feature could be rolled out more widely at some point. And once you do cross that 500-subscriber threshold, it might take up to a week until you can make Community posts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reports having 50 million Premium and Music subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzaIAY8Oia1QHvQViLMkC9FptGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810147/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GmTOIg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has 50 million users subscribed to or trying YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, which is a marked increase from the 30 million &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/google-earnings-antitrust-scrutiny/"&gt;subscribers it reported in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to mark a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;continued trend&lt;/a&gt; in people looking to make the jump from the free versions of YouTube and YouTube Music, even as more services are competing in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKGlus"&gt;Google doesn’t break down that 50 million number any further, so we don’t really know how many people are subscribed to YouTube Music or Premium and how many are using the services’ free one-month trial. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;its blog post&lt;/a&gt; spends a lot of time talking about music, hailing YouTube as the fastest-growing music-subscription service. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/youtube-music-passes-50-million-subscribers-up-20-million-in-less-than-a-year-1235054559/"&gt;compared Google’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; with other streaming services. It reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596155/spotify-earnings-q2-2021-podcasting-investments-acquisitions-subscribers"&gt;Spotify has around 165 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae722400-561c-431a-85eb-e09e1f6b0bb2"&gt;quotes estimates&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music having 78 million. (The last official word was in June 2019 when Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;its service had passed 60 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYHZDp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t really break down what that 50 million number means&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pb5Iww"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium"&gt;YouTube Music Premium&lt;/a&gt; costs $9.99 a month and lets users listen to and download ad-free music. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; goes for $11.99 a month and gives subscribers access to all of the benefits of YouTube Music, with the ability to also download and watch regular videos ad-free. Premium subscribers can also have videos play in the background while they’re using another app or their phone is locked. For those who spend a lot of time watching non-music content on the platform, that’s a much better experience for not that much more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H9q35"&gt;Google hasn’t commented on what caused the 20 million-subscriber increase, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind that last year’s count was reported right around the time when Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354136/google-play-music-shut-down-end-service-youtube-music-date"&gt;shutting down its Play Music service&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to tell how many people were subscribed to it — but both Google Play and YouTube Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537261/google-youtube-music-play-music-15-million-subscribers"&gt;reportedly had 15 million subscribers combined&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BsHjOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s clear a growing number of people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lz9bKq"&gt;Without knowing the breakdown, it’s hard to tell exactly what this means for Google. Were more people interested in letting videos play in the background without ads, or were they looking for an alternative or addition to Spotify and Apple Music? Taking a step back, it’s clear more people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings. While there have been plenty of (admittedly justified) complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;glut of video&lt;/a&gt; and audio streaming services, it seems there’s still room to grow, if Google is any example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TimTheTatman, one of Twitch’s biggest streamers, moves to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gamers’ Choice Awards 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbe3QsgVY4hozan7XjnrMVRJs0A=/1x132:1992x1459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804097/1077212614.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Bezjian/Getty Images for Gamers’ Choice Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjn1tr"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, is leaving &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. His move comes just days after another big streamer, Ben “DrLupo” Lupo, announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he’d be switching from Twitch to YouTube as well&lt;/a&gt;. Betar’s first stream will take place on September 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCusxz"&gt;In moving from Twitch, Betar is leaving behind &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman"&gt;the 7 million followers&lt;/a&gt; he’s accrued on the Amazon-owned platform. But he won’t be starting from scratch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/timthetatman"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where he already has 3.8 million subscribers. YouTube declined to comment on the terms of its deal with Betar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G63l7A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRaYM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/timthetatman-will-leave-twitch-for-youtube-2021-8"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Betar said the move will let him spend more time with his family. “When I started, I had no family obligations and I could [stream] a lot of hours,” he said to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “The reality is, now that I’ve got my wife and my son, it’s hard for me to stream as much as I did beforehand.” Lupo, in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/30/drlupo-twitch-youtube-exclusive-deal/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similarly indicated that his YouTube Gaming deal would give him more family time and said that the deal he was presented with would let him be “secure for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiaxD7"&gt;Betar and Lupo’s moves follow earlier switches made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; and signal that YouTube Gaming might be investing more in bringing big names to the platform. YouTube Gaming still sees far fewer hours watched than Twitch does, &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;according to Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, so the signings could help YouTube close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmSbGb"&gt;In an acknowledgment of the move, Twitch shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937"&gt;a montage of Betar on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, including the iconic moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376298/timthetatman-fall-guys-victory-win-finally-twitch-live"&gt;when he finally won a game of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tqrbby"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="yu1ORR"&gt;“It’s been great to see all that TimTheTatman has achieved since being partnered in 2012 on Twitch — whether it was marrying the love of his life and welcoming an heir to the Tatman throne, or the trials and tribulations of achieving his first Fall Guys crown,” a Twitch spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s been a pleasure being part of Tim’s community, and we are proud of everything he has done for gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrjvMO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 1st, 1:16PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that YouTube declined to comment on its deal with Betar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max and YouTube are now on Spectrum TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yYe3IWlOEY5tkKqF3AjjiOjOQI=/295x0:1210x610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794872/HBO_Max_in_Apps_Menu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spectrum TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T6a5MI"&gt;Two of the biggest players in streaming, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube, have officially arrived on Spectrum TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykoa4Y"&gt;It’s the first time the apps have been supported on Spectrum TV, Charter’s digital cable provider and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629518/spectrum-tv-app-roku-channel-store"&gt;live TV app&lt;/a&gt;, and users will be able to access content from both apps through the platform’s guide on channels 2004 for HBO Max and 2003 for YouTube. Users will also be able to find them by searching the guide or from the guide’s apps menu. (A subscription to HBO Max, which costs $10 per month with ads or $15 to go ad-free and unlock same-day theatrical releases, will still be required to access the content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjnVvu"&gt;The two apps are huge additions to Spectrum’s platform. &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which launched well over a year ago, offers more than 13,000 hours of premium content from brands that include HBO, DC, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, and Max Originals, among others. The service also made Warner Bros.’ entire 2021 film slate available on its premium tier the same day those films debut in theaters at no additional cost. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;controversial move&lt;/a&gt; and one that’s caused WarnerMedia quite a few headaches, it’s a tremendous value for anyone uncertain about returning to theaters just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFspw"&gt;A spokesperson noted that the guide channels offer an additional method for customers to access the HBO Max and YouTube apps. Together with Netflix, they’re the first three streaming apps to be accessible directly through the Spectrum Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMRGJ"&gt;“As the video landscape continues to change, we are evolving our products and making it easier for our customers to watch what they want by providing access to streaming apps from convenient launch points within the Spectrum TV experience,” Elena Ritchie, Spectrum’s group vice president of video experience, said in a statement. “We look forward to growing this library and expect to launch more streaming video apps in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DrLupo is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Off Court At The 2019 Australian Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veCQMEfVqzSvuTtWRbEluv9TszQ=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793846/1124891630.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt King / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cw4ys3"&gt;Streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo has signed a deal to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming, following in the footsteps of other well-known streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; in moving from Twitch to YouTube. Lupo’s first YouTube Gaming stream will take place on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64PoLQ"&gt;Lupo already has a sizable presence on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNF0LEQ2abMr0PAX3cfkAMg"&gt;with more than 1.7 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. But in switching to the Google-owned platform, he’s moving on from his large audience on Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drlupo"&gt;where he has 4.5 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIH1d"&gt;A Loaded PR representative declined to comment on the terms of Lupo’s YouTube Gaming deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;In December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lupo signed a deal with Twitch that was reported to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1204448185785208833"&gt;worth millions of dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;. The Amazon-owned streaming service acknowledged Lupo’s departure &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “we wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj1lqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a creator, a gamer and a father, you’re many things to many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrLupo&lt;/a&gt;, you’re someone who works hard to put good into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pkUCoX1dWe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pkUCoX1dWe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSDTjy"&gt;While big-name streamers aren’t signing splashy exclusivity deals quite as often as they used to in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ defection from Twitch to Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, that’s likely in part because Mixer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down by Microsoft in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the potential number of places to go is one platform fewer. (Blevins, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430767/ninja-twitch-homecoming-return-mixer-shroud"&gt;has returned to streaming exclusively on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V60daE"&gt;Both Dunlop and Hofstetter have seen success since moving exclusively to YouTube. However, Twitch sees vastly more hours watched than both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming combined, making up nearly 75 percent of total hours watched across all three platforms in the first quarter of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;Streamlabs report&lt;/a&gt;. That means Lupo may not see as much viewership on YouTube Gaming as he does on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuuqmiqAdW7tPWqmcx5C6neInFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814729/1_4lFFUZbSZuCWgetM2PbBng.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QByCTJ"&gt;But in signing this exclusivity deal, it seems Lupo sees opportunity with Google’s platform. And in a statement, he suggests the platform will also help him as he “expand[s] my brand through other entertainment initiatives,” so perhaps there’s more that YouTube is offering Lupo we just aren’t aware of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LdCB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 30th, 1:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google finally releases YouTube Music Wear OS app, but only for Samsung’s new watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KH0R9GpthaPAYFaSlyhFoFKVrtg=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776599/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZdESe"&gt;Google has finally released a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music"&gt;Wear OS app for YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;, which could seem like welcome news for people who have been waiting for a way to play their music off Google’s streaming service after the company shut down Google Play Music on Wear OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355887/google-play-music-wear-os-smartwatch-shut-down-youtube-music"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. But the new app comes with a few caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJf8JX"&gt;The biggest catch is that the new app only works on one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s two new watches&lt;/a&gt; powered by Wear OS 3, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765#zippy=%2Csmartwatches"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;. Those watches won’t be available until August 27th, so even if you want to try the new app right now, you won’t be able to unless you have a Galaxy Watch 4 or a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v72Yi2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if you have a compatible watch, it sounds like the app has some frustrating limitations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqvlUQ"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lucky enough to have one of the new watches, the YouTube Music Wear OS will let YouTube Premium subscribers download music right to their watch, meaning you can listen to tunes with just a watch and a pair of Bluetooth headphones, even when you don’t have an internet connection. However, based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/youtube-music-for-wear-os-hands-on/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s &lt;/em&gt;hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the app, it sounds like there might be some frustrating caveats you’ll have to keep in mind when you’re actually using the Wear OS YouTube Music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6BmNg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says there doesn’t appear to be a way to &lt;em&gt;stream&lt;/em&gt; music from the app — it appears that you can only download music right now. And annoyingly, you can only download songs while the watch is on a charger, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyPEyq"&gt;Still, it’s nice that a YouTube Music Wear OS app is available at all, even in its currently limited form. Google hasn’t shared details about when the app might be available on other Wear OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can now turn on picture-in-picture on iPhone — here’s how</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unpHc4LCFhB85ZFP2--7UePeWxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772479/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRhHTx"&gt;In June, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540482/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad-ios-app-free-premium"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be bringing picture-in-picture to iOS. Now, it seems the much-demanded feature is finally available, though perhaps for a limited time only and only for YouTube Premium subscribers currently. Here’s how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UifLlx"&gt;If you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, open up a web browser and head to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to where “Picture-in-picture on iOS” is listed and click “Try it out.” You’ll be prompted to sign in to your account. Then, while watching a YouTube video, just navigate away from the app using the home button or by swiping up and picture-in-picture will start. Locking your phone screen while watching PiP will pause the video, but you can resume it via the lock screen media controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIjZtyU48d6dZYFmAXgu6GpOa10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804321/IMG_FAC59AB82AD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Head to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to enable the experimental feature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDx7V"&gt;We spotted the news &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which notes that some users have been able to get the feature working on iPads as well as iPhones, but it seems access is a little unpredictable. (Apparently deleting the app might help.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5YpjS"&gt;YouTube says the feature is “Available until 31 Oct,” and we’re not sure what happens after this date. Fingers’ crossed that will be when YouTube — as promised in June — will be bringing the feature to all users, not just paid ones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A guide to platform fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyTj24P6kioSYNC-lI2mpiPCQGI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67438682/VRG_ILLO_4687_A_guide_to_platform_fees.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The hidden costs behind your favorite apps, games, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iNHwd8"&gt;Online marketplaces like Etsy and Apple’s App Store allow businesses to flourish by connecting them to huge, global audiences. But these marketplaces are big businesses themselves, and in order to earn a profit, they take a cut of revenue from many of the other companies that use their space. It leads to a constant tension: apps like Tinder and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be nearly the phenomena they are today without the App Store, but they have to constantly pay Apple for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOSXIP"&gt;Apps are just one example of how online platforms for small businesses and independent creators have shifted the world we live and work in. Membership platforms, like Patreon, allow creatives to charge monthly payments in exchange for new videos, comics, and essays. Video services like Twitch and YouTube allow creators to monetize their time through advertising revenue. And marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon allow people to sell an assortment of products directly to customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flZWs"&gt;The cut each platform takes varies significantly: Apple notoriously takes 30 percent of many digital in-app purchases; Twitch takes a 50 percent cut of subscription fees and a cut of advertising; eBay asks people to buy space and then pay a fee.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing just how much each platform takes is crucial to figuring out what’s best for your business, or for understanding how the businesses you’re shopping from make money. Here are the various fees each platform takes, divided into four categories: app stores, creator platforms (including memberships, video services, and more), digital marketplaces, and games marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="da0jpB"&gt;App stores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kzShWw"&gt;App stores are where an enormous number of businesses operate. Whether someone is selling a line of jewelry on Etsy or spending oodles of money in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, app stores are the gateway to reaching people who shop on their phones and computers. Approximately 80 percent of Americans shop online, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, and more than half of those shoppers use a mobile device like a phone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwHDdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple App Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYKQp1"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in App Store sales can receive 15 percent commission through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769807344&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0P0P5jBkjzYy3mt-xf5cP3"&gt;Apple’s App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjDxJ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foAtEv"&gt;Google takes 15 percent in fees on developers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;first $1 million in Play Store revenue&lt;/a&gt; every year. After the $1 million threshold, the rate goes back up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXAXaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission &lt;a href="https://seller.samsungapps.com/help/termsAndConditions.as"&gt;on purchases through the app store&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be negotiated with Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBcY1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon App Store: &lt;/strong&gt;30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases. Subscription commission is 20 percent on video apps and 30 percent on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjo4FI"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in app store revenue can receive a 20 percent commission and 10 percent in “promotional credits” for Amazon Web Services through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537726/amazon-app-store-cut-revenue-1-million-80-20-10"&gt;Amazon’s Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcVW3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 percent commission on apps and 12 percent commission on PC games starting August 1st, 2021. A 30 percent commission on all apps, games, and in-app purchases on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsmi77"&gt;Non-game sellers can also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769796035&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pcTZw9XK5Y0m1YuGgSipt"&gt;use their own payment system&lt;/a&gt; and avoid Microsoft’s commission entirely as of July 28th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qZw43L"&gt;Creator platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SgT0wL"&gt;While app stores largely fit into the logic of their real-life, physical counterparts, an ever-growing breed of creator platforms allows people to monetize their personality and creativity more directly. Whether glued on to an existing social network like Facebook or reinventing old forms of entertainment like Clubhouse, creator platforms have found familiar ways to earn a buck on the backs of creator popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kw9kde"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pUePjZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;three types of plans&lt;/a&gt; creators can enroll in, and each plan comes with a different cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aKTu7G"&gt;Lite plan: Patreon takes 5 percent &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdqpTH"&gt;Pro plan: Patreon takes 8 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="27Ahq9"&gt;Premium plan: Patreon takes 12 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMLwm"&gt;The tiers are geared toward different types of creators and businesses. The pro tier lets a creator offer tiered memberships to fans, while the premium tier provides a dedicated contact at Patreon who can provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7bsBU"&gt;Then, there are payment processing fees. For creators in the United States, Patreon takes 5 percent plus 10 cents for payments of $3 or less. Payments over $3 result in a 2.9 percent cut plus 30 cents going to Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g66UD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans: &lt;/strong&gt;OnlyFans takes 20 percent of subscription fees and other earnings, like tips. Creators can set their subscription fees between $5 and $50 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLgHH"&gt;Tips &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/2/14/55"&gt;max out at $100&lt;/a&gt; for new users and go up to $200 for users who have had an account for four months or longer. You can tip $500 per day as a new user, with the limit increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl0STG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: &lt;/strong&gt;Twitter offers an array of ways for creators to make money. Super Follows &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator#sfstatus"&gt;allows creators to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month in exchange for perks like exclusive tweets. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; allow creators to charge for access to live audio events, with ticket prices ranging anywhere from $1 to $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmwxFS"&gt;For both products, Twitter takes a 3 percent commission on payments (after payment processing and in-app purchase fees, such as Apple’s 30 percent cut) until creators earn their first $50,000 on the platform, after which Twitter takes 20 percent. The features are only available to select users for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fREbo7"&gt;Creators can also &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tip-jar"&gt;receive money directly&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter’s Tip Jar feature, which is currently in beta and only available to some users. Twitter doesn’t take a cut, but payments are subject to the processing fees of whatever third-party payment service is linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIGoN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/646162679132229?id=558489708108283"&gt;lets creators offer monthly Fan Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; and receive support directly from their followers. Facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut each month, but the company has announced it won’t be taking any fees until 2023. Apple and Google do take their typical cut on mobile, though, reducing creators’ share to 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpksF"&gt;Facebook also offers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172"&gt;a tipping feature for livestreams called Stars&lt;/a&gt; — basically its answer to Twitch’s Bits. Creators get 1 cent per star, but (like Twitch below) viewers buy them for more than a penny each. If a viewer is buying only a few dollars at a time, Facebook might take upward of 18 percent of the money spent on tips. Creators also need to meet &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/understand-monetization-eligibility-status"&gt;Facebook’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to enable Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhjJ7q"&gt;Bulletin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;Facebook’s newsletter product&lt;/a&gt;, currently doesn’t take a cut of subscriptions, though Facebook has so far limited the platform to a select group of higher-profile writers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tAXPLP"&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwLzwg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube: &lt;/strong&gt;Creators primarily make money on YouTube through ad revenue. YouTube takes 45 percent of revenue from ads and gives creators 55 percent, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtube-standardizes-ad-revenue-split-for-all-partners-but-offers-upside-potential-1200786223/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzLo7"&gt;YouTube also has a number of ways for creators to get paid directly by viewers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9MnA3"&gt;The platform lets channels offer memberships, which are &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9355861?p=cm_internationalpricing&amp;amp;visit_id=637360435699211837-3596854631&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;monthly subscriptions that run between $1 and $100&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePlvW1"&gt;Similar to several Twitch features, YouTube’s Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks features give fans the ability to tip creators in exchange for perks like better comment placement in a livestream chat, custom stickers, and animations. Prices range from $1 to $500 for pinned Super Chat comments, $1 to $50 for Super Stickers, and $2 to $50 for Super Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEWAAi"&gt;YouTube takes 30 percent of the revenue earned on memberships and Super features once taxes and applicable app store fees are deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtIxX"&gt;Creators can also sell merchandise from select retailers directly to subscribers via the merch shelf underneath videos. YouTube doesn’t take a cut of merch sales, but creators may be subject to different fees depending on which of the 31 different supported retailers they partner with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3CbSp"&gt;YouTube also shares revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions based on the amount subscribers watch a creator’s videos. The company has not disclosed how that money is divided, but YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; most of the revenue from Premium goes to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cvnha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch: &lt;/strong&gt;A creator can start making money from ads, subscriptions, and donations once they become a Twitch affiliate, which takes a certain amount of streaming and followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOlblB"&gt;Twitch typically takes 50 percent of subscription fees. Subscription pricing varies by country to reflect the local cost of living. As an example, a base subscription is $4.99 per month in the US but around $1.20 per month in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmXvX"&gt;Twitch also offers streamers a way to be paid via donations using a virtual currency called bits. Twitch pays creators 1 cent per bit, so after receiving 100 bits, a streamer gets $1. The catch is, viewers pay extra up front to buy those bits: 100 bits costs $1.40 to buy on the web, or around $2 to buy on mobile to account for app store fees. That means anywhere from 29 percent to 50 percent of money spent toward tipping is being lost to fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZwiB0"&gt;Streamers frequently accept donations through third-party payment platforms, too. Twitch doesn’t take a cut of these, but the platforms themselves may come with their own &lt;a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/twitch-donate-button-online-donations/"&gt;deductions for payment processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1J8T"&gt;On top of subscriber fees, streamers also earn ad revenue — usually around $3.50 for every 1,000 views of an ad on their channel. For both subscriptions and advertising, bigger streamers may get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BAgG9v"&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rnekUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse: &lt;/strong&gt; Live social audio app Clubhouse allows listeners &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/introducing-payments"&gt;to pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; via a “Send Money” button. Clubhouse doesn’t take a cut of the payments, and the person leaving the tip is asked to cover the payment processing fee from Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Z3Y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its subsidiary Anchor, Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;allows podcasters to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify won’t take a cut until 2023, after which the company will charge a 5 percent commission. Creators have to cover payment processing fees out of their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEvz7v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;Subscriptions in Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are subject to the same rules as other subscriptions on Apple platforms: there’s a 30 percent commission to start, but if subscribers stick around for a year, the commission drops to 15 percent. Creators also have to pay $19.99 per year to offer subscriptions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFQOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its live audio feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, Discord offers creators the ability to sell tickets to their audio events. The feature is currently in a limited beta, and Discord hasn’t announced if it will keep a portion of ticket sales or when the feature will be available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l1Hn6e"&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rsWmOU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr: &lt;/strong&gt;A subscription feature, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus&lt;/a&gt;, lets creators offer subscriber-only posts for $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month. Tumblr takes a 5 percent commission on subscription fees, and for subscriptions made through iOS or Android, creators will lose an additional 30 percent to the respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L56CvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack: &lt;/strong&gt;The newsletter platform takes &lt;a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost-"&gt;10 percent of subscription fees&lt;/a&gt;. Substack lets writers choose how much they want to charge newsletter subscribers per month or year. (There’s also a free tier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHh9N7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wattpad: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiction publishing platform Wattpad offers a limited form of monetization for certain creators. &lt;a href="https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022692911-Paid-Stories-Program"&gt;Invite-only Paid Stories&lt;/a&gt; allows fans to purchase coins to unlock entries in an ongoing story or novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ARgg"&gt;Currently, Wattpad sells coins in several different packages (you can get nine coins for 99 cents, for example) and chapters are usually priced at three coins each (though some go for more). Wattpad says writers receive the “majority of the revenue from the program,” but it has not publicly disclosed the exact split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tas7Ql"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Vella: &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon has its own take on Wattpad’s Paid Stories, &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G5TFR9WSHB46ZKFN"&gt;called Kindle Vella&lt;/a&gt;. Writers who publish with Vella receive royalties based on the number of tokens spent on an “episode” in their story, with token cost determined by the episode’s length (one token per 100 words). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFCNQ"&gt;Writers get to keep half of whatever a reader spent on the tokens they used to unlock their story, minus taxes and fees. The complicating factor is that Amazon offers tokens at different price points — you can buy 200 tokens for $1.99 or 1,100 tokens for $9.99 — so payouts can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq6k84"&gt;At those price points, for example, a writer who receives 100 tokens would either get $1 or 90 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dvhlsk"&gt;Digital marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aekChA"&gt;Digital marketplaces for physical goods are at the core of online shopping. Many of us use Amazon on a daily or weekly basis, or peruse eBay at work to keep an eye on the latest auctions. But while large businesses can be built on these platforms, their terms can be complicated to navigate and tend to ensure the platforms make a cut on just about every sale that goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9l9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook collects either 5 percent per shipment of products sold (one order can include multiple shipments if items are mailed separately), or a flat fee of 40 cents for shipments of $8 or less. This covers taxes, payment processing fees, and applies to all checkout transactions on both Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYoJCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412"&gt;Facebook is waiving the selling fee&lt;/a&gt; for all orders shipping through June 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWvS6P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is a complicated one. First, &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_wic_n#selling-plans"&gt;businesses can choose&lt;/a&gt; between using a professional selling plan, which costs $39.99 a month, or an individual seller’s plan, which has no monthly fee. Those on the professional tier do not have to pay a sales fee on items sold, while those on an individual seller’s plan pay $1 per sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Jqm4G"&gt;Amazon then takes a commission on each sale, including shipping fees. This fee depends on what the item is, typically ranging from 8 to 20 percent. There’s also a $1.80 closing fee for products listed under media categories, including books, DVDs, music, game consoles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGMlxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy:&lt;/strong&gt; Etsy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsell%3Fref%3Dftr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charges a 20-cent fee&lt;/a&gt; for people to list each item for sale. Then, for every product sold, Etsy takes a 5 percent transaction fee, and a payment processing fee of 3 percent plus 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FDHHi"&gt;The company also runs an advertising program that’s somewhat controversial with sellers. Etsy pays to advertise their products on sites like Google, and then takes up to a 15 percent fee (but no more than $100) if they lead to a sale. Small sellers can opt out, but larger sellers have to participate; for them, Etsy only takes a 12 percent referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDJv8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay sellers might pay a small fee&lt;/a&gt; to list a product and a 12.5 percent commission on the sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIY9Z"&gt;Fees can vary significantly depending on product category and listing type, though. eBay also offers paid premium store features that can reduce fees. It’s a fairly complicated series of options — you can get a sense of some possibilities for paying stores from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/run-your-store/subscriptions-and-fees.html#m22_tb_a2__2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21209964__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="8EauQs"&gt;Games marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="im3fHn"&gt;From a single developer to a huge studio, being on Steam or in the PlayStation store is a big deal for distribution. These giant marketplaces are also key businesses for the companies that run them, often meaning steep fees on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjp36I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam takes &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838?content_only=true"&gt;30 percent of all sales&lt;/a&gt; made until the first $10 million. That cut becomes 25 percent when a developer sells between $10 million and $50 million. For every sale after the first $50 million, Steam only takes a 20 percent cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No2ULR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic takes 12 percent of the revenue from all games sold, giving developers 88 percent. Epic CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1120441795010338816?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that of the 12 percent Epic collects, the company nets about 5 percent as profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtIZnS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlayStation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reported to take a 30 percent cut from games sold in the PlayStation Store, though the split isn’t publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvkLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b"&gt;takes a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from all games and in-game purchases sold through the console’s store under its standard developer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMZpzT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch.io&lt;/strong&gt;: Itch.io takes &lt;a href="https://itch.io/updates/introducing-open-revenue-sharing"&gt;a radical approach&lt;/a&gt; to how it handles its revenue share with its independent creators. By default, the platform takes 10 percent of each transaction before payment providers take their cut. But if creators choose, as part of Itch’s open revenue sharing, they can lower that cut to zero or raise it to as high as 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nofJy8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 2021, 9AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published in September 2020; it has been updated and expanded for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPIkG5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
