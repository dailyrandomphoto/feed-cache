    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Inside the massive fandom making Dream SMP YouTube’s biggest hit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SlqBt7"&gt;Ollie was asleep at three in the morning when the Discord app on his phone started blowing up. He panicked; many of his friends lived in different time zones, but they knew how late it was for him. The only reason they’d be frantically messaging him in the middle of the night is if something terrible happened. Bolting awake, he checked his messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTa41R"&gt;“OLLIE, DREAM JUST GAVE YOU A SHOUTOUT ON TWITTER!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBXFkZ"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;DREAM SHOUTED YOU OUT!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ugEkJ"&gt;A high school student and artist, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; spends much of his free time making fan art about his favorite &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;streamers. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt/status/1371667657926189061"&gt;one illustration&lt;/a&gt;, he shows his favorite creator, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamTraps"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt;, with a green-and-black hoodie, black nail polish on his fingers, and messy black hair — something Ollie had to invent since &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82kJDVvtgok"&gt;no one has ever seen Dream’s face&lt;/a&gt;. Dream, arguably the main character in his &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;universe, known as Dream SMP, has more than 2.7 million followers on Twitter and nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube. So when Ollie saw Dream tell his followers to check out the art on his account, Ollie burst into tears. His own Twitter account went from around 8,000 followers to more than 13,000 followers in one night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wI9X82"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzD772"&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community,” Ollie told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over Discord. “Not because of the numbers that were coming through with the shoutout, but because of how many people I realized were around me, supporting me, and being such amazing friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9xtGg"&gt;Describing the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minecraft-dream-smp-political-drama/"&gt;story of Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt; to anyone not paying attention to every stream or YouTube upload can sound like a made-up language. Dream SMP (SMP stands for “survival multiplayer,” a type of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server) was&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;created by a YouTuber who goes by Dream. Over the last 18 months, Dream has invited other Twitch streamers and YouTube personalities — including TommyInnit, Tubbo, GeorgeNotFound, Punz, and several more — to join in. Together, they get into hijinxes, stage lengthy feuds, and pal around for a combined audience of tens of millions of people. Dream went from 1 million to 15 million subscribers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream/status/1344315641298366464"&gt;in one year alone&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is scripted and planned out, driving a larger story, but many of the reactions and circumstances are totally improvised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2nXIfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5R5uGG"&gt;Like a television show or cinematic universe, Dream SMP found its audience through a series of never-ending epic battles. The “Disc Saga” played &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPvdw7bOak&amp;amp;list=PL90zg3iCjs9LGwQ4DGNL2lfuPKIul4ApO"&gt;out over countless hours&lt;/a&gt;, turning a game of capture the flag (essentially) into a dramatic tale of good versus evil, as Dream and TommyInnit fought for dominance of the server. Once Wilbur Soot, a 24-year-old YouTuber from Britain and one of the main Dream SMP writers, joined in, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYTqgKWCuF0"&gt;he set up L’Manberg&lt;/a&gt; and created a space for a specific batch of creators. This eventually led to an all-out battle for independence with Dream that enraptured YouTube’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;audience. On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing, but it’s also the tiny, funny, and sweet moments that transform each streamer into a character worth rooting for — not unlike comic book heroes and villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLVUnP"&gt;The only thing more impressive than the elaborate world they’ve created is the fan base that’s sprung up around it. Dream SMP fanfiction writers dominate websites like Archive of Our Own, Dream SMP fan art can be found all over Tumblr and Twitter, and Dream SMP fan songs (including an entire in-the-works musical) get uploaded to YouTube. There is also a plethora of clip accounts that track Dream SMP stories for people who can’t tune in to each stream, full-blown fan-made animated episodes paying tribute to Dream SMP’s ongoing stories that air weekly on YouTube, and even a 24/7 news network devoted to tracking the universe’s story and hijinks. Dream SMP may exist on a tiny &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server, but thanks to a fan network stretching across the globe, it’s become a worldwide phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="HyFFHG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSoJshduVNo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eniGpc"&gt;Being a member of the Dream SMP community can sometimes feel like a full-time job. For Evan, it’s practically become one. At 16, he juggles attending school and working on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1mxOwASgWGYkvxN20-MBw"&gt;documentary-style videos for his channel&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each video is designed to provide an entertaining and accurate summary of the various lore that comes out of Dream SMP storylines, and a growing audience tunes in. Evan has nearly 400,000 subscribers, and his Dream SMP videos collect millions of views. Those videos can take Evan more than a month to complete; his last video took more than 120 hours alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEXoCK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Homework is essentially keeping me from working”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpLVyO"&gt;“I’m trying to balance videos and homework right now, but it’s weird because I find myself having to work on homework even when the videos make me significantly more money,” Evan told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on a phone call one night. “Obviously, I’m not making anything from school — I wish we got paid to go to school — but it’s like homework is essentially keeping me from working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1owFkz"&gt;Since the Dream SMP lore is constantly growing, a big part of Evan’s job is trying to piece it all together for newcomers who find his videos, hoping to catch up. In one video, Evan tries to keep track of each time Tommy and Dream stole discs (think CD-ROMs with music on them) from each other and hid said discs far within the block earth that makes up a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server. Evan makes it easy to follow, hitting just the right dramatic notes as the story progresses, but he says the work can be exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzLQB7"&gt;As Evan describes it, trying to summarize Dream SMP plots in the simplest way possible is like “trying to explain a movie to someone who’s never seen a movie before.” Evan has also run into newfound challenges that make the job harder. When the Dream SMP creators started streaming more on Twitch, it became more difficult to track down videos to watch after the fact. He, too, has to rely on WikiGuides from devoted fans and popular clips on Reddit to figure out what video he should focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Ollie’s depictions of Dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kbiaor"&gt;“The toughest parts to understand are what’s happening now,” Evan said. “Now, there will be points where there will be multiple streams happening at the exact same time, and both of them have really important stuff being added to the main story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5K8zs"&gt;With the Dream SMP creators posting fewer YouTube videos and documentarians like Evan taking additional time to get the videos just right, a need has developed for daily updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwLCpV"&gt;Sam, Claire, Kenzie, Mae, Alex, Lilja, and Boston make up a group of mostly teens who run &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate"&gt;DreamSMP Updates&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter account dedicated to updating fans on “who’s live, who’s on each other’s streams, when the members release something, an explanation on the storyline for when people miss live streams,” and more. Basically, it’s a one-stop shop for anyone looking to find up-to-the-minute information about their favorite streamers or check in on the big things that happened on stream if they weren’t able to watch. Sam started it in December, asking friends she met through the community to help out with the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0FOlVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a lot of responsibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bb6xBM"&gt;The group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over a Discord chat that it takes some coordination, but they’ve gotten to the point over the last several months where everyone knows what their role is within the team. It’s a huge responsibility, one that every member takes on without asking for any kind of payment in return. People expect everything to be right 100 percent of the time, Claire said, adding, “We have a lot of responsibility to be the person that people need.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZHd2Q"&gt;Work is divided into sections (often grouped by platforms), and those can change day to day, Alex said. Someone handles keeping up with YouTube uploads, merchandise updates from each creator, ensuring the Twitch bot doesn’t flail when streamers go live, keeping fans updated with creator appearances in separate streamers, etc. Claire and Boston mostly handle tweeting explanations of what happened on the stream and how it pertains to ongoing lore. (“Puffy says she does believe Dream is wrong, that its good he’s in Prison, that he deserves the punishment,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate/status/1371324394174222337"&gt;one recent update reads&lt;/a&gt;.) Boston keeps an eye on what’s happening, tweeting updates when needed, while also jotting down live notes about every new lore development. It’s a complicated operation — one the team does because of their love for Dream SMP creators and the community in which they found one another as friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYSZa3"&gt;“One of my favorite things to do on the account is look at DMs and talk to people in DMs,” Kenzie said. “When I see people thanking us for the account, it makes me feel good that I’m helping people out and doing something for the community. That’s probably what motivates me to continue running the account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="CYf4xg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh4E1VB0iS4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aV6o0m"&gt;Even after the &lt;a href="https://dreamteam.fandom.com/wiki/Category:SMP_members"&gt;30 or so Dream SMP members&lt;/a&gt; have signed off, fans keep expanding its world. Archive of Our Own, one of the biggest fanfiction sites, is home to &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Video%20Blogging%20RPF/works"&gt;nearly 106,000 works&lt;/a&gt; listed under Video Blogging RPF (fanfiction about real streamers and vloggers). The biggest fandom under that umbrella is &lt;em&gt;Minecraft. &lt;/em&gt;Wattpad has just under 34,000 works listed under “Dream SMP,” and Tumblr is full of many more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HTnwM"&gt;At one point, fans of the saga “Heat Waves,” one of the most viral Dream SMP fan stories, thought they crashed Archive of Our Own when rushing to read a new chapter. The site’s downtime was just a coincidence, but “Heat Waves” at the time was the “third most kudosed fic on the site,” an administrator told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Adi Robertson. (Kudos are equivalent to a like on Facebook.) The story became so popular that the Glass Animals song “Heat Waves,” which inspired the name of the story, crept into the Hottest 100 tracks in Australia last year, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/hottest-100-win-glass-animals-heat-waves-feature-minecraft-fic/13086032"&gt;partially thanks to the fanfiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kSMHoJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Dream SMP narrative isn’t fan service; it’s “collaborative storytelling”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhPpCr"&gt;What’s helped to propel that community is the way Dream SMP has incorporated it into the stories that actually play out on their server. During one arc, fans started using the phrase “welcome home, Theseus” in their art, essays, and songs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJPvgIMqPYo"&gt;comparing Tommy to the Greek hero&lt;/a&gt; who was exiled. Eventually, the Dream SMP streamer Technoblade actually used the line. “I screamed so loudly I probably did permanent damage to the hearing of the brother sitting next to me,” as one fan, who goes by Teahound, &lt;a href="https://tea-with-veth.tumblr.com/post/637703569706008576/so-technoblade-said-welcome-home-theseus-and-i"&gt;wrote on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO5i12"&gt;“I decided to write about how the Dream SMP is a brilliant example of how to do fan service properly,” Teahound continued. “But actually, what is happening on the SMP cannot be described as fanservice. It’s collaborative storytelling in it’s best form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBhRvu"&gt;The community wouldn’t continue to thrive if there wasn’t a plethora of fans celebrating and boosting people’s work.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Usually, big fandoms are kind of toxic in some aspects. But this community genuinely respects the content creators, and we all genuinely support each other,” Ali Tyler, a college student who has helped create an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjx0jDUp8lkhS7-Y0PZDwCw"&gt;entire musical based on the Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt;, said in a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NE5zfu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOcNHB"&gt;Fan creations are mostly positive, but there are more controversial sectors where critics argue a line is crossed. Because the streamers are real people, the stories have faced criticism for sexual depictions of everyday people. “Heat Waves” focuses on Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two prominent members of the Dream SMP world, as they dance around their feelings for each other. In real life, they’re just good friends. But in fanfiction, they often become much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCRym"&gt;The majority of writers contributing to the Dream SMP fanfiction community “hate to see real people’s boundaries being crossed as well,” says Xetera, who writes real-person fiction within the Dream SMP universe. Newer writers “tend to ask for forgiveness rather than permission,” and that’s something the community tries to push back against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vxy5J"&gt;“I believe people fight over boundaries more than trying to listen when creators speak,” Xetera said over Discord, noting that “when people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT688e"&gt;At the center of all of these stories — the artists, writers, YouTube editors, and musical producers — is the community. Beyond the creators they watch, it’s the friends they make, feeling like they’re a part of this rapidly expanding and immersive moment in internet culture. It’s a world all their own, and they want to contribute their little section to the overarching narrative in any way that they can. For Ollie, the first artist that Dream ever gave a shoutout to on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream__Fanart/status/1347874095485104129"&gt;from his dedicated Dream fan art account&lt;/a&gt; and who wants to pay it forward by giving new artists their chance in the spotlight, that’s everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Dh21T6"&gt;“If it weren’t for the community that we’ve built, the Dream SMP wouldn’t have the same charm that it does,” Ollie said. “And I think the creators know that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE558s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKEg89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MatPat looks at YouTube’s biggest changes over the last decade — and what lies ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvXGQanwptuwOgOzAzx9tzscYMQ=/360x0:4248x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992875/MatPat_headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An interview with one of gaming’s longest-standing personalities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MYWjNx"&gt;Matthew &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameTheorists/videos"&gt;“MatPat”&lt;/a&gt; Patrick was on YouTube for two years before he hit publish on the first entry in the series that changed his life — and YouTube culture as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNJwRl"&gt;“Game Theory,” a series that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Med6Z8-9g"&gt;examines the ins and outs&lt;/a&gt; of popular video game franchises like &lt;em&gt;Five Nights at Freddy’s &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, premiered on April 18th, 2011. The channel quickly found an audience of gaming enthusiasts and industry developers who wanted to learn the secrets behind why certain games became such a hit. YouTubers also looked to him as a model, as Patrick successfully helped to pilot an entire genre of videos, using tricks he had learned while working behind the scenes at a multichannel network (an older YouTube model that has slowly faded away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSlhGp"&gt;Throughout the years, MatPat’s channel became a go-to open secret for new YouTube creators and game developers. He was one of the first creators to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996849/minecraft-youtube-rewind-fortnite-grand-theft-auto-roblox-biggest-games-views"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was so successful on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example. By 2017, he became a leading figure within the community, fighting on behalf of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators"&gt;YouTubers during the “adpocalypse.”&lt;/a&gt; He even went on to host an interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ap6PTQUMf4"&gt;session with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki&lt;/a&gt; about creator issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJyfMQ"&gt;In 2014,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Patrick expanded “Game Theory” into a franchise &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmTheorists"&gt;with “Film Theory,”&lt;/a&gt; and “Food Theory” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYoe8kQ-7Gn9ASOlmI0k6Q"&gt;followed just last year&lt;/a&gt;. His videos routinely pick up millions of views, and he employs a full team to help with editing and creating new episodes. Alongside his wife and channel partner Stephanie, the two are also exploring more charity live streams for causes close to their hearts. In December 2020, one of their charity streams &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2020-fundraising-news/game-theory-raises-3-million-on-youtube.html"&gt;raised more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMi2nN"&gt;With the 10th anniversary of Game Theory approaching, Patrick sat down with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for an interview about what’s changed on YouTube over the last decade and what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy4waT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wqb5zi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9BNqktRdLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="9hmIxS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question, which is maybe a big one, but in these last 10 years, what’s the biggest thing that has changed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unqf8s"&gt;Oh, well! [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] It’s pretty massive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNtZVL"&gt;I think the biggest stuff is the idea of being a YouTuber, and being a creator, has fundamentally shaped so much of entertainment, of being a storyteller — of the world ecosystem, in a lot of cases. The idea that anyone with a phone in their hand can not just create something but find an audience somewhere in the millions or tens of millions, and ultimately build a business off of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys1gbR"&gt;That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform. You’re giving rise to stories like the Dream SMP, which no television producer in their right mind would ever think to greenlight or understand why it could be so popular — and yet, it’s the biggest thing happening on YouTube right now. That sort of fostering of creativity, that explosion of being able to tell your own story is really exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsCcAT"&gt;You see those ripple effects happening, too. In the way that the lead shows, especially during COVID, had to film at home and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21179793/coronavirus-late-night-fallon-colbert-wwe-morning-shows-the-view-sports-premier-league-nba-mlb"&gt;become vloggers in their own right&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming has permeated the sports world in a way that 10 years ago would have never existed. Even the evolution of live content, as celebrities kind of tried to try to find their own audiences outside of their individual projects... they’re following the models that YouTubers and digital creators have been pioneering over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMImnV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You inspired a lot of people to kind of figure out a way to do those types of videos [theories and in-depth explainers] that are really influential and informative. When did you start noticing, like, “Ah, this thing I created is taking off to the point that people want to replicate it?” Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2A2nQ"&gt;We were one of the early video essay formats. From the YouTube creator standpoint, I think it was probably about three years into us doing the show that I first started to really take note that other people were attempting the format. I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce3"&gt;think it was VSauce3&lt;/a&gt;, the pop culture science channel, which was massive at the time. I remember thinking, “Oh, that’s my format. And they’re doing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVqCUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ow5n5r"&gt;That was also the first time that I got really scared. We were still in relatively early days, still finding our audience, and here’s this massive channel that is doing roughly the thing that we’ve been doing for the past three years — hopefully they don’t run us out or whatever. But what we came to learn very quickly was there’s an audience that is big enough for everyone, and everyone kind of tackles that theorizing format in their own unique voice, which is really exciting. You now have a community of theorists all applying their logic in different ways and can create complimentary content, as opposed to content that cannibalizes each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="130T7c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a different version of 2021, if Game Theory didn’t exist, if someone were to come to you and say, “I have this idea for this channel I want to do,” would that be able to find an audience today? Is there room for Game Theory today or is that something that had to happen at the moment it did?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV3pE0"&gt;It sounds a little bit defeatist, but I think it had to kind of happen when it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az1BYZ"&gt;The nature of theorizing does not work well with the modern ecosystem of digital video. Having thoughtful analytical pieces that take a week to put together like our videos doesn’t run with the speed that the internet runs with at this point. Doing this sort of research piece, it’s just hard to do. And you see that too even with educational channels in the space, right? The channels that have been able to survive in 2020 / 2021 are the established ones: the VSauces of the world, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicswoman"&gt;Physics Girls of the world&lt;/a&gt;. These channels that can afford to have a little bit of a delay between their uploads because their audience is already there. That affords them the time to do the research, to do the scripting, to make sure that their facts are correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzhhZP"&gt;If you’re looking to kind of get some sort of accelerated growth on the platform, that requires a faster cadence of uploads or being able to more closely ride trends. A single creator, doing all the steps on their own, would really struggle to do all of it in the time it takes to be competitive in that landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfFf69N4dKdcN4h1ihadq9g9HfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380163/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.52.33_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N98AHi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the future of gaming videos? Is it more Dream SMP stuff? Or is there a place where people can still do let’s plays and all that with games when YouTube is trying to figure out how to keep advertising going and keep the children’s privacy law COPPA in mind? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKq3VD"&gt;Gaming is stronger than it’s ever been. In 2020, gaming was one of the few fields that didn’t just sustain itself but thrived as more people found gaming to fill in the gaps that the disappearance of reality kind of left in its wake. A lot of people had these gaps in their schedules, gaps in social calendars, and gaming was able to kind of fill those holes. People were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200972/college-students-graduation-minecraft-coronavirus-school-closures"&gt;having graduations in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people were going to the museum in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. Gaming kind of exploded in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mviDZx"&gt;I think Dream SMP is definitely one route. It’s not just gaming, it’s narrative storytelling through the lens of gaming. You’re starting to see more people kind of adopt that Machinima idea of, “Hey, here’s a world in which I can treat this not as a game, but as a platform.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is doing it a lot of ways to where they have the creative block where you can create whatever you want. That’s really cool. Game developers are recognizing that the game doesn’t end when a player beats it or when the match ends, but it can become an ecosystem, a platform of its own to foster the creativity of its players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="499XjQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has always had that. That’s one of the reasons why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has had such staying power. You’re seeing other gaming companies recognizing this and trying to build in that direction. I can see that being the direction of where gaming content moves from here. It’s less about sitting down on the couch and playing through this narrative story time together, and more sitting down on the couch and creating a world together using the tools of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge1Dg6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like the term “YouTuber” now comes with more authority and more respect than it did in 2011? From your perspective, as someone who is an entrepreneur as well as a creator, how have those conversations changed with industry people that you meet when you say, “I’m on YouTube, I’m a YouTuber?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J1rCA"&gt;I think, for a long time, there was this kind of an attempt to educate traditional media about that exact issue. That being a YouTuber wasn’t a dirty word, right? There is a specific connotation attached to that, like a certain tier of creator — an upper tier of creator who is delivering this interesting content. But I think a lot of times, myself included, we got frustrated that a lot of times those conversations tended to fall on deaf ears. The learning process was slower than we hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl3Lwl"&gt;Nowadays, in 2021, it’s one of those things where there’s a division of people who get it and people who don’t. Rather than trying to prove credibility to the people who don’t, the industry is just moving forward. You either get it or you don’t. This is where there is still a division in the ecosystem, people who still don’t respect it or who still kind of look down on the title of YouTuber. But the need to kind of prove that legitimacy has kind of faded away. There’s enough critical movement in the ecosystem, in the traditional space, in the brand space, that it’s like I will find the people who understand me and respect me and move forward with them. If you don’t hop on the train, well, you’re just gonna get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoWt6e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I often think about not just how much has changed since 2011, but things that I miss from that era. There was a moment of true experimentation for an online video platform. I miss that. There are other things that I don’t miss. It was chaotic, and not always in a good way. Is there anything that you miss about that specific era? And is there anything from that specific era of YouTube that has kind of gone away that you’re happy about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWQjJV"&gt;In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West. You were able to kind of produce videos on any game, any topic, and there wasn’t a pressure for that upload to perform or there wasn’t an expectation of earning money off of it. You did get a lot of really interesting, really off-the-wall experimental videos that were true expressions of a person’s creativity and you saw stuff unlike anything you would see elsewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TUpkE"&gt;The window of what is acceptable to put on YouTube has really narrowed. You have regulations on one side dictating what isn’t kids’ content, you have rampant demonetization dictating what can or can’t be said or shown in a particular video. There is a certain level of polish that modern YouTube kind of expects of videos for them to kind of get a decent amount of traction on the platform. You lose a lot of the rawness — the bad cameras, the wonky editing, the YouTube slideshows of yesteryear — because the platform does have a standard of quality now that it’s looking to show to audiences around the world. And I understand why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmCyoi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZSCsI"&gt;But something does get lost for small creators who are still using this as a platform to kind of find their voice, find their audience. I definitely miss that. I miss that idea of community, that idea of anything goes, that idea of chaos. It’s a double-edged sword. As we talked about before, what it means to be a YouTuber is less stigmatized, there is a group of people who understand it. So the ability to build a business on YouTube on one hand is kind of a bummer because it’s no longer one person in the Wild West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tyot3"&gt;Now at the very least, I have stability. We’re going on 10 years, and I think for the first five of them, we operated under the motto that this bubble could burst at that moment. The algorithm could shift, advertisers could leave, YouTube could get shut down. Now, YouTube, the ecosystem, how it’s perceived in the world has evolved in such a way that this is a more stable place to build a business. Advertisers come and go, and you will have your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231561/youtube-child-exploitation-predators-controversy-creators-adpocalypse"&gt;occasional adpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, but the system has matured in such a way that paranoia of always having to look over your shoulder has started to ebb away a little bit, and you’re able to focus on running your own race and making the stuff that you are able to produce as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQR54O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is something that you’ve seen go around, assumptions that people make, that people actually get wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihJBcA"&gt;There’s a stigma that comes with anyone who’s kind of built out their team and has been public about it. The idea of, “Oh, this isn’t your channel anymore because you have an editor and a researcher, or you have someone who helps you upload the videos.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrCWY"&gt;What’s exciting to me is that it allows us to do what we love to do at a larger scale and actually stay relevant in 2021 with the kind of faster pace that YouTube expects at this point. Not only that, but also employ like-minded individuals who also are creative and have something that they want to say, or who are theorists like me, who have their own properties that they want to talk about. What a lot of people see is, “Oh, you became corporate” or we became a business. Yeah, we became a business, but that doesn’t lose the core of the creativity that brought us here in the first place. In fact, it’s enabled us to empower other creatives like ourselves to find employment doing the stuff that they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAG4r3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, last question, and it might be a little tougher. What’s next for you? Is there a future beyond YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxv0sb"&gt;We just launched Food Theory, and that’s been a lot of fun. That’s been really creatively refreshing for us. You can theorize about things that don’t just exist in the pop culture lexicon, you can theorize about anything in your day-to-day life. We have some thoughts as to what else you can theorize about, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that one fill in at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7cwe"&gt;Our main focus now is doing exactly what we talked about: being an influencer of influencers where we are trying to advocate to YouTube on behalf of creators’ rights and needs. We’re trying to find solutions for channels that are having trouble with monetization, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;having trouble with COPPA&lt;/a&gt; or things like that to try and help them be able to find the stability that we’ve been able to find. Finding business solutions and creator solutions that work for this kind of next generation of creators. We’ve been really working behind the scenes to make those tools available to creators so that way they can grow their own businesses faster and not have to make mistakes that we made along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s8PwKS"&gt;The last thing is our charitable work. At the end of last year, we had the amazing ability to raise $3 million for St. Jude along with the help of 50 of our favorite creators across various platforms. We see the importance of using the platform that we’ve been given, that we’re lucky enough to have built over the years, for good. If we can kind of pay it forward and pass along that goodwill and serve as an ambassador for worthwhile causes in order to inspire the next generation of creators to make good use of the fortunate position they’ve been given, that’s great as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UYEt0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTx5Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inexplicably, YouTube says extremely racist Steven Crowder video isn’t hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJh317FmJaD6VnJbs6fRqG6_8ps=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68991001/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.38.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMiIyo"&gt;YouTube removed an extremely racist video from conservative commentator Steven Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336028/youtube-steven-crowder-racist-video-removed-covid-misinformation-policies"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, citing violations of the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy — not its hate speech policy — as the reason for the removal. Inexplicably, though, the video did not violate the company’s hate speech policies at all, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/youtube-explains-why-a-racist-video-didnt-violate-its-hate-speech-rules-3d74befde097"&gt;the company told &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, despite Crowder and his co-hosts making numerous racist comments about Black farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5i4jZ"&gt;“Our hate speech policy prohibits content promoting hatred against groups based on their race,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;. “While offensive, this video from the Steven Crowder channel does not violate this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2R1pw"&gt;If you were curious, here is &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en"&gt;YouTube’s full hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to hear the offensive comments from Crowder’s show, &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt; clipped them in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. I will warn you that they are awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGsF9f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On YouTube, Steven Crowder and his co-hosts go on a wildly racist tirade against Black farmers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch"&gt;https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iUsm2hjknb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iUsm2hjknb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQNDpd"&gt;This means YouTube has a ridiculously high bar for hate speech, as &lt;em&gt;OneZero’s&lt;/em&gt; Will Oremus points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="e864"&gt;You’re free to mock, caricature, and belittle people based on their race, just as long as you don’t come right out and say you literally hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2TH1sT"&gt;While you could argue that YouTube’s just enforcing the policies it has, not the policies you might want, remember that YouTube has the ability to change those policies whenever it likes. That’s what it did &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-ongoing-work-to-tackle-hate"&gt;nearly two years ago in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, updating its hate speech policy “by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities” including race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fUiQU"&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;mean that hate speech doesn’t have to rise to the level of “promoting hatred” (the language YouTube used to &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;) to result in a policy violation, or to stop promoting Crowder as a YouTube Partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27XT0F"&gt;Speaking of which, YouTube &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; said in that 2019 post that it would take action on hate speech that comes “right up to the line” as well, warning that “Channels that repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies will be suspended from the YouTube Partner program.” In 2020, after Crowder’s YouTube Partner status was originally reinstated, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it would “take appropriate action” if there were more violations on his channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BMPCr"&gt;What will it take now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hUzYUt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube decides that homophobic harassment does not violate its policies","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653088/youtube-steven-crowder-carlos-maza-harassment-bullying-enforcement-verdict"},{"title":"YouTube will let Steven Crowder run ads after year-long suspension for harassment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing letting you watch YouTube videos right from a tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IL59lRqy4HDmmpBmmv5olUettGg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988808/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJmY3p"&gt;Twitter is testing a way to let you watch YouTube videos right from your timeline. Typically, when someone includes a YouTube link in a tweet, clicking that link sends you to YouTube, which can be frustrating if you didn’t want to leave Twitter to watch the video. This new feature, which is in testing today on iOS, means you won’t be sent away from Twitter, which will make it easier to watch a video and then keep on scrolling if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfBmko"&gt;Twitter shared how the feature works &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381"&gt;in a GIF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wn3Xrw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today on iOS, we’re testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly in your Home timeline, without leaving the conversation on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/V4qzMJMEBs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V4qzMJMEBs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mrJuHw"&gt;The test will be available to “a very small group of users” in Canada, the US, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, Twitter said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rA80x"&gt;“The current test on iOS will be a four-week experiment,” a Twitter spokesperson said. We plan to take a look at the results and will scale accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4bRVr"&gt;This new test arrives alongside two others announced last week for iOS and Android that are intended to improve sharing and viewing media on the social network. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;One test&lt;/a&gt; adds a “what you see is what you get” image preview in the tweet composer, meaning images appear in your timeline as they do when you’re drafting a tweet. The company is also testing ways to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940"&gt;upload and view 4K images&lt;/a&gt; on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts arrives in the US to take on TikTok, but the beta is still half-baked</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRwCZZ"&gt;YouTube Shorts, the company’s short-form answer to TikTok, is launching in beta in the United States starting today. The short video format has already been available for several months in India, but today marks its debut stateside (along with the addition of several new features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMCqB"&gt;For the beta launch, YouTube Shorts will feature all the basics of any TikTok clone: a multi-segment camera that makes it easy for creators to quickly string together clips, a wide selection of music tracks (with catalogs from “over 250 labels and publishers”), and a robust-looking captioning tool, the last of which is debuting alongside the US launch. “We really want to create a playground of creativity here where we give creators the raw materials to produce great videos,” says Todd Sherman, YouTube’s product lead for Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FawHsP"&gt;Like TikTok, users will be able to swipe through an endless, algorithmically generated feed of short videos, subscribe to their favorite creators, explore specific hashtags or sounds, and remix other videos’ audio tracks. Even the interface looks similar to TikTok’s player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eJpGsV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorts is for “that next generation of creators” who may find traditional YouTube “too difficult”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UVHp0a"&gt;But instead of getting its own app, Shorts will live on a new carousel on the home tab of the mobile YouTube app. (The company is also experimenting with a dedicated Shorts tab.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9VjF8"&gt;And while Shorts checks off a lot of the basics, it’s missing plenty of features that make TikTok such a unique viral hit. There’s virtually no collaborative features available in Shorts at launch — so users won’t be able to reply to other videos or join together in a version of TikTok’s popular duet or stitch features. Also missing is a way to view a more curated feed. For now, Shorts only offers its main, algorithmic feed (similar to TikTok’s “For You” page), with no option to only view videos from accounts to which you’ve subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeIpWM"&gt;Sherman says that the company views Shorts as a new avenue for the next generation of content creators to emerge. YouTube itself is filled with a hyper-competitive landscape of established creators who specialize in making videos that typically run 10 minutes or longer. Shorts offers creators a chance to break that mold, much like what YouTube originally offered to internet creators when it first launched in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPOT6P"&gt;“I think the real core of what Shorts is about is enabling that next generation of creators that maybe even found it too difficult, previously, to even consider creating on YouTube,” Sherman explains. “And if we can help fulfill our mission of giving them a voice, then I think that would make us feel like we’re continuing to grow a YouTube in a way that keeps it relevant for this next generation of creators to find a voice on this platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqw9qe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GrfXSNmTpQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHhB4l"&gt;That’s not to say that Shorts won’t offer anything to existing creators. For starters, YouTube will share subscriptions across traditional channels and Shorts. So any users that find your content in Shorts and subscribe to get more of it will also be signing up for any long-form videos, and creators with tons of subscribers already will have a built-in audience to whom they can deliver Shorts. In at least one implementation of Shorts that the company is trying, Shorts videos will appear directly in users’ subscription tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCHBZ6"&gt;According to Sherman, YouTube has some big plans for how it’ll tie Shorts into the broader YouTube ecosystem down the line — features that might help the fledgling service stand out in a crowded field that’s already dominated by TikTok and other (less established) competitors like Instagram’s Reels or Snapchat’s Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="be4hQm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube hasn’t shared how creators can monetize their videos yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVVlwT"&gt;And those features are going to be essential: YouTube is coming very late to a party that’s already ruled by TikTok, and as Reels and Spotlight have shown, its no small task to not only replicate but outdo TikTok’s seemingly magical blend of algorithmic alchemy, collaborative tools, and viral trends. Unfortunately, YouTube Shorts is already playing catch-up, and its uniquely YouTube features are still very half-baked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TCszX"&gt;Shorts does have a few clever ties into traditional YouTube videos: at launch, creators will be able to jump right to creating a Short from music videos for licensed songs, for instance. And in the future, the company plans to allow users to remix sound from any YouTube video for use in Shorts, a potential goldmine of content for creators to remix into new memes and videos. (YouTube users will be able to opt out, if they’d prefer to not have their audios used.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXkco5"&gt;But Shorts just still barely scratches the surface. For example, Shorts that use a song clip can link out to the music video on YouTube proper, but there’s no easy collection or link to find Shorts of a song from the regular video player, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9tTPk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-ay_m4AljU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nipIP5"&gt;While it’s starting from behind, YouTube is an unparalleled force for videos online, and the fact that creators can seamlessly transition between Shorts and long-form videos — while bringing their audiences with them — isn’t something to discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W2tQa"&gt;“As we grow Shorts, we can connect that ecosystem to the broader YouTube. And that means that if you are a short-form creator and you grow to be a long-form creator, that audience can grow with you,” Sherman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KGtc9"&gt;Being able to directly link to the original sources of content for audio — whether it be a song, a movie clip, or a snippet of an interview — is also a powerful advantage for YouTube, as is the sheer size of the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsToCe"&gt;As Sherman explains, “One of the underpinnings that has helped so many people become creators is that you if give them high-quality inputs, they’re more likely to get to high-quality outputs by remixing other things.” And if you’re looking for videos to input, it’s hard to find a bigger source of them than Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgwnQF"&gt;But there are still big unanswered questions that YouTube has to figure out about Shorts — chief among them, how creators will make money. “I think the world has come to expect YouTube to support creators. And I think that’s going to extend to Shorts also,” says Sherman. “The way we think about it is: television has a different business model than movies, YouTube has a different business model than television, and short-form video is going to have a different business model than long-form YouTube.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bsojl"&gt;For now, though, YouTube isn’t making any announcements as to what monetization options will look like on Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNZeIH"&gt;Another big question is what — if anything — YouTube is planning to do to make sure that Shorts doesn’t end up as another place for clout-chasing content farmers to just repost popular TikToks and reap the rewards (something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;Instagram Reels continues to struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.) Sherman says that it’s something that the Shorts team is looking into, but that they have a fine line to walk: YouTube doesn’t want to discourage creators from posting their content on multiple platforms, but it also doesn’t want people just reposting videos from other people that they just downloaded off TikTok either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqtuBc"&gt;The company says that it’ll take a bit of time for Shorts to roll out, but that it should “be available to everybody in the US over the next several weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8m8t7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZPxVF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGAANN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZhz1X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wK8g6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV finally adds Nick Jr. (and the rest of ViacomCBS’s channels)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NSz0OszL3Ithb2s61a4tTEMmFrs=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983498/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWAFoG"&gt;YouTube TV added popular missing channels like MTV and Nickelodeon in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;striking a deal with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt;, but now the streaming service is finally adding in the remaining stragglers like Nick Jr. and MTV2, according to &lt;a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/youtube-tv-adds-the-missing-batch-of-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatToWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSenRm"&gt;The new additions include Nick Jr., Teen Nick, Nicktoons, MTV Classic, MTV2, Dabl, and BET Her. Generally these channels are spinoffs of more well-known offerings like BET and MTV, but Nick Jr.’s younger children’s programming will definitely have some parents breathing a sigh of relief. Dabl — which I had never heard of before today — is apparently ViacomCBS’s “lifestyle-oriented network” for licensing cooking and homemaking shows like &lt;em&gt;Emeril Live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Martha Stewart Living&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably great for a late-night marathon or your daily background noise while working around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfylHk"&gt;Unlike the original addition of ViacomCBS’s biggest channels, this new drop won’t come with a price increase to YouTube TV, but it is the most recent in a collection of small updates the service has received in the last month. In February, YouTube TV announced that it plans to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;a 4K streaming option and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. That same month, it also introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289589/youtube-tv-hbo-max-showtime-starz-bundle-virtual-premium-cable"&gt;a $30 add-on bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 cheaper than they would be separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube can now warn creators about copyright issues before videos are posted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRow8qz9JoKV5i7a_3BbdSA4Q84=/231x0:1287x704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983312/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_3.25.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0udkz"&gt;In an effort to make the process of uploading a video and receiving ad revenue easier, YouTube is rolling out a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/102365314"&gt;new tool called “Checks”&lt;/a&gt; that tells a creator ahead of time if their video contains copyrighted material and complies with advertising guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUdcyS"&gt;Prior to Checks, creators uploaded their videos to YouTube and hoped everything went off &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/10/17268102/youtube-demonetization-pewdiepie-logan-paul-casey-neistat-philip-defranco"&gt;without a hitch&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;uploads for copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;, which could lead to takedowns or copyright holders claiming ad revenue, and whether the video runs afoul of advertising guideline issues. YouTube’s goal is to effectively cut down on the amount of “yellow icons” creators see next to their video, referring to the yellow dollar signs that suggest ad revenue is being held because of copyright or guideline problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxn6tH"&gt;This new system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12165194/youtube-content-id-2-billion-paid"&gt;reliant on Content ID&lt;/a&gt;. If YouTube’s copyright identification system finds a violation after a video is scanned, the rights holder’s policy will be automatically applied to the video, according to the company. This could result in either the video being blocked entirely or the rights holders monetizing the video instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qed1Dm"&gt;If Content ID matches content in the creator’s video to another rights holder, the YouTuber uploading said video will receive notice via Checks to find a way to remove that part of the video ahead of time. This means that videos can start earning revenue the second they’re uploaded instead of going through a claim dispute, which can impact the overall advertising revenue a creator earns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRE4wt"&gt;So what happens if a copyright claim is found, but the creator doesn’t think they’re doing anything wrong? YouTube will allow creators to dispute the claim prior to publishing. Since claims take a few days to process, YouTubers can either choose to wait until the dispute is settled before publishing, or they can publish the video while waiting for the final result. If the dispute finds that the creator did not use copyrighted content, ad revenue earned during that time is paid out to said person. If the dispute finds the rights holder is correct, the ad revenue is paid out to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJDbki"&gt;YouTube is simply making it easier for creators to find — and dispute — claims ahead of time. It’s part of the company’s ongoing efforts to ensure that creators can monetize their videos as quickly and effectively as possible. Other methods, including walking creators through how changes to metadata and tagging can affect revenue post-publishing, are at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg"&gt;a new Creators Insider video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B0A1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRND5H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s70eeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKW9bX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube pulls racist Steven Crowder video for violating COVID misinformation policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J42JBtOqFfpwnBaGOA2_EPQQZfc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981728/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_8.53.36_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlCkM3"&gt;YouTube has pulled a video from conservative commentator Steven Crowder for violating its COVID-19 misinformation policy. A clip from the video where Crowder made racist comments about Black farmers was widely criticized on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJqR1R"&gt;“This video violates our &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785?hl=en"&gt;COVID-19 misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits content claiming that the death rates of COVID-19 are less severe or equally as severe as the common cold or seasonal flu,” YouTube said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, the video was removed from Steven Crowder’s channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJTspZ"&gt;The video was flagged by YouTube’s automated systems when it was uploaded, was immediately blocked from running ads, and was never monetized, YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. YouTube has removed other videos that violate the company’s policies from Crowder’s channel in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTaUyn"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;revoked the ability to run ads&lt;/a&gt; on his channel in August 2019 after former &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; host Carlos Maza evidenced numerous instances of Crowder using derogatory and homophobic comments when talking about Maza. The instance, and conversations about harassment on YouTube that followed, led to YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21005185/youtube-harassment-policy-update-malicious-expression-public-figures-maza-crowder"&gt;introducing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; specifically designed to curb creator-on-creator harassment. After a year demonetizing Crowder’s channel, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;enabled his ability to run ads&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZwzdo"&gt;(Disclosure: &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; is a publication of Vox Media, which also owns &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this: the fight over YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news site — and a cat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iUQYcKGO6KPnBCX2eosNnoMiyPM=/0x9:3918x2621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951186/Screen_Shot_2021_03_11_at_12.38.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SCNR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SqUIW"&gt;YouTube drama remains some of the most interesting drama, and &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on infighting at political YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news company — and the fate of a cat named Betsy — is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uccKyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;’s Will Sommer sets the scene with Pool’s background as a former &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reporter who went independent as an alt-right-adjacent YouTube creator. But the meat of the report is the fight over Subverse, a news media &lt;a href="https://scnr.com/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SCNRtv/featured"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; (renamed SCNR for a hilarious reason you should read the report to learn) for which Pool and his former business partner, Emily Molli, raised over $1 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBaUre"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7URS4gFQFGw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0vV4A"&gt;Molli was joined by another &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;alum, Rocco Castoro, to get the YouTube operation off the ground, and the resulting videos feel a lot like &lt;em&gt;Vice’s &lt;/em&gt;own documentary work. But then problems arose. “Tensions between Pool and his other partners flared...over who had access to various internal systems connected to Subverse,” writes Sommer. Those tensions would lead to Castoro and Molli investigating Pool for “unsavory internet schemes” and leave Betsy, Molli’s cat, allegedly held hostage at Pool’s mansion in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObTlei"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;Sommer’s report on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the complicated journey Betsy took to get back to Molli. But for now, remember: never let your cat go to a second location with a YouTube creator / podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3FtxzF"&gt;So this was a weird one: depending on the browser you’re using, your space bar may not have worked in the YouTube.com search bar for a little while today. Pressing it would make absolutely nothing happen, so your YouTube searches ended up being one long string of words. The bug seemed to be around for an hour, based on when people started sounding off about it on Twitter, but as of 3:50PM ET, the site appeared to be working correctly again on all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWb5EZ"&gt;The bug affected the desktop site, but only browsers that aren’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on Chrome. Firefox wouldn’t take spaces in Windows, macOS, or even Android if you requested the desktop version of the website. Safari on iPhones worked as normal, but the problems showed up on Safari on iPad — probably because iPads request the desktop site, too. Asking for the mobile version immediately fixed it there, and requesting the desktop site on an iPhone immediately broke spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxO3If"&gt;The good news is that the lack of spaces probably didn’t affect your YouTube experience much — it’s very good at understanding your intent even on long, relatively obscure searches with a bunch of words smashed together.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc_-A8Cw3uRxM_L_wNGgwH1Hyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_11.12.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s search algorithm was still able to figure it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s00fKw"&gt;There was also another, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more annoying bug: if you were trying to watch a video and type in the search bar at the same time, your keystrokes would end up acting as shortcuts. Pressing the space bar wouldn’t do anything in the search bar, but it would pause your video. Your “T” might show up in the search bar, but it also switched my video into theater mode. This issue is also fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing in the search bar made many awful things happen on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKc0cx"&gt;YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the issue now appears to be fixed. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ma6x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the bug appears to have been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
