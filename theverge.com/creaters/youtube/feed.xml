    <title>Baby Shark is the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kxYgKE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"&gt;“Baby Shark”&lt;/a&gt; became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546350/baby-shark-youtube-video-most-popular-despacito-masha"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and just over a year later, it has achieved another huge milestone: it has become the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ik1Wh2"&gt;“Baby Shark” is a cultural touchstone at this point. I remember singing it at summer camps as a kid growing up, and given the record-breaking popularity of the music video (which was created by the entertainment company Pinkfong), it seems I’m not the only person who will never forget this song. (I’ve been idly tapping my foot to the beat in my head the entire time I’ve been writing this post.) But the song’s impact doesn’t stop with the earworm hit. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10518284/"&gt;a Baby Shark show on Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/baby-shark-movie-1235063576/"&gt;a Baby Shark movie&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, as you may have feared, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pinkfong-unveils-baby-sharks-first-ever-nft-collection-on-makersplace-301433995.html"&gt;Baby Shark NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aMFUd"&gt;If you’re curious what the other top-viewed YouTube videos are, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos"&gt;Wikipedia looks to have a comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt;. The second most-viewed as of this writing is Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” which held the crown before “Baby Shark” did, though, with 7.7 billion views, it has a long way to go to try and catch the shark. (And I hope that by mentioning another extremely catchy song, I got “Baby Shark” out of your head for the day.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OP7lPoF9NjIHj15Xk3XaYcX_0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297871/1230436485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mh8joz"&gt;There’s something extraordinarily frustrating about subscribing to a TV service only for that service to lose the programming you signed up for. But that threat of lost channels — or worse, the actual loss of major networks — is a recurring problem for internet TV services, and it comes up &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cFpe8"&gt;The latest incident hit just this weekend: late Friday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX, disappeared from YouTube TV when the two companies failed to reach a deal to keep them on the streaming service. The dispute didn’t last long. Just 36-or-so hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845373/youtube-tv-disney-espn-channel-fx-abc-restored"&gt;the companies came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; — soon enough to avoid anyone missing ESPN’s Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y250tf"&gt;It was an outcome Disney could pretty much bank on. “Great content always wins and has great leverage,” Keith Zubchevich, CEO of streaming data company Conviva, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Audiences want the best content, regardless of where they pay for it or watch it. It’s up to aggregators and big platforms to make sure they get the deal done, especially in streaming where consumer choice is even greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0iMSo"&gt;Seeing two companies publicly duke it out over contract negotiations like this has become commonplace. In July, Fubo TV lost &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/tv/2021/07/ae-history-lifetime-channels-dropped-by-fubotv-in-what-company-deems-a-cost-cutting-measure.html"&gt;several channels&lt;/a&gt; from A+E Networks, including History Channel, Lifetime, and A&amp;amp;E. Hulu with Live TV has lost &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/sinclair-rsn"&gt;support for some Fox regional sports channels&lt;/a&gt; last year, while Sling TV lost &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;NBC regional sports networks&lt;/a&gt; in April. YouTube TV has publicly sparred with Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; in the past four months alone, reaching last-minute deals that allowed users to continue using their services or platforms as they had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rjMPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They essentially want the consumer to get mad.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqWqGf"&gt;Each time, these negotiations broke out into public view, letting subscribers know their service’s channel selection may be on the line. So why play up the drama and send subscribers into a tizzy — or worse, have to issue rapid-fire news updates about dropped and subsequently restored service — when more often than not, a resolution is the most likely outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyWeAn"&gt;“They’re all playing to the same audience, which is the consumer. They essentially want the consumer to get mad,” Zubchevich says. “It’s all about a narrative in the public perspective that is essentially trying to maintain: how are viewers going to hold value in different brands?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kj4pU"&gt;In streaming, content is only as valuable as its ability to hang on to customers. So while Disney and YouTube TV were unable to reach a deal initially last week, YouTube TV clearly foresaw the impact the loss of those channels could have on its business. Disney is the parent of ESPN, and YouTube TV was positioned to lose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;five ESPN properties&lt;/a&gt; should the two parties have failed to reach an agreement. With Monday Night Football in full swing, the impact on YouTube TV’s business would have almost certainly been brutal. So it’s no shock that YouTube TV worked diligently to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o84I1Q"&gt;“Sports has always been a genre of entertainment, much like movies, that drives engagement, drives subscribership, that drives viewership,” Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with Parks Associates, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The collective sports content community understands the value of what they’re offering. They can drive engagement and subscribership arguably like no other genre in any video. So they know that their content is of value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ryHGIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrzTn"&gt;These disputes are part of the growing pains that come with making content deals in such a new space. Zubchevich says networks don’t want to make long-lasting deals because it’s hard to estimate what their content will be worth even a couple years out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA1mvc"&gt;“Carriage deals are so short because viewing is growing so rapidly, it’s nearly impossible to quantify a multi-year deal or predict what viewing will look like on a longer timeframe,” Zubchevich says. “And it’s so last minute because they’re trying to determine whether content or eyeballs are king — waiting to see who will blink first as it plays out in public view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SP8BY"&gt;Plus, new ad formats and distribution options make streaming-era negotiations for content even more complex, Anjali Midha, co-founder and CEO of analytics company Diesel Labs, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ3Kt2"&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential,” Midha says. “There’s also the need to maintain much more flexibility given the industry is still transforming around us. As a result, it’s not a big surprise that the negotiations are much more complex and taking longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS1oLI"&gt;Youtube TV and Disney may be resolved, but the tight turnaround may just suggest the strategy works — wait till the last second, alert consumers, and fight for a better deal — and we’ll see more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and YouTube TV cut a deal to bring back ESPN, FX, and other channels</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1kaPt"&gt;Disney and YouTube TV have reached a deal today to put more than a dozen Disney-owned channels back on Google’s internet TV streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDgJod"&gt;The news follows a previous announcement late Friday that the two had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;failed to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; before their contract expired, and users were informed they would no longer have access to the channels, which included ESPN, Disney, FX, and other Disney-owned properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYw0eS"&gt;“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks,” Disney said in a statement. “We appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, and we’re thrilled that our robust lineup of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming is in the process of being restored to YouTube TV subscribers across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmTw1a"&gt;With the loss of channels, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 to $49.99 per month. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the reinstated service, YouTube TV said it would return to its original $64.99-per-month service cost, but that it will “honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1vDaH"&gt;“For active members who have not yet received that $15 discount on their monthly bill, you will automatically receive a one-time credit on your next bill with no action needed,” YouTube TV said. “For members who were impacted and have initiated the cancellation process, we would love to welcome you back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng2o9T"&gt;YouTube TV said that it has started to restore access to the Disney-owned properties on its service, including local ABC stations, which will return “over the course of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV loses ESPN, other Disney networks after failing to reach new deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRQSZ8rsOJRkLGrBM4H92Yf8idM=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290174/1236794676.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIpNoJ"&gt;YouTube TV has failed to reach an eleventh-hour deal with Disney to keep more than a dozen Disney-owned channels on the live TV streaming service. As of December 18th, popular networks including ESPN and ABC have been removed from the service. As promised, YouTube TV has dropped its subscription to $50 per month as a direct result of the lost programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmJt1"&gt;Disney said in a statement late Friday that after ongoing negotiations with YouTube TV, “they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59idpb"&gt;“As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks including live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from ABC, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels,” the company added. “We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yybvk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV said it would “continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL1MYp"&gt;“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months,” YouTube TV said. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEBkGZ"&gt;The announcement follows a notice shared with subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833849/youtube-tv-disney-carrier-dispute-abc-news-espn-december-17"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the channels could vanish from YouTube TV on Friday, December 17th if a deal was not reached between the two companies. Should negotiations have failed, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 a month from its normal price of $65 per month to compensate for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68xPDf"&gt;Earlier this week, a positive resolution to the service loss seemed likely. For one, the service told subscribers in an email on Monday that the House of Mouse “is an important partner for us,” adding that it hoped to negotiate a deal with Disney “provided we can reach equitable terms.” But the companies failed to reach a deal as their current agreement lapsed after December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjBqy"&gt;The loss of over a dozen channels doesn’t exactly help YouTube TV remain competitive against other internet cable services like Hulu with Live TV or Fubo TV. Not only are a dozen-plus channels getting wiped from service, but the list of Disney-owned properties that would be axed is extensive, including not only Disney channels but FX, ESPN, and National Geographic channels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt6lX8"&gt;The full list of channels that left because a deal was not reached include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSVKDl"&gt;Your local ABC channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gFaE4O"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72HTNZ"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ewvx48"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pZSi1J"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iqBij3"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8KgIcc"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U7e16Q"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5zOJgq"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlAuvW"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWgOJw"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eHN7rI"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38eRKt"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgi7xm"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I7dODa"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwESS1"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1o3Azw"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKLTHR"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw6GWW"&gt;Carriage disputes are frustratingly common in our new streaming landscape, and they often play out publicly before a resolution is reached — as was the case recently with YouTube TV and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;NBCUniversal-owned channels&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequently, two parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;fail to reach a deal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the consumer who winds up paying the price by having to shop around for a new provider if they want support for their favorite programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minecraft crosses 1 trillion views on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="minecraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsF-_9U-r2mSe7jPdkGL2X-H13w=/0x21:1100x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278139/Minecraft-360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnQdWk"&gt;Long before the metaverse became the premier destination of tech companies and newlyweds, there was &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. It is a platform that started as a video game about dodging explosions from hissing cactus-shaped creatures and became the blank canvas on which millions of players create their content, upload it, and generate trillions of views — literally. Today, YouTube, in collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;developer Mojang, is celebrating an unprecedented trillionth view (trillion with a &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;) with a snapshot of the game’s unique and transformative history on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNhjYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller Lydia Winters attributes the game’s trillion views to her team’s respect for the myriad ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5KlwK"&gt;“We have people who are off on an adventure and people who are building and people who are playing together, and all those ways of playing are important to us,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller, her team’s job is to create and curate a world players want to create in. That enabling of all kinds of storytelling has been critical to the game’s nigh untouchable popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCRd9U"&gt;“The reason why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been so successful on YouTube is because YouTube videos are a way to tell stories,” she says. “So then when you have &lt;em&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/em&gt; and you can tell any story you want in a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; world, it’s a big reason why we have so many people creating&lt;em&gt; Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9WtFl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All those ways of playing are important to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmujtn"&gt;By the numbers, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube community has over 35,000 creators from over 150 countries. The kind of content on YouTube ranges from simple role-playing “Let’s Plays” to videos that don’t feature actual gameplay from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayyVUl"&gt;Earnest Pettie, culture and trends insights lead at YouTube, is responsible for keeping track of all the weird and wild ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on the site. He’s fascinated by one creator in particular who uses the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic and is popular within the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community without actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN9V0c"&gt;“Interestingly, one of the biggest trends on &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;is actually animation, and that’s animation either created with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; or animation that is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic,” Petite says. “There’s this creator named Jake Fellman, who creates YouTube shorts. He’s created about 100 &lt;em&gt;Minecraft-inspired&lt;/em&gt; shorts that are actually computer animation. He’s one of the most viewed &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; creators of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0Ntz8"&gt;Fellman’s videos are 15-second bursts of hyper-realistic, “What if &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; graphics were rendered with the Unreal Engine 5” shorts that feature cute interactions with monsters or sheep and garner over 1 million views a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftpx9k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6O5LgOZl-I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9aS4U"&gt;YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/minecraft-trillion/"&gt;a fascinating breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of the history of the game on its platform over the last 11 years, complete with stats and graphs and facts about what it took to make 1 trillion views. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtrgJt_lnjr3XqaMDwksa-4FU1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099334/minecraftgraph.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="44uRvU"&gt;It’s interesting to see how genres of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos change over time as they fade in and out of popularity. In &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s early years, the multi-million view hits were &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I-sH53vXP2A"&gt;music video parodies&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; household names like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ"&gt;CaptainSparklez&lt;/a&gt;. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt; (who recently won a Game Award for content creator of the year) dominates the charts with his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RJ0jdO5ZfU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; manhunt series&lt;/a&gt; that features his friends trying to stop Dream from completing the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJOsXy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game on YouTube ever. In 2020, it earned over 200 billion views; second place — which was curiously Roblox, another sandbox-style game — earned less than half that. Part of that seemingly untouchable popularity is because of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s nature. It’s an open space ripe for all kinds of creation and iteration on that creation in a way no other video game can boast. The other reason, according to Pettie, is the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkcIfU"&gt;“One trillion views doesn’t happen without the creative ingenuity of all the creators who have uploaded &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos over the years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rejuOz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1bu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV warns subscribers it could lose Disney’s channels later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOVVwiqNzAvhFhq51X2-sXYFOic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268622/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyMCeF"&gt;Google has warned that YouTube TV could lose access to over a dozen Disney-owned channels later this week if it’s unable to renew its agreement with the company. In a &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV says its current deal with Disney is due to expire this Friday, December 17th, after which the channels could disappear if it’s unable to reach a new agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXJErM"&gt;“Our ask of Disney, as with all of our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider – by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them,” YouTube’s blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA6lGF"&gt;Here’s the list of impacted channels. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-channels-pulled-youtube-tv-1235061987/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that eight ABC local stations could also disappear from YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THHcx7"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n7zA2I"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pOgMmH"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UONIYH"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cFXKPu"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfvV2X"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33a4HL"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPwucW"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FRDRm2"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XS2dPN"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wBVBxJ"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E64O4W"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="afjA3W"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWZSf0"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GQmtnz"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlXfrR"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5jlW6"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jbI7jn"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Disney said that it’s “committed to working with Google to reach a fair, market-based agreement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYbHEv"&gt;“We are optimistic that we can reach a deal and continue to provide their YouTube TV customers with our live sporting events and news coverage plus kids, family and general entertainment programming,” Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2aXU8O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always want to be transparent and give you a heads-up during these active conversations. Disney is an important partner, and we’re optimistic that we can work with Disney and keep their content available on YouTube TV. For live updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5"&gt;https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube TV (@YouTubeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1470533371046416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBOTnY"&gt;If a deal can’t be reached by December 17th, YouTube TV says it will decrease its prices by $15 per month while Disney’s channels are off its service. It says that customers are free to pause or cancel their memberships at any time, and points them towards Disney’s $13.99 per month streaming bundle if they want to maintain access to “some” of Disney’s content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5mMJ1"&gt;This is just the latest high profile carriage dispute YouTube TV has been involved in this year. These have affected both the company’s deals to offer streaming content from other companies, as well as its agreements with hardware providers to host YouTube’s apps. Less than three months ago the service was just days away from losing access to NBCUniversal’s channels before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;reaching an agreement in early October&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this month it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;reached an agreement with Roku&lt;/a&gt; for it to continue carrying YouTube’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast now sells Xfinity Flex users internet cable TV from YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrwiM_klb8ozay2ZHEgUg-pZzBU=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251941/Web_Publishing_XfinityFlex_YouTubeTVLaunch_16x9_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NRDjUc"&gt;Comcast is introducing YouTube TV to its Xfinity Flex devices, providing users another avenue for opting out of traditional cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MgqhS"&gt;YouTube was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previously supported&lt;/a&gt; on Comcast’s Flex boxes, but the addition of YouTube TV gives users the ability to get some 85-plus live television channels for $65 per month. It’s not the first live TV streaming service to arrive on the platform — Sling and Hulu with Live TV were already supported. But it does diversify the streaming options for people who don’t want to pay Comcast for cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpmBa5"&gt;Colin Petrie-Norris, senior vice president of consumer entertainment at Xfinity, said &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of YouTube TV “is another example of how we surround our broadband service with value, giving our customers access to all their preferred content and subscriptions on one device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWItlR"&gt;It’s a curious move from a cable provider, but it also makes sense if Comcast wants to stay competitive against other over-the-top boxes like Roku, Fire TV Stick, or Chromecast — all of which support YouTube TV. Currently, Comcast provides the boxes to its Xfinity Internet customers at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no additional cost&lt;/a&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need people to use them. And that means supporting popular apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k57vG9"&gt;YouTube TV is available to Flex users beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8PPE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new year-end live event, Escape2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooGePdsoPo3VwWxLUToyJLwfQBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250714/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQqmJa"&gt;YouTube will host a 24-hour interactive live event featuring musicians and creators to look back on the platform’s biggest trends and videos of 2021, the company announced today. The event, called Escape2021, will have three chapters, the first of which begins on December 16th at midnight ET. The goal of Escape2021: liberate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJRHqCRvD0c"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; from the confines of her bedroom and studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oSqOA"&gt;Escape2021 comes after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube Rewind, the high-production recap videos the company published at the end of each year that had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;derided by creators&lt;/a&gt; for sanitizing the platform to appeal to advertisers. YouTube said in October it would “refocus our energies” to create different kinds of productions instead. Escape2021 isn’t meant to replace Rewind but offer a new way to celebrate the year’s biggest trends, Lauren Verrusio, a YouTube spokesperson, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyDbmD"&gt;The event seems to be an attempt by YouTube to offer more immersive online experiences, like when fans watched &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-army-butter-melting-video-9564987/"&gt;butter melt&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a new BTS song. YouTube says there will be trivia questions, trend-based challenges, and “real-time live experiences,” all leading up to musical performances. One example of a challenge, echoing the BTS livestream, will require viewers to identify what butter sculptures the band has melted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASw5Bl"&gt;YouTube says the event will include performances and appearances from BTS, Doja Cat, and Mark Rober, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nMNN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 9th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a comment from a YouTube spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku settles YouTube dispute and locks down apps in ‘multi-year’ deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44iguyJWJvPtvclOTEijl986rw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244236/DSCF3621_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnZz6h"&gt;Roku has reached a deal with Google to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on its platform. The two had been at odds over a contract extension, sparring over what Roku described as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;onerous demands&lt;/a&gt; by Google for more data and more prominent placement on its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfIeay"&gt;If they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22820988/roku-google-youtube-december-9-deadline"&gt;hadn’t reached an agreement by tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Google planned to pull the YouTube app from Roku — a loss for basically everyone involved, but especially Roku users who would have no longer been able to download a key video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmEijN"&gt;“This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” Dallas Lawrence, a Roku spokesperson, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google confirmed the deal to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said both apps will be available through the Roku store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7cjso"&gt;Roku described the deal as a “multi-year extension” for YouTube and YouTube TV. YouTube TV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled by Roku from its channel store&lt;/a&gt; in April as tensions between the two parties escalated. After months of stalled negotiations, Google said in late October that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;it would pull the YouTube app on December 9th&lt;/a&gt; if a deal hadn’t been reached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku could lose YouTube this week — so now’s a good time to download the app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxyQ__NtaB6e8Idm8KRCQL50E1U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240836/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6YxOkB"&gt;An escalating feud that has pitted YouTube, one of the most popular streaming apps in the world, against Roku, a leader in TV streaming devices, could be about to boil over. Both companies have said that unless they can reach a new distribution agreement in the coming days, the YouTube app will be removed from Roku’s channel store for new users on December 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5LoWy"&gt;The major development would follow months of stalled negotiations, and there have already been consequences for consumers caught in the middle: the YouTube TV app was pulled from Roku’s channel store earlier this year, though it can still be accessed by customers who already downloaded it. Now the much more popular &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/d5d327036e51ffcf1a4780dd78a85a3b/youtube"&gt;YouTube app&lt;/a&gt;, a portal to the world’s largest video sharing platform, faces the same cutoff and store removal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIshxa"&gt;With the deadline for a new YouTube deal looming, Google and Roku have continued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;publicly bickering and expressing frustration&lt;/a&gt; with each other over the last several months. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv?Ref=CJ&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cj_affiliate_sale&amp;amp;utm_content=5040886&amp;amp;utm_term=11553901&amp;amp;cjevent=4c23ff1d56d111ec81e1d2f30a82b832" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku has accused Google of anticompetitive behavior&lt;/a&gt; and says the company’s terms and requests go beyond the asks of other major streaming services, while Google has maintained Roku’s claims are baseless and criticized the company for trying to negotiate new deals for YouTube TV and YouTube simultaneously instead of handling them separately. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;added a YouTube TV backdoor&lt;/a&gt; directly to the regular YouTube app to preserve live TV access for subscribers of the $65-per-month service; Roku responded by calling this the behavior of an “unchecked monopolist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmWmLF"&gt;Losing YouTube would be a significant blow for Roku’s platform, though it’s one that others have faced. Amazon’s Fire TV devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;went without an official YouTube app&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year before the two sides came to a deal in that case and the app returned. Apple has managed to keep YouTube on its Apple TV set-top boxes from the start, though its own differences with Google have sometimes delayed features like 4K playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4Ztly"&gt;Still, one of the core appeals of Roku is its simplicity and vast app selection. Having a hole the size of YouTube in its app catalog would throw a wrench into that reputation. This type of situation always comes down to the wire — just as it recently did when YouTube TV and NBCUniversal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;managed to settle tense carriage talks&lt;/a&gt; without any channels being lost. So stay tuned, and it’d be a good idea to &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/d5d327036e51ffcf1a4780dd78a85a3b/youtube"&gt;download YouTube to your Roku devices&lt;/a&gt; now just in case things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
