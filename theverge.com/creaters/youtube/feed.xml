    <title>YouTube demonetizes David Dobrik’s channels over Vlog Squad sexual assault allegations  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgDDdk"&gt;YouTube has temporarily demonetized multiple David Dobrik channels after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-demonetizing-david-dobrik-following-vlog-squad-scandal-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of Dobrik’s channels have been demonetized; David Dobrik, David Dobrik Too, and the channel for his video podcast, Views. As well as Dobrik’s channels, YouTube has also demonetized Durte Dom, the personal channel of the ex-Vlog Squad member at the center of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfElQl"&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “We have temporarily suspended monetization on David Dobrik and Durte Dom channels for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgEN1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47Y84t"&gt;The video platform is the latest organization to take action against Dobrik after the allegations emerged in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. In it, a woman featured in a 2018 vlog said that the former Vlog Squad member engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. Footage from the night of the incident was later published in a since-removed YouTube video titled  “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyb00"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB734hc89x8"&gt;most recent video&lt;/a&gt; addressing the controversy, Dobrik apologized for his role in the incident. “I want to apologize to her and her friends for ever putting them in an environment that I enabled that made them feel like their safety and values were compromised. I’m so sorry.” Dobrik also confirmed he took the decision to stop filming with the former Vlog Squad member in 2019. “I fully believe the woman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sycRhp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2021/3/23/22346231/david-dobrik-advertisers-assault-allegations-old-videos"&gt;More than a dozen advertisers&lt;/a&gt; have cut ties with Dobrik after the report emerged, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook. Dobrik has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;parted ways with disposable camera app Dispo&lt;/a&gt;, an app he co-founded in 2019, in light of the allegations. The app has lost investors including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373855197831720963%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22344171%2Fdavid-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;Spark Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/david-dobriks-dispo-loses-another-investor-the-ceo-of-lime-2021-3?r=ts-sub"&gt;Lime CEO Wayne Ting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MrBeast working with $2 million fund to invest in up-and-coming creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of MrBeast." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1ZDD8zOsJrPZAKr-sL59N6Ouxw=/88x0:1140x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020695/18.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson. | Photo: Night Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wow8GJ"&gt;MrBeast said last year that he wanted a way to invest in up-and-coming creators, help them blow up, and get a cut of their business in return — and today, he’s announcing a plan to do just about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLNV5"&gt;The hit YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is working with a $2 million investment fund that will offer creators up to $250,000 in exchange for a stake in their channels. The fund, called Juice Funds, is part of a new company that Donaldson is a minority owner of called &lt;a href="https://getjuice.com/"&gt;Creative Juice&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance"&gt;announced this afternoon in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTyauU"&gt;“We’re gonna make sure we find [creators] that actually need a giant cash inflow and aren’t just trying to go buy a Lamborghini,” Donaldson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJcttY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Juice is going to change so much you guys don’t even understand. Genuinely excited :)&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1374806609604583429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iRvj4"&gt;Details about the investment fund are limited right now. Juice Funds hasn’t said when it will launch or what type of creators it’s looking to invest in. Donaldson said the idea is to help YouTubers “pour gas on the fire” the way a business might by raising an influx of cash once they’re already growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuIcB"&gt;MrBeast is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20924718/mrbeast-youtube-stunts-challenges-money-philanthropy-creators-morgz"&gt;one of the biggest creators on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He has nearly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/videos"&gt;56 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and gets tens of millions of views per video (his most recent, posted a week ago, already has 35 million views). He’s known for pulling off goofy, supersized stunts — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwy_rKc7gI"&gt;like making a “2,000 gallon” cereal bowl&lt;/a&gt; — but mainly, he’s known for giving away cars, houses, and cash as part of his videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QENCYp"&gt;The investment fund is just one part of what Creative Juice plans to offer. The company is developing tools to help creators track their performance across platforms. Investors are calling it “Square for creators” and say it plans to launch a suite of products to help creators operate more like small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYHz5t"&gt;While Creative Juice’s website says that “MrBeast will invest up to $2M” in YouTube creators, the reality is that he’s just one part of Juice Funds. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the $2 million comes from Creative Juice, not Donaldson, and that Donaldson will not be the only person picking out creators. “He will be involved in selecting and mentoring creators,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And while Donaldson will “share upside in creators” for his role in Juice Funds, it’ll be Creative Juice that directly owns the stake in these creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0eClvs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like when I see a channel that I think will blow up, I wish I could just like buy shares in it or something lol&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1333861470216609794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLGZ21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 25th, 2PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to clarify MrBeast’s role in Juice Funds. While Creative Juice initially indicated that he was overseeing the $2 million fund, the company has since clarified that he is an adviser to the company who will be involved in choosing investments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t remove a three-hour live-streamed video of the mass shooting in Boulder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gunman Opens Fires At Grocery Store In Boulder, Colorado" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dq5pQuyEwPAIJYc9e7BfBs2G5w=/0x0:3143x2095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012697/1231881876.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chet Strange / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEykZ"&gt;YouTube says the platform will not remove a controversial live-streamed video of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, despite criticism of the streamer’s tactics and commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBbeEq"&gt;“Following yesterday’s tragic shooting, bystander video of the incident was detected by our teams. While violent content intended to shock or disgust viewers is not allowed on YouTube, we do allow videos with enough news or documentary context,” YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We applied an age restriction to the content and will continue to monitor the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uemb1r"&gt;The live stream was broadcast from around the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8vn9/boulder-shooting-livestream-not-being-pulled-by-youtube"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it reached a live audience that peaked at around 30,000 people and has since been viewed around 585,000 times. The streamer, Dean Schiller, began recording inside the supermarket soon after the attack. He continued recording from outside for more than three hours, despite police requests for him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qxCUih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video has been viewed around half a million times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bM2SOR"&gt;Schiller has identified himself in the past as a citizen journalist, and in 2019, he and another videographer were &lt;a href="https://www.westword.com/news/citizen-journalists-discuss-lawsuit-against-boulder-cops-11381112"&gt;arrested and jailed for filming&lt;/a&gt; around the Boulder County Jail, following a series of videos that captured alleged police misconduct. But as &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; notes, Schiller has been criticized on several fronts for the shooting video. Some video commenters called him out for not dialing 911 or attempting to help people fleeing the building, while some &lt;a href="https://gazette.com/news/local/man-who-live-streamed-shooting-scene-at-king-soopers-well-known-to-boulder-cops/article_9d43b086-8b6a-11eb-9987-6f7ca1b5bb4c.html"&gt;other news outlets&lt;/a&gt; and anti-extremism researchers criticized him for speculating on the shooter’s motives, revealing police tactics, and briefly filming the bodies of victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5AAH"&gt;Yesterday’s shooting in Boulder left 10 people dead, and a police spokesperson &lt;a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/23/king-soopers-shooting-ahmad-al-issa-suspected-killing-10/"&gt;said the alleged killer&lt;/a&gt; was taken into custody after being shot in the leg by a police officer. Police have not offered a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTiS9"&gt;Videos of murder have created a quandary for social network moderators who are tasked with distinguishing between meaningful journalism and content that could inspire copycat attacks or play into a killer’s search for publicity. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have scrambled to remove video directly recorded by mass shooters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;including a 2019 attack&lt;/a&gt; on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. But they’ve also been criticized for &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/facebook-blames-technical-glitch-for-temporary-removal-of-falcon-heights-shooting-video/"&gt;removing video&lt;/a&gt; documenting newsworthy events like police shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2OGScb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mass shooting videos can amplify an attack’s harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWTfPh"&gt;Platforms have also responded by surfacing trusted news outlets or by limiting the reach of controversial posts, even if they’re not banned outright. But YouTube didn’t outline any specific steps it had taken on Schiller’s video beyond requiring users to log in and verify their age before viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfILwP"&gt;The video also plays into long-standing questions about how journalists should responsibly cover violence. While some YouTube comments called the video a negative byproduct of social media reporting, others drew parallels with sensationalist coverage in older mediums like TV news — comparing Schiller to the protagonist of the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbjLdF"&gt;Traditional media outlets have gradually reevaluated their playbook for reporting on mass shootings in recent years. That includes trying to avoid an inordinate focus on the shooter or unsubstantiated speculation about their motives, particularly in the early stages of an incident, when very little is known about the attack. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reportingonmassshootings.org/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; also include avoiding graphic violence that’s posted without a clear purpose — and could add to the trauma of people who have survived the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Advertisers are fleeing David Dobrik over Vlog Squad sexual assault allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2021 - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uaoq6PXe1-m-9kAAwT6ez_TvZW0=/0x0:4485x2990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012011/1306933980.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rich Fury/KCA2021/Getty Images for Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRKu1K"&gt;David Dobrik has lost more than a dozen advertisers and 300,000 YouTube subscribers over the past week after &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; detailed a rape allegation against a former member of his vlogging crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KW8egY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brands-no-longer-working-with-youtube-star-david-dobrik-list-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 11 brands, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook say they are no longer working with him. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1374204205754384390"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PopCrave &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Chipotle, which recently named a burrito after Dobrik, has dropped him. And &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/03/22/david-dobrik-seatgeek-hellofresh-sponsors-drop-vlog-squad-assault-allegations/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TubeFilter &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that SeatGeek — previously one of Dobrik’s biggest advertisers, having sponsored a number of videos in which he gives away cars to friends and family — also says it does not have plans to work with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkYmab"&gt;Advertisers are fleeing Dobrik’s channel following &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing a rape allegation against Dom Zeglaitis, better known as Durte Dom. Zeglaitis, a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad, is accused of raping a woman in the course of filming a video for Dobrik’s YouTube channel in 2018. Portions of the encounter were posted to YouTube and later taken down at the woman’s request. Dobrik said in a video posted early this morning that he stopped filming with Zeglaitis in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WTD9Y5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB734hc89x8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="npqW7y"&gt;The report followed another allegation of sexual assault by a former member of the Vlog Squad. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that Joseth “Seth” Francois said he was tricked into kissing someone as part of a “prank” video for Dobrik’s channel in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWchOI"&gt;Like many major YouTubers whose popularity exploded in the mid-to-late 2010s, Dobrik’s channel grew in part thanks to edgy videos that often involved salacious plotlines and immature pranks. As these creators have gained a bigger stage, those videos and other past behaviors have come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6v55n"&gt;Last June, several YouTubers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21306858/shane-dawson-jenna-marbles-youtube-blackface-racism-content"&gt;addressed old racist videos&lt;/a&gt; as fans demanded accountability during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308288/shane-dawson-youtube-suspends-monetization-channels-blackface-older-videos"&gt;suspended ads on Shane Dawson’s channel&lt;/a&gt; over old racist videos, Target stopped carrying his book, and the makeup company Morphe dropped his products. Jenna Marbles stepped away from YouTube as part of an apology over past racist videos. And Dobrik also issued an apology for filming racist videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noqUnH"&gt;Dobrik has faced growing consequences as the result of these latest reports. In addition to advertisers fleeing his channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;he’s parted ways&lt;/a&gt; with the hot new camera app Dispo, which he co-founded, and he’s &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/david-dobrik-angel-city-football-club-2021-3"&gt;no longer a co-owner&lt;/a&gt; of the Angel City Football Club, a US women’s soccer team co-owned by a number of celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npeE6h"&gt;There are still 18 million people subscribed to Dobrik’s YouTube channel alone, so it’s not as though his audience is gone. But sponsors are a big part of the way that top YouTubers earn money, since it insulates them from the uncertainties of YouTube’s built-in advertising system. YouTube doesn’t appear to have taken action against Dobrik’s channel. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1il5m"&gt;In his video this morning, Dobrik said he’ll be taking a short break from YouTube so he can add “infrastructure” to support his channel. That includes bringing on an HR person so people can “communicate discomfort in a way that’s comfortable to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing automatic product detection in videos</title>

  &lt;p id="r3Juxw"&gt;YouTube is always running experiments. One of its latest: testing an automated list of products detected in videos uploaded to the site. As of March 22nd this year, that test is being expanded to “people watching videos in the US,” according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. (An early version of the feature was tested midway through last year, though that test was very small, reports &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/22/youtube-experiment-will-auto-detect-products-in-videos-and-provide-related-content-links/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYPqi2"&gt;In one of its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, a YouTube representative gave a little more detail about how this particular feature will be deployed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="azF21n"&gt;We are experimenting with a new feature that displays a list of products detected in some videos, as well as related products. The feature will appear in between the recommended videos, to viewers scrolling below the video player. The goal is to help people explore more videos and information about those products on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mPQyKH"&gt;Presumably, it’s a move intended to give Google its own piece of the incredibly lucrative affiliate link market, while also tying commerce directly to video uploads. These lists could function as a second recommendation algorithm, with YouTube serving videos that feature similar products. It would also put YouTube in the same shopping space as other social platforms (like &lt;a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;). Who knows! As with most experiments, it’s a little up in the air — at least until the results come in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber David Dobrik parts ways with disposable camera app amidst controversy  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9uqrNM-SPFP29Fv-oIttrGaITk=/518x0:2357x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004826/Screen_Shot_2020_01_09_at_11.05.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dispo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlwDjQ"&gt;David Dobrik has parted ways with Dispo, the disposable camera app co-founded by the YouTuber in 2019, after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRnICq"&gt;“David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth,” Dispo said in a statement, “Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly — our community — stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heCs9t"&gt;Dobrik’s decision to leave Dispo follows a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which one of the women featured in a 2018 vlog said a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. She was 20 years old at the time, and said friends of Dobrik supplied her and her friends with alcohol as they were too young to buy it for themselves. Dobrik posted footage from the night of the incident in a video titled “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” which was later taken down at the request of the woman involved. “We’re all going to jail,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1372024094867091461"&gt;Dobrik said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VX6FWb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGng3h"&gt;On the same day as Dobrik’s departure from Dispo, venture capital firm Spark Capital announced that it was cutting ties with the company after leading its recent $20 million funding round. “In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company,” the firm tweeted, “We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTBnQS"&gt;Multiple sponsors have also either cut ties, or are reviewing their partnerships with Dobrik in light of the allegations. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/style/david-dobrik-youtube-explained.html?utm_content=buffer3b11f&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that sponsors including HelloFresh and Dollar Shave Club are no longer working with the YouTuber or his team. Dobrik’s main YouTube channel has lost over 100,000 subscribers after the allegations were made public, and Dispo’s App Store page was bombarded with negative ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bslsyH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.&lt;/p&gt;— Spark Capital (@sparkcapital) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197831720963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1mHN5"&gt;While Dobrik declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; on its report, he later published a video titled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=260IAJdFvl0"&gt;Let’s talk&lt;/a&gt;” in which he discussed the controversy in general terms. “I don’t agree with some of the videos I’ve posted,” he says in the video, adding that there’s “been moments where I’ve looked back on videos, and I realize that these don’t represent me anymore, and they’re hurtful to other people.” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on separate allegations about the YouTuber last month made by a former Vlog Squad member, which he addresses in the same apology video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnptLn"&gt;“I’ve been really disappointed in some of my friends, and for that reason I’ve separated from a lot of them,” Dobrik said. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Vlog Squad member accused of sexual assault stopped appearing in videos on Dobrik’s channel in late 2019. “Consent is something that’s super super important to me,” Dobrik said. “I’m sorry if I’ve let you down, and things like that won’t happen again and I’ve learned from my mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1icnm"&gt;Dispo is an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1491684197"&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt; designed to imitate the process of using a disposable camera. Photos it takes only become available at 9AM the following day, and can be ordered as prints directly from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfSDDp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SyKK3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ChilledCow puts channel name out to pasture with a rebrand to ‘Lofi Girl’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-MnZYJEXEbJLeF0IHbtTTpzti4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994340/40c40c35_3727_4939_b82b_2f1061b12197.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sTl5Zv"&gt;The hugely popular lo-fi music YouTube channel ChilledCow isn’t just known for its chill, cozy beats; the iconic animations of the girl sitting and working at her desk are instantly recognizable around the internet. (She’s even being turned into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22325348/youtooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine"&gt;one-foot-tall figurine&lt;/a&gt;.) And on Thursday, the channel’s sixth anniversary, ChilledCow fully embraced the icon by rebranding the channel to “Lofi Girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE44WU"&gt;“This was a very tough decision to make, but the driving force behind it is the fact that ChilledCow’s name was chosen many years ago, and is no longer reflective of what the channel is about anymore,” Lofi Girl said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023/photo/1"&gt;in a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EfKgsW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/hwfmZ9jACT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hwfmZ9jACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lofi Girl (@lofigirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ipX5pJ"&gt;The YouTube channel is indeed called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; now, and the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lofigirl"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts are @lofigirl. (The Instagram account is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chilledcow_yt/"&gt;still @chilledcow_yt&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe that will change soon.) Otherwise, the channel remains the same — there is still a live stream of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;soft electronic beats to work or relax to&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWcJFNfaw9c"&gt;second, mellower stream&lt;/a&gt;, if that’s what you’re in the mood for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT0mLJ"&gt;“Don’t worry, this change won’t affect in any way the content on the channel but will instead pave the way for many exciting projects for you all in the future!” Lofi Girl said. “The channel has been and always will be about music, art and positivity only.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Living the Dream SMP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BSH_bi9yL04bm9qxXrqZzhi_Lts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68993290/acastro_210318_4480_dreamSMP_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge | DreamSMP Recreation by Adya&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Inside the massive fandom making Dream SMP YouTube’s biggest hit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SlqBt7"&gt;Ollie was asleep at three in the morning when the Discord app on his phone started blowing up. He panicked; many of his friends lived in different time zones, but they knew how late it was for him. The only reason they’d be frantically messaging him in the middle of the night is if something terrible happened. Bolting awake, he checked his messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTa41R"&gt;“OLLIE, DREAM JUST GAVE YOU A SHOUTOUT ON TWITTER!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBXFkZ"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;DREAM SHOUTED YOU OUT!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ugEkJ"&gt;A high school student and artist, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; spends much of his free time&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt/status/1350250176733093889?s=21"&gt; making fan art&lt;/a&gt; about his favorite &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;streamers. Dream, arguably the main character in his &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;universe, known as Dream SMP, has more than 2.7 million followers on Twitter and nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube. So when Ollie saw Dream tell his followers to check out the art on his account, Ollie burst into tears. His own Twitter account went from around 8,000 followers to more than 13,000 followers in one night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wI9X82"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzD772"&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community,” Ollie told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over Discord. “Not because of the numbers that were coming through with the shoutout, but because of how many people I realized were around me, supporting me, and being such amazing friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9xtGg"&gt;Describing the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minecraft-dream-smp-political-drama/"&gt;story of Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt; to anyone not paying attention to every stream or YouTube upload can sound like a made-up language. Dream SMP (SMP stands for “survival multiplayer,” a type of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server) was&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;created by a YouTuber who goes by Dream. Over the last 18 months, Dream has invited other Twitch streamers and YouTube personalities — including TommyInnit, Tubbo, GeorgeNotFound, Punz, and several more — to join in. Together, they get into hijinxes, stage lengthy feuds, and pal around for a combined audience of tens of millions of people. Dream went from 1 million to 15 million subscribers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream/status/1344315641298366464"&gt;in one year alone&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is scripted and planned out, driving a larger story, but many of the reactions and circumstances are totally improvised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2nXIfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5R5uGG"&gt;Like a television show or cinematic universe, Dream SMP found its audience through a series of never-ending epic battles. The “Disc Saga” played &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPvdw7bOak&amp;amp;list=PL90zg3iCjs9LGwQ4DGNL2lfuPKIul4ApO"&gt;out over countless hours&lt;/a&gt;, turning a game of capture the flag (essentially) into a dramatic tale of good versus evil, as Dream and TommyInnit fought for dominance of the server. Once Wilbur Soot, a 24-year-old YouTuber from Britain and one of the main Dream SMP writers, joined in, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYTqgKWCuF0"&gt;he set up L’Manberg&lt;/a&gt; and created a space for a specific batch of creators. This eventually led to an all-out battle for independence with Dream that enraptured YouTube’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;audience. On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing, but it’s also the tiny, funny, and sweet moments that transform each streamer into a character worth rooting for — not unlike comic book heroes and villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLVUnP"&gt;The only thing more impressive than the elaborate world they’ve created is the fan base that’s sprung up around it. Dream SMP fanfiction writers dominate websites like Archive of Our Own, Dream SMP fan art can be found all over Tumblr and Twitter, and Dream SMP fan songs (including an entire in-the-works musical) get uploaded to YouTube. There is also a plethora of clip accounts that track Dream SMP stories for people who can’t tune in to each stream, full-blown fan-made animated episodes paying tribute to Dream SMP’s ongoing stories that air weekly on YouTube, and even a 24/7 news network devoted to tracking the universe’s story and hijinks. Dream SMP may exist on a tiny &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server, but thanks to a fan network stretching across the globe, it’s become a worldwide phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="HyFFHG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSoJshduVNo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eniGpc"&gt;Being a member of the Dream SMP community can sometimes feel like a full-time job. For Evan, it’s practically become one. At 16, he juggles attending school and working on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1mxOwASgWGYkvxN20-MBw"&gt;documentary-style videos for his channel&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each video is designed to provide an entertaining and accurate summary of the various lore that comes out of Dream SMP storylines, and a growing audience tunes in. Evan has nearly 400,000 subscribers, and his Dream SMP videos collect millions of views. Those videos can take Evan more than a month to complete; his last video took more than 120 hours alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEXoCK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Homework is essentially keeping me from working”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpLVyO"&gt;“I’m trying to balance videos and homework right now, but it’s weird because I find myself having to work on homework even when the videos make me significantly more money,” Evan told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on a phone call one night. “Obviously, I’m not making anything from school — I wish we got paid to go to school — but it’s like homework is essentially keeping me from working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1owFkz"&gt;Since the Dream SMP lore is constantly growing, a big part of Evan’s job is trying to piece it all together for newcomers who find his videos, hoping to catch up. In one video, Evan tries to keep track of each time Tommy and Dream stole discs (think CD-ROMs with music on them) from each other and hid said discs far within the block earth that makes up a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server. Evan makes it easy to follow, hitting just the right dramatic notes as the story progresses, but he says the work can be exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzLQB7"&gt;As Evan describes it, trying to summarize Dream SMP plots in the simplest way possible is like “trying to explain a movie to someone who’s never seen a movie before.” Evan has also run into newfound challenges that make the job harder. When the Dream SMP creators started streaming more on Twitch, it became more difficult to track down videos to watch after the fact. He, too, has to rely on WikiGuides from devoted fans and popular clips on Reddit to figure out what video he should focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mO4t2BgbSpNkKXs4fLjwUjXPHZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383094/ollie_dream.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dream fan art by Ollie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kbiaor"&gt;“The toughest parts to understand are what’s happening now,” Evan said. “Now, there will be points where there will be multiple streams happening at the exact same time, and both of them have really important stuff being added to the main story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5K8zs"&gt;With the Dream SMP creators posting fewer YouTube videos and documentarians like Evan taking additional time to get the videos just right, a need has developed for daily updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwLCpV"&gt;Sam, Claire, Kenzie, Mae, Alex, Lilja, and Boston make up a group of mostly teens who run &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate"&gt;DreamSMP Updates&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter account dedicated to updating fans on “who’s live, who’s on each other’s streams, when the members release something, an explanation on the storyline for when people miss live streams,” and more. Basically, it’s a one-stop shop for anyone looking to find up-to-the-minute information about their favorite streamers or check in on the big things that happened on stream if they weren’t able to watch. Sam started it in December, asking friends she met through the community to help out with the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0FOlVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a lot of responsibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bb6xBM"&gt;The group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over a Discord chat that it takes some coordination, but they’ve gotten to the point over the last several months where everyone knows what their role is within the team. It’s a huge responsibility, one that every member takes on without asking for any kind of payment in return. People expect everything to be right 100 percent of the time, Claire said, adding, “We have a lot of responsibility to be the person that people need.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZHd2Q"&gt;Work is divided into sections (often grouped by platforms), and those can change day to day, Alex said. Someone handles keeping up with YouTube uploads, merchandise updates from each creator, ensuring the Twitch bot doesn’t flail when streamers go live, keeping fans updated with creator appearances in separate streamers, etc. Claire and Boston mostly handle tweeting explanations of what happened on the stream and how it pertains to ongoing lore. (“Puffy says she does believe Dream is wrong, that its good he’s in Prison, that he deserves the punishment,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate/status/1371324394174222337"&gt;one recent update reads&lt;/a&gt;.) Boston keeps an eye on what’s happening, tweeting updates when needed, while also jotting down live notes about every new lore development. It’s a complicated operation — one the team does because of their love for Dream SMP creators and the community in which they found one another as friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYSZa3"&gt;“One of my favorite things to do on the account is look at DMs and talk to people in DMs,” Kenzie said. “When I see people thanking us for the account, it makes me feel good that I’m helping people out and doing something for the community. That’s probably what motivates me to continue running the account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="CYf4xg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh4E1VB0iS4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aV6o0m"&gt;Even after the &lt;a href="https://dreamteam.fandom.com/wiki/Category:SMP_members"&gt;30 or so Dream SMP members&lt;/a&gt; have signed off, fans keep expanding its world. Archive of Our Own, one of the biggest fanfiction sites, is home to &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Video%20Blogging%20RPF/works"&gt;nearly 106,000 works&lt;/a&gt; listed under Video Blogging RPF (fanfiction about real streamers and vloggers). The biggest fandom under that umbrella is &lt;em&gt;Minecraft. &lt;/em&gt;Wattpad has just under 34,000 works listed under “Dream SMP,” and Tumblr is full of many more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HTnwM"&gt;At one point, fans of the saga “Heat Waves,” one of the most viral Dream SMP fan stories, thought they crashed Archive of Our Own when rushing to read a new chapter. The site’s downtime was just a coincidence, but “Heat Waves” at the time was the “third most kudosed fic on the site,” an administrator told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Adi Robertson. (Kudos are equivalent to a like on Facebook.) The story became so popular that the Glass Animals song “Heat Waves,” which inspired the name of the story, crept into the Hottest 100 tracks in Australia last year, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/hottest-100-win-glass-animals-heat-waves-feature-minecraft-fic/13086032"&gt;partially thanks to the fanfiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kSMHoJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Dream SMP narrative isn’t fan service; it’s “collaborative storytelling”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhPpCr"&gt;What’s helped to propel that community is the way Dream SMP has incorporated it into the stories that actually play out on their server. During one arc, fans started using the phrase “welcome home, Theseus” in their art, essays, and songs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJPvgIMqPYo"&gt;comparing Tommy to the Greek hero&lt;/a&gt; who was exiled. Eventually, the Dream SMP streamer Technoblade actually used the line. “I screamed so loudly I probably did permanent damage to the hearing of the brother sitting next to me,” as one fan, who goes by Teahound, &lt;a href="https://tea-with-veth.tumblr.com/post/637703569706008576/so-technoblade-said-welcome-home-theseus-and-i"&gt;wrote on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO5i12"&gt;“I decided to write about how the Dream SMP is a brilliant example of how to do fan service properly,” Teahound continued. “But actually, what is happening on the SMP cannot be described as fanservice. It’s collaborative storytelling in it’s best form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBhRvu"&gt;The community wouldn’t continue to thrive if there wasn’t a plethora of fans celebrating and boosting people’s work.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Usually, big fandoms are kind of toxic in some aspects. But this community genuinely respects the content creators, and we all genuinely support each other,” Ali Tyler, a college student who has helped create an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjx0jDUp8lkhS7-Y0PZDwCw"&gt;entire musical based on the Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt;, said in a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NE5zfu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOcNHB"&gt;Fan creations are mostly positive, but there are more controversial sectors where critics argue a line is crossed. Because the streamers are real people, the stories have faced criticism for sexual depictions of everyday people. “Heat Waves” focuses on Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two prominent members of the Dream SMP world, as they dance around their feelings for each other. In real life, they’re just good friends. But in fanfiction, they often become much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCRym"&gt;The majority of writers contributing to the Dream SMP fanfiction community “hate to see real people’s boundaries being crossed as well,” says Xetera, who writes real-person fiction within the Dream SMP universe. Newer writers “tend to ask for forgiveness rather than permission,” and that’s something the community tries to push back against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vxy5J"&gt;“I believe people fight over boundaries more than trying to listen when creators speak,” Xetera said over Discord, noting that “when people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT688e"&gt;At the center of all of these stories — the artists, writers, YouTube editors, and musical producers — is the community. Beyond the creators they watch, it’s the friends they make, feeling like they’re a part of this rapidly expanding and immersive moment in internet culture. It’s a world all their own, and they want to contribute their little section to the overarching narrative in any way that they can. For Ollie, the first artist that Dream ever gave a shoutout to on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream__Fanart/status/1347874095485104129"&gt;from his dedicated Dream fan art account&lt;/a&gt; and who wants to pay it forward by giving new artists their chance in the spotlight, that’s everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Dh21T6"&gt;“If it weren’t for the community that we’ve built, the Dream SMP wouldn’t have the same charm that it does,” Ollie said. “And I think the creators know that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE558s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKEg89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MatPat looks at YouTube’s biggest changes over the last decade — and what lies ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvXGQanwptuwOgOzAzx9tzscYMQ=/360x0:4248x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992875/MatPat_headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An interview with one of gaming’s longest-standing personalities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MYWjNx"&gt;Matthew &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameTheorists/videos"&gt;“MatPat”&lt;/a&gt; Patrick was on YouTube for two years before he hit publish on the first entry in the series that changed his life — and YouTube culture as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNJwRl"&gt;“Game Theory,” a series that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Med6Z8-9g"&gt;examines the ins and outs&lt;/a&gt; of popular video game franchises like &lt;em&gt;Five Nights at Freddy’s &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, premiered on April 18th, 2011. The channel quickly found an audience of gaming enthusiasts and industry developers who wanted to learn the secrets behind why certain games became such a hit. YouTubers also looked to him as a model, as Patrick successfully helped to pilot an entire genre of videos, using tricks he had learned while working behind the scenes at a multichannel network (an older YouTube model that has slowly faded away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSlhGp"&gt;Throughout the years, MatPat’s channel became a go-to open secret for new YouTube creators and game developers. He was one of the first creators to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996849/minecraft-youtube-rewind-fortnite-grand-theft-auto-roblox-biggest-games-views"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was so successful on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example. By 2017, he became a leading figure within the community, fighting on behalf of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators"&gt;YouTubers during the “adpocalypse.”&lt;/a&gt; He even went on to host an interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ap6PTQUMf4"&gt;session with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki&lt;/a&gt; about creator issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJyfMQ"&gt;In 2014,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Patrick expanded “Game Theory” into a franchise &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmTheorists"&gt;with “Film Theory,”&lt;/a&gt; and “Food Theory” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYoe8kQ-7Gn9ASOlmI0k6Q"&gt;followed just last year&lt;/a&gt;. His videos routinely pick up millions of views, and he employs a full team to help with editing and creating new episodes. Alongside his wife and channel partner Stephanie, the two are also exploring more charity live streams for causes close to their hearts. In December 2020, one of their charity streams &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2020-fundraising-news/game-theory-raises-3-million-on-youtube.html"&gt;raised more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMi2nN"&gt;With the 10th anniversary of Game Theory approaching, Patrick sat down with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for an interview about what’s changed on YouTube over the last decade and what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy4waT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wqb5zi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9BNqktRdLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="9hmIxS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question, which is maybe a big one, but in these last 10 years, what’s the biggest thing that has changed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unqf8s"&gt;Oh, well! [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] It’s pretty massive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNtZVL"&gt;I think the biggest stuff is the idea of being a YouTuber, and being a creator, has fundamentally shaped so much of entertainment, of being a storyteller — of the world ecosystem, in a lot of cases. The idea that anyone with a phone in their hand can not just create something but find an audience somewhere in the millions or tens of millions, and ultimately build a business off of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys1gbR"&gt;That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform. You’re giving rise to stories like the Dream SMP, which no television producer in their right mind would ever think to greenlight or understand why it could be so popular — and yet, it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom"&gt;biggest thing happening on YouTube right now.&lt;/a&gt; That sort of fostering of creativity, that explosion of being able to tell your own story is really exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsCcAT"&gt;You see those ripple effects happening, too. In the way that the lead shows, especially during COVID, had to film at home and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21179793/coronavirus-late-night-fallon-colbert-wwe-morning-shows-the-view-sports-premier-league-nba-mlb"&gt;become vloggers in their own right&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming has permeated the sports world in a way that 10 years ago would have never existed. Even the evolution of live content, as celebrities kind of tried to try to find their own audiences outside of their individual projects... they’re following the models that YouTubers and digital creators have been pioneering over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMImnV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You inspired a lot of people to kind of figure out a way to do those types of videos [theories and in-depth explainers] that are really influential and informative. When did you start noticing, like, “Ah, this thing I created is taking off to the point that people want to replicate it?” Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2A2nQ"&gt;We were one of the early video essay formats. From the YouTube creator standpoint, I think it was probably about three years into us doing the show that I first started to really take note that other people were attempting the format. I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce3"&gt;think it was VSauce3&lt;/a&gt;, the pop culture science channel, which was massive at the time. I remember thinking, “Oh, that’s my format. And they’re doing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVqCUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ow5n5r"&gt;That was also the first time that I got really scared. We were still in relatively early days, still finding our audience, and here’s this massive channel that is doing roughly the thing that we’ve been doing for the past three years — hopefully they don’t run us out or whatever. But what we came to learn very quickly was there’s an audience that is big enough for everyone, and everyone kind of tackles that theorizing format in their own unique voice, which is really exciting. You now have a community of theorists all applying their logic in different ways and can create complimentary content, as opposed to content that cannibalizes each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="130T7c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a different version of 2021, if Game Theory didn’t exist, if someone were to come to you and say, “I have this idea for this channel I want to do,” would that be able to find an audience today? Is there room for Game Theory today or is that something that had to happen at the moment it did?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV3pE0"&gt;It sounds a little bit defeatist, but I think it had to kind of happen when it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az1BYZ"&gt;The nature of theorizing does not work well with the modern ecosystem of digital video. Having thoughtful analytical pieces that take a week to put together like our videos doesn’t run with the speed that the internet runs with at this point. Doing this sort of research piece, it’s just hard to do. And you see that too even with educational channels in the space, right? The channels that have been able to survive in 2020 / 2021 are the established ones: the VSauces of the world, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicswoman"&gt;Physics Girls of the world&lt;/a&gt;. These channels that can afford to have a little bit of a delay between their uploads because their audience is already there. That affords them the time to do the research, to do the scripting, to make sure that their facts are correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzhhZP"&gt;If you’re looking to kind of get some sort of accelerated growth on the platform, that requires a faster cadence of uploads or being able to more closely ride trends. A single creator, doing all the steps on their own, would really struggle to do all of it in the time it takes to be competitive in that landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfFf69N4dKdcN4h1ihadq9g9HfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380163/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.52.33_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N98AHi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the future of gaming videos? Is it more Dream SMP stuff? Or is there a place where people can still do let’s plays and all that with games when YouTube is trying to figure out how to keep advertising going and keep the children’s privacy law COPPA in mind? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKq3VD"&gt;Gaming is stronger than it’s ever been. In 2020, gaming was one of the few fields that didn’t just sustain itself but thrived as more people found gaming to fill in the gaps that the disappearance of reality kind of left in its wake. A lot of people had these gaps in their schedules, gaps in social calendars, and gaming was able to kind of fill those holes. People were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200972/college-students-graduation-minecraft-coronavirus-school-closures"&gt;having graduations in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people were going to the museum in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. Gaming kind of exploded in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mviDZx"&gt;I think Dream SMP is definitely one route. It’s not just gaming, it’s narrative storytelling through the lens of gaming. You’re starting to see more people kind of adopt that Machinima idea of, “Hey, here’s a world in which I can treat this not as a game, but as a platform.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is doing it a lot of ways to where they have the creative block where you can create whatever you want. That’s really cool. Game developers are recognizing that the game doesn’t end when a player beats it or when the match ends, but it can become an ecosystem, a platform of its own to foster the creativity of its players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="499XjQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has always had that. That’s one of the reasons why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has had such staying power. You’re seeing other gaming companies recognizing this and trying to build in that direction. I can see that being the direction of where gaming content moves from here. It’s less about sitting down on the couch and playing through this narrative story time together, and more sitting down on the couch and creating a world together using the tools of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge1Dg6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like the term “YouTuber” now comes with more authority and more respect than it did in 2011? From your perspective, as someone who is an entrepreneur as well as a creator, how have those conversations changed with industry people that you meet when you say, “I’m on YouTube, I’m a YouTuber?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J1rCA"&gt;I think, for a long time, there was this kind of an attempt to educate traditional media about that exact issue. That being a YouTuber wasn’t a dirty word, right? There is a specific connotation attached to that, like a certain tier of creator — an upper tier of creator who is delivering this interesting content. But I think a lot of times, myself included, we got frustrated that a lot of times those conversations tended to fall on deaf ears. The learning process was slower than we hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl3Lwl"&gt;Nowadays, in 2021, it’s one of those things where there’s a division of people who get it and people who don’t. Rather than trying to prove credibility to the people who don’t, the industry is just moving forward. You either get it or you don’t. This is where there is still a division in the ecosystem, people who still don’t respect it or who still kind of look down on the title of YouTuber. But the need to kind of prove that legitimacy has kind of faded away. There’s enough critical movement in the ecosystem, in the traditional space, in the brand space, that it’s like I will find the people who understand me and respect me and move forward with them. If you don’t hop on the train, well, you’re just gonna get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoWt6e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I often think about not just how much has changed since 2011, but things that I miss from that era. There was a moment of true experimentation for an online video platform. I miss that. There are other things that I don’t miss. It was chaotic, and not always in a good way. Is there anything that you miss about that specific era? And is there anything from that specific era of YouTube that has kind of gone away that you’re happy about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWQjJV"&gt;In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West. You were able to kind of produce videos on any game, any topic, and there wasn’t a pressure for that upload to perform or there wasn’t an expectation of earning money off of it. You did get a lot of really interesting, really off-the-wall experimental videos that were true expressions of a person’s creativity and you saw stuff unlike anything you would see elsewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TUpkE"&gt;The window of what is acceptable to put on YouTube has really narrowed. You have regulations on one side dictating what isn’t kids’ content, you have rampant demonetization dictating what can or can’t be said or shown in a particular video. There is a certain level of polish that modern YouTube kind of expects of videos for them to kind of get a decent amount of traction on the platform. You lose a lot of the rawness — the bad cameras, the wonky editing, the YouTube slideshows of yesteryear — because the platform does have a standard of quality now that it’s looking to show to audiences around the world. And I understand why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmCyoi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZSCsI"&gt;But something does get lost for small creators who are still using this as a platform to kind of find their voice, find their audience. I definitely miss that. I miss that idea of community, that idea of anything goes, that idea of chaos. It’s a double-edged sword. As we talked about before, what it means to be a YouTuber is less stigmatized, there is a group of people who understand it. So the ability to build a business on YouTube on one hand is kind of a bummer because it’s no longer one person in the Wild West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tyot3"&gt;Now at the very least, I have stability. We’re going on 10 years, and I think for the first five of them, we operated under the motto that this bubble could burst at that moment. The algorithm could shift, advertisers could leave, YouTube could get shut down. Now, YouTube, the ecosystem, how it’s perceived in the world has evolved in such a way that this is a more stable place to build a business. Advertisers come and go, and you will have your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231561/youtube-child-exploitation-predators-controversy-creators-adpocalypse"&gt;occasional adpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, but the system has matured in such a way that paranoia of always having to look over your shoulder has started to ebb away a little bit, and you’re able to focus on running your own race and making the stuff that you are able to produce as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQR54O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is something that you’ve seen go around, assumptions that people make, that people actually get wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihJBcA"&gt;There’s a stigma that comes with anyone who’s kind of built out their team and has been public about it. The idea of, “Oh, this isn’t your channel anymore because you have an editor and a researcher, or you have someone who helps you upload the videos.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrCWY"&gt;What’s exciting to me is that it allows us to do what we love to do at a larger scale and actually stay relevant in 2021 with the kind of faster pace that YouTube expects at this point. Not only that, but also employ like-minded individuals who also are creative and have something that they want to say, or who are theorists like me, who have their own properties that they want to talk about. What a lot of people see is, “Oh, you became corporate” or we became a business. Yeah, we became a business, but that doesn’t lose the core of the creativity that brought us here in the first place. In fact, it’s enabled us to empower other creatives like ourselves to find employment doing the stuff that they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAG4r3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, last question, and it might be a little tougher. What’s next for you? Is there a future beyond YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxv0sb"&gt;We just launched Food Theory, and that’s been a lot of fun. That’s been really creatively refreshing for us. You can theorize about things that don’t just exist in the pop culture lexicon, you can theorize about anything in your day-to-day life. We have some thoughts as to what else you can theorize about, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that one fill in at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7cwe"&gt;Our main focus now is doing exactly what we talked about: being an influencer of influencers where we are trying to advocate to YouTube on behalf of creators’ rights and needs. We’re trying to find solutions for channels that are having trouble with monetization, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;having trouble with COPPA&lt;/a&gt; or things like that to try and help them be able to find the stability that we’ve been able to find. Finding business solutions and creator solutions that work for this kind of next generation of creators. We’ve been really working behind the scenes to make those tools available to creators so that way they can grow their own businesses faster and not have to make mistakes that we made along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s8PwKS"&gt;The last thing is our charitable work. At the end of last year, we had the amazing ability to raise $3 million for St. Jude along with the help of 50 of our favorite creators across various platforms. We see the importance of using the platform that we’ve been given, that we’re lucky enough to have built over the years, for good. If we can kind of pay it forward and pass along that goodwill and serve as an ambassador for worthwhile causes in order to inspire the next generation of creators to make good use of the fortunate position they’ve been given, that’s great as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inexplicably, YouTube says extremely racist Steven Crowder video isn’t hate speech</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMiIyo"&gt;YouTube removed an extremely racist video from conservative commentator Steven Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336028/youtube-steven-crowder-racist-video-removed-covid-misinformation-policies"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, citing violations of the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy — not its hate speech policy — as the reason for the removal. Inexplicably, though, the video did not violate the company’s hate speech policies at all, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/youtube-explains-why-a-racist-video-didnt-violate-its-hate-speech-rules-3d74befde097"&gt;the company told &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, despite Crowder and his co-hosts making numerous racist comments about Black farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5i4jZ"&gt;“Our hate speech policy prohibits content promoting hatred against groups based on their race,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;. “While offensive, this video from the Steven Crowder channel does not violate this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2R1pw"&gt;If you were curious, here is &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en"&gt;YouTube’s full hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to hear the offensive comments from Crowder’s show, &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt; clipped them in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. I will warn you that they are awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGsF9f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On YouTube, Steven Crowder and his co-hosts go on a wildly racist tirade against Black farmers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch"&gt;https://t.co/dbnKNN2Lch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iUsm2hjknb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iUsm2hjknb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1371856007203336194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQNDpd"&gt;This means YouTube has a ridiculously high bar for hate speech, as &lt;em&gt;OneZero’s&lt;/em&gt; Will Oremus points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="e864"&gt;You’re free to mock, caricature, and belittle people based on their race, just as long as you don’t come right out and say you literally hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2TH1sT"&gt;While you could argue that YouTube’s just enforcing the policies it has, not the policies you might want, remember that YouTube has the ability to change those policies whenever it likes. That’s what it did &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-ongoing-work-to-tackle-hate"&gt;nearly two years ago in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, updating its hate speech policy “by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities” including race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fUiQU"&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;mean that hate speech doesn’t have to rise to the level of “promoting hatred” (the language YouTube used to &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;) to result in a policy violation, or to stop promoting Crowder as a YouTube Partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27XT0F"&gt;Speaking of which, YouTube &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; said in that 2019 post that it would take action on hate speech that comes “right up to the line” as well, warning that “Channels that repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies will be suspended from the YouTube Partner program.” In 2020, after Crowder’s YouTube Partner status was originally reinstated, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it would “take appropriate action” if there were more violations on his channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BMPCr"&gt;What will it take now?&lt;/p&gt;
