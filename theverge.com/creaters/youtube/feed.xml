    <title>Google goes nuclear against Roku by adding YouTube TV to the main YouTube app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pb5quvxP-CvBjZR-tuSKdVLlwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253022/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ty3nbu"&gt;A week after their broken-down negotiations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;spilled into the public&lt;/a&gt;, Google and Roku still haven’t been able to reach a deal to renew YouTube TV’s presence on the huge streaming platform. But Google has come up with something of a workaround in the meantime: it’s going to let people access YouTube TV directly from the main YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdp0O4"&gt;YouTube users will start seeing a “Go to YouTube TV” option in the main YouTube app over the next few days. When they select that, they’ll then be switched over to the standard YouTube TV user experience. This option is coming to Roku devices first — where it’s currently most needed — but will also come to YouTube on other platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60xc5D8nnFQBEoj2MbMl-dfkvQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498898/Untitled_presentation__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV6Aw"&gt;In essence, Google has basically stuffed the YouTube TV app into YouTube itself, a solution that seems unlikely to make Roku very happy. Google says it’s “still working to come to an agreement with Roku to ensure continued access to YouTube TV for our mutual customers,” and it notes the YouTube TV app remains usable for those who already have it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5repmz"&gt;But in the event that things totally fall apart, Google says it’s “in discussions with other partners to secure free streaming devices in case YouTube TV members face any access issues on Roku.” A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this workaround is only for consumption of YouTube TV; customers cannot sign up for new subscriptions through the YouTube app at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ykhp1d"&gt;In a statement on Friday afternoon, Roku responded to Google’s latest move by calling the company “an unchecked monopolist.” Roku also criticized Google’s decision to bundle the services together as an example of its “predatory business practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csdrIx"&gt;Here’s Roku’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tZb47w"&gt;Google’s actions are the clear conduct of an unchecked monopolist bent on crushing fair competition and harming consumer choice. The bundling announcement by YouTube highlights the kind of predatory business practices used by Google that Congress, Attorney Generals and regulatory bodies around the world are investigating. Roku has not asked for one additional dollar in financial value from YouTubeTV. We have simply asked Google to stop their anticompetitive behavior of manipulating user search results to their unique financial benefit and to stop demanding access to sensitive data that no other partner on our platform receives today. In response, Google has continued its practice of blatantly leveraging its YouTube monopoly to force an independent company into an agreement that is both bad for consumers and bad for fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sIHVNm"&gt;Google said on Friday that it’s “in ongoing, long-term conversations with Roku to certify that new devices meet our technical requirements,” yet more confirmation that the company is insisting hardware makers implement support for AV1 decoding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YFfmZc"&gt;This certification process exists to ensure a consistent and high-quality YouTube experience across different devices, including Google’s own — so you know how to navigate the app and what to expect. We’ll continue our conversations with Roku on certification, in good faith, with the goal of advocating for our mutual customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4fqUlP"&gt;Roku has argued that Google’s requirements are unreasonable and will lead to higher prices for its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0gUJY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 7th 3:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated to include comment from Roku.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The David After Dentist meme is now an NFT — and yes, this is real life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYllnBTe1b6vsmIGd4px1h2g1HE=/0x45:1331x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248508/david_dentist.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David After Dentist is now an NFT | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs&amp;amp;ab_channel=booba1234" target="_blank"&gt;David Devore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P5ZSWh"&gt;David DeVore was seven years old in 2008 when a trip to the dentist left him feeling “funny” afterward. His dad, David Sr., recorded his son’s post-anesthesia musings (“Is this real life?” “You have four eyes” “I feel funny”), and when he uploaded it to YouTube a few months later — intending to share it with friends and family — the video went viral within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqvHPR"&gt;Now, 140 million views and 11 years later, David After Dentist is becoming the latest mid-2000s meme to go up for auction as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CydfH4"&gt;“It kind of feels like 2009 all over again,” the elder DeVore said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “NFTs are like the wild west right now, it’s like back when we went viral and social media was in its infancy.” &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/davidafterdentist"&gt;The auction for the David NFT&lt;/a&gt; goes live today, and DeVore said he expects it will conclude sometime on Friday afternoon. (It’s officially open for 24 hours but could be extended for late bids.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zp4x00"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txqiwrbYGrs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SELTRh"&gt;DeVore says while his family dealt with their share of trolls — some who questioned his parenting — the meme has been a positive thing for their family, helping pay for his kids’ tuition. He didn’t get into the latest amounts, but he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-they-now-david-after-dentist-family-rolling-in-150000-2010-6"&gt;estimated in a 2010 interview&lt;/a&gt; that the family had made $150,000 in merchandise, licensing, and from YouTube revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wugDn"&gt;Compared to other creators of that era like Disaster Girl and Nyan Cat, he said he felt lucky he was able to retain some control of the meme. “They had less control, if any at all,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W3gRl"&gt;But those creators are seeing things come full circle now as well. Disaster Girl, whose real name is Zoe Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;went for $500,000&lt;/a&gt;, and Nyan Cat’s creator Chris Torres sold &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html"&gt;it for nearly $600,000&lt;/a&gt;. A ton of classic memes from back in the day have been auctioned as NFTs, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-luck-brian-meme-nft-crypto-art-blockchain-ethereum-foundation-2021-3"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/grumpycat/grumpy-cat-5467"&gt;Grumpy Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/keyboardcat/play-him-off-keyboard-cat-5553"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4sDdH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6iZwQe"&gt;David Jr. is 20 now and attending the University of Florida where he’s studying computer science (not dentistry, to this writer’s disappointment), and he has perfect teeth, his dad says. The response to the NFT has been mostly positive, DeVore Sr. added, in part because the creator economy has become more sophisticated since David After Dentist debuted more than a decade ago. “I think it plays into the strong empathy people have for creators,” he said. “People want to see them get rewarded.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use YouTube’s gestures to make it bearable on a portrait-locked phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q307eboRfSUaBnFCcv-HVqoUQxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247427/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAzW1U"&gt;If you use your phone in portrait lock all the time, it can be frustrating trying to get YouTube videos into full screen with the tiny button in the UI. Thankfully, there’s a better way, using the app’s built-in gestures: you can simply swipe up on a video to fill up the screen and swipe down on it to go back to portrait orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT3nco"&gt;We’ve actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534349/youtube-mobile-app-gestures-swipe-full-screen-closed-caption-autoplay-buttons-update-new"&gt;written about this feature before&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it’s easy to miss; most of the people I’ve shown it to had no idea it existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDRctFnkzboC5cruqwsHWl-1woY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496515/DSCF2152_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VEAmmz"&gt;Of course, this feature works on Android phones as well, which I personally like better than having to hit the auto-rotate button built into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8vMAO"&gt;There is one obvious limitation: it only rotates one way. If you want to hold your phone with the left side facing up, you’re out of luck unless you turn portrait lock off. Still, it’s way better than having to tap on the video once to get the UI controls to show up, then trying to hit the tiny full-screen button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZws6q"&gt;Now all we need is this feature to be added to every other app (or for our phones to get smart enough to realize that if I’m watching a video and turn my phone, I probably want to see the video in full-screen, despite portrait lock). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 now has a YouTube TV app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25Ntq96TzeZMldyEVsk0uaDDiOo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246380/vpavic_4261_20201023_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxBn52"&gt;The PlayStation 5 &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129767#zippy=%2Cmobile-devices-computers%2Cstreaming-media-players-smart-tvs-game-consoles"&gt;now has a YouTube TV app&lt;/a&gt;, arriving more than six months after the console launched. That means anyone lucky enough to actually buy Sony’s latest console now has another way to watch live TV on it, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/05/youtube-tv-arrives-on-ps5-just-in-time-to-pick-up-ex-roku-viewers/"&gt;as first spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MSOBJ"&gt;YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;costs $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; (not counting additional extras) and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7286228?hl=en"&gt;allows up to three simultaneous streams&lt;/a&gt; within a household, which could be useful if your PS5 is hooked up in another room from your main TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5pLr1"&gt;Having another device that works with YouTube TV could be especially helpful for Roku owners, given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;ongoing feud between Google and Roku&lt;/a&gt; that has seen YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from Roku’s channel store&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Roku owners can’t install or re-download the app if they don’t already have it on their device.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOOF1t"&gt;Admittedly, the Venn diagram of “PS5 owners who subscribe to YouTube TV and also own a Roku device that didn’t already have the YouTube TV app” is certainly vanishing small. But in a world where corporate disputes can mean losing access to the services you pay for on the devices you already own at the drop of a hat, having more streaming options is never a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are the royals going to vlog?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4hjAa59jgcx2xVGIXoXxO3742Q=/227x0:2651x1616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243414/williamkatevlog.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0s0rf"&gt;The young attractive royal couple that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Harry and Meghan has dropped a truly chaotic intro video for their shiny new official YouTube channel. In the video, the presumed future queen and king of the United Kingdom (also known as Kate Middleton and Kate Middleton’s husband) laugh and chat awkwardly in what looks like their home. It’s well-lit but not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;well-lit: a reasonably good YouTuber rig but not exactly one of royal magnificence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apz9rO"&gt;“Be careful what you’re saying, these guys are going to start filming,” says Prince William to his smiling wife, as though she doesn’t know how cameras work. The general feel of the clip is the first few seconds after a camera starts rolling but before the YouTube stars start vlogging in earnest. Except they don’t vlog. The video then cuts to what can only be described as a hype reel of public appearances at public functions or at their various charities — not exactly an exclusive glimpse of the royals at home. Where is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Where are the chickens?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hiV7oo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is this new channel even for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YE3MjR"&gt;It’s not as though Will and Kate’s new channel is going to be a royal pioneer in the world of awkward webcam recordings with dubious production values. For one thing, it looks like they’ve invested in an actual setup. For another thing, the British royal family — as an official, monolithic institution — has had a YouTube channel since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/23/youtube.monarchy"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. And for the past year, while much of the world has been in lockdown, the channel has become replete with recordings of Zoom meetings. From such bangers as “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge host bingo” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_6tCpOllPw&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;100K views&lt;/a&gt;) to less inspired videos like “The Earl of Wessex joins a video call with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQaEOEz780&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;4.8K views&lt;/a&gt;), the House of Windsor has been very busy addressing the masses from their laptops, at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i1X4Z"&gt;So will the Cambridges vlog or won’t they? What is this new channel even for? And what’s the deal with their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/meghan-markle-instagram.html"&gt;weird Instagram follower count&lt;/a&gt;, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7biSAY"&gt;It’s impossible not to connect this latest foray into the world of #creator #platforms with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;bombshell interview&lt;/a&gt; with Oprah or to contrast it with that other couple’s deals with Netflix and Spotify. The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-fighting-drama-rumors.html"&gt;supposed bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between the princes and their wives might be more tabloid projection than reality, but it’s at least true that one couple is set to one day succeed to the throne, while the other has dealt the British monarchy a blow as severe as the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/princess-diana-martin-bashir-interview"&gt;1995 Princess Diana interview&lt;/a&gt; with Martin Bashir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SmL5t0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CYICv"&gt;Is the new Will and Kate YouTube channel a response to the burgeoning Harry / Meghan media empire? Is it a bid for independence from the British tabloid press? Or is it just the Kensington Palace comms team trying out something new that will wind up just as anodyne and dull as the rest of the royal family’s internet presence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfTNmw"&gt;In truth, it’s bizarre that the British royal family is just barely keeping up with the newest changes in the media landscape. A dysfunctional rich family whose sole purpose in life is to be famous? The Windsors were influencers before they were &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britains-king-george-v-changes-royal-surname"&gt;called the Windsors&lt;/a&gt; and long before being an influencer was even a thing. How is their entire brand still in the grip of the tabloids? It’s like the royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIJ7d"&gt;Of course, previous attempts at the “Royals: They’re Just Like Us” narrative have been met with mixed results. On the one hand, these behind-the-scenes-type video treatments have always done gangbusters in television ratings. On the other hand, the family has uniformly hated and despised these documentaries, like the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/uk/royal-family-1969-documentary-youtube-scli-gbr-intl/index.html"&gt;hilariously awkward 1969 BBC documentary&lt;/a&gt; depicting the everyday life of the royals, which is rumored to have been banned by the queen, though not until after approximately 350 million people viewed it worldwide. (The documentary made its way onto YouTube earlier this year and was quickly taken down via copyright notice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YlyY01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CiTCy"&gt;Then there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/prince-charles-in-tv-documentary-admits-to-infidelity.html"&gt;1994 ITV documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Prince Charles (you know, the one who married Diana) that was so disastrous for his image that a subsequent poll by &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; found that two-thirds of respondents did not want Charles to succeed as the next king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmTwk2"&gt;Will and Kate’s request for people to like and subscribe is the latest in a weighty media legacy spanning from Edward VIII’s abdication radio broadcast to Elizabeth II’s televised coronation to the tabloid warfare that Prince William’s own parents waged against each other before his mother’s untimely death while chased by paparazzi looking to feed the content mill. Given this history, it’s understandable why the couple’s online presence in all things is so tightly controlled. However, restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success, and the royal family’s reticence and general fear of candor is exactly one of the reasons why the Meghan / Harry and Oprah interview was such a wild success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RURbq1"&gt;But who’s to say how things will turn out after all? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are, essentially, taxpayer-funded celebrities. Surely, they’ve put more thought into this than we have. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new originals starring Will Smith and Alicia Keys  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3snEN5Uw3pl39bB5UkHWbkXWGQ=/233x0:2180x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235189/will_smith_brandcast.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Will Smith has a new fitness show coming to YouTube. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="we1uTI"&gt;YouTube announced a new slate of original series today that includes some huge stars at the top of the lineup. Will Smith will star in a six-part reality series about fitness and “returning his body into the best shape of his life,” and a four-part series will go behind the scenes with Alicia Keys as she records a new album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHJ3vY"&gt;The new lineup of originals also includes a third season of Liza Koshy’s &lt;em&gt;Liza on Demand&lt;/em&gt;; a new special focused on Asian American chefs, celebrities, activists, and creators that counts LeBron James and Michelle Kwan as executive producers; and a new special called &lt;em&gt;Barbershop Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that explores the intersection of race and socioeconomic status that came out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt; that was announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbNkvi"&gt;YouTube has regularly changed up its approach to original content since it started making originals about five years ago. They started out as subscriber-only shows centered around creators, pivoted to ad-supported shows featuring mainstream stars like Kevin Hart and Will Smith (making this his second&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;YouTube original), and more recently have delivered more of a mix of the two, with most shows being largely available to anyone who visits YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNjwKD"&gt;Still, big names like Will Smith and Alicia Keys guarantee views, and they provide credibility to YouTube and comfort for advertisers who may be worried about some of the platform’s wilder content. These series were, not coincidentally, announced in the middle of a YouTube presentation for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkpXdM"&gt;Will Smith’s new series will debut next year; Alicia Keys’ arrives this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku removes YouTube TV from channel store as dispute with Google escalates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aq1tMjfCzmPCYzzYmNYMRKoe0rw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69211454/cwelch_20210428_4565_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fhxoz3"&gt;Roku has pulled YouTube TV from its channel store. The distribution agreement between Roku and Google for YouTube TV has expired as of today — and the two sides haven’t been able to reach a new deal. However, Roku says it is “taking the extra step to continue to offer existing subscribers access to YouTube TV on the Roku platform unless Google takes actions that require the full removal of the channel.” New subscriptions from the YouTube TV app have also been switched off “until an agreement is reached.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oijh6b"&gt;In an email to customers, Roku warned “it is also important that you do not delete the YouTube TV app as it will not be available for download to Roku devices.” The regular YouTube app is unaffected by this situation and remains freely available on Roku devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68iHaA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;Roku has accused Google&lt;/a&gt; of seeking unfair terms that would adversely affect streaming competitors and benefit the YouTube suite of apps. Google has also asked for deeper access to Roku customer data than other services, Roku claims, and is pushing Roku to adopt new hardware requirements; presumably the company is aiming to get AV1 supported in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qipS6m"&gt;“We have only asked Google for four simple commitments,” Roku said in a new statement today. “First, not to manipulate consumer search results. Second, not to require access to data not available to anyone else. Third, not to leverage their YouTube monopoly to force Roku to accept hardware requirements that would increase consumer costs. Fourth, not to act in a discriminatory and anticompetitive manner against Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXilMH"&gt;Earlier this week, Google accused Roku of abusing its strong position in the streaming hardware market. “Roku often engages in these types of tactics in their negotiations. We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations,” a Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. “All of our work with them has been focused on ensuring a high quality and consistent experience for our viewers. We have made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results. We hope we can resolve this for the sake of our mutual users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqMiQ3"&gt;Google today &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-our-youtube-tv-members-roku/"&gt;followed that up with a blog post,&lt;/a&gt; stating that “our initial conversations started with Roku simply to renew the current terms of their ongoing deal with YouTube TV, which has been in place for several years. Our offer to Roku was simple and still stands: renew the YouTube TV deal under the existing reasonable terms.” Google claims that Roku used the opportunity to also “renegotiate a separate deal encompassing the YouTube main app, which does not expire until December.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHFEDT"&gt;One bullet point really does sound like Google wants Roku to get on board with the AV1 codec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NmVWOd"&gt;Our agreements with partners have technical requirements to ensure a high quality experience on YouTube. Roku requested exceptions that would break the YouTube experience and limit our ability to update YouTube in order to fix issues or add new features. For example, by not supporting open-source video codecs, you wouldn’t be able to watch YouTube in 4K HDR or 8K even if you bought a Roku device that supports that resolution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YE6l2r"&gt;The takeaway is that we’re witnessing a more online, digital version of the carriage disputes that are so common between cable providers and content providers. Both companies are choosing their words extremely carefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb73KE"&gt;Roku has insisted it’s not demanding more money from Google, and its email to customers — sent out at 8AM ET this morning — says “we cannot accept Google’s unfair and anticompetitive requirements that would allow for the manipulation of your search results, impact the usage of your data, and ultimately cost you more.” Google’s stance is that it “can’t give Roku special treatment at the expense of users,” and it’s reiterating that there have been no requests to change search or for special access to user data. “This claim is baseless and false,” Google said in its post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZ9c2B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 30th 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated with new information from a blog post published by Google / YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is way behind on algorithmic misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing Examining Voting Rights" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6-nMN9tpoLgAAxOKT_-rWTmT3g=/0x96:7675x5213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194232/1232421321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Evelyn Hockstein-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwVi0T"&gt;One of the scariest concerns about social media is the idea of algorithmic misinformation — that the recommendation systems built into platforms like Facebook and YouTube could be quietly elevating the most harmful and disruptive content on the network. But at a Senate hearing Tuesday titled “Algorithms and Amplification: How Social Media Platforms’ Design Choices Shape our Discourse and Our Minds,’’ lawmakers didn’t appear any closer to finding a solution for the violence platforms like Facebook have &lt;a href="https://t.co/6tvhkqG8hA?amp=1"&gt;internally recognized&lt;/a&gt; they cause in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTx8iL"&gt;At the top, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said “there’s nothing inherently wrong” with how the testifying companies, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, leverage algorithms to keep users engaged on their platforms. He said the committee wasn’t weighing any actual legislation and that the hearing was set to serve as a listening session between the lawmakers and the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aksd9s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7ZkH2"&gt;It’s a major contrast from more focused issues like Facebook’s acquisition practices or Apple’s App Store fees, which have seen immediate action from courts and regulators often set off by congressional fact-findings. But the algorithm issue is thornier and harder to address — and increasingly, there doesn’t seem to be much appetite from lawmakers to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mdpog"&gt;Congress’ slow walk was particularly notable compared with the expert panelists, who presented algorithmic disinformation as an existential threat to our system of government. “The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said Tuesday. “The cost of doing nothing is democracy’s end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdgpWt"&gt;Donovan expressed frustration about the hearing on Twitter afterward, saying lawmakers should have pressed the platforms for more information about the specific mechanisms used to rank content. “The companies should have been answering questions about how they determine what content to distribute and what criteria is used to moderate,” Donovan said. “We could have also gone deeper into the role that political advertising and source hacking plays on our democracy, or the need for curatorial models for information integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvJHc"&gt;Still, the overall impression was that the federal government’s approach to algorithms hasn’t developed much since 2016, and it doesn’t seem likely to move faster anytime soon. “We are still talking about conversations that we’ve had four years ago about spread of misinformation,” said Tristan Harris, co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="179cdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pOoJJp"&gt;Congress first started hearing these arguments on how algorithms amplify extremist content following the 2016 presidential election and the rise of the Trump-wing of the Republican Party. Over the last few years, lawmakers have held hearings. They’ve sent letters. But unlike the testy exchanges and deluge of bills we’ve seen around antitrust and content moderation, they’ve steered clear of regulating algorithms, broadly opting to politely nudge these companies in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTwGLy"&gt;It’s something the lawmaker chairing Tuesday’s hearing, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), acknowledged &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/19/one-on-one-with-biden-ally-and-tech-leader-chris-coons-794105"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last month. Coons said, “Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely, and when it does, whatever it puts in statute often has ended up being stuck or set in place for years.” He continued, “And in an area where technology is moving fairly quickly, sometimes oversight hearings, letters [and] conversations with the leaders of major social media companies can result in those companies demonstrably changing their practices faster than we can legislate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="phSdv2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5SPEv"&gt;This theme was apparent throughout Tuesday’s hearing, and it’s unclear exactly how the committee may move forward on regulating social media algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PswbKI"&gt;The closest Congress has come in recent weeks is a bill introduced in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7MYX8"&gt;In March, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) reintroduced the “&lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-malinowski-and-eshoo-reintroduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-accountable"&gt;Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act&lt;/a&gt;.” The bill would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a way that would remove liability immunity for a platform if its algorithm amplified content related to a civil rights violation. (&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201026/16090345592/another-section-230-reform-bill-dangerous-algorithms-bill-threatens-speech.shtml"&gt;Critics argue it may do more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;.) While the bill has garnered some partisan support in the House following the Capitol riot, the Senate hasn’t taken it up or offered its own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x0G1vr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MMIpiJ"&gt;Most likely, more talking. “I’m encouraged to see that these are topics that are broadly of interest and where I believe there could be a broadly bipartisan solution,” Coons said at Tuesday’s hearing. “But I also am conscious of the fact that we don’t want to needlessly constrain some of the most innovative, fastest growing businesses in the West. Striking that balance is going to require more conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube launches PSAs encouraging Americans to get vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wz3QoGUnS29TIDTEqUUomAkdgBM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188209/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Oz8VJ"&gt;YouTube is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/covid-19-vaccines-get-back-what-you-love/"&gt;launching a series&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccine public service announcements, calling it the “first chapter” of a partnership with the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine’s Vaccine Confidence Project. The ads will start running in the US today and roll out internationally in coming weeks, coinciding with local vaccine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWG9l5"&gt;YouTube posted a dozen 16-second videos &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/vaccineinfo"&gt;on the company’s channel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two 31-second clips (one in English, one in Spanish) and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ziIcbb4xI"&gt;longer compilation&lt;/a&gt; stringing them together. The messages encourage people to “get back to what you love” by getting the vaccine, offering reasons like “because birthday songs,” “because roller coasters,” “because wedding receptions,” and “because everything.” YouTube says they’ll run across its platform — as well as television, radio, and paid social posts — through July, aiming to reach Americans between the ages of 18 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNaNOY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4ziIcbb4xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7QnP"&gt;All US adults are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, and half the adult population has received at least one dose. But vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/coronavirus-cases-rising-vaccine-rates-dropping.html"&gt;slowed markedly&lt;/a&gt; in the past weeks. The slowdown coincided with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399228/covid-vaccine-johnson-pause-lifted-fda-cdc"&gt;a now-lifted pause&lt;/a&gt; on the one-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot, but it may also reflect the need to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-rates.html"&gt;make vaccination easier and more attractive&lt;/a&gt; for people who weren’t in the first rush of dedicated vaccine hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xnNMK"&gt;YouTube says its campaign is aimed at “making sure that people have access to reliable information about the vaccine, including how it was developed and tested, what they can expect when they get the vaccine, and how every person plays a part in the public’s health.” Its blog directs people to earlier vaccine-focused videos with health experts, but the new videos primarily focus on vaccines’ potential to restore “a more normal way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIqFUu"&gt;Social networks, including YouTube, have spent recent years reactively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573019/youtube-information-panels-fact-check-boxes-covid-19-vaccination-misinformation"&gt;addressing anti-vaccination content&lt;/a&gt; on their platforms. As COVID-19 vaccines have begun rolling out in the US, the Biden administration has encouraged the platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22391004/twitter-facebook-snap-white-house-vaccine-campaign"&gt;promote news about the shots&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379710/facebook-us-state-covid-19-vaccine-information"&gt;state-level vaccine information&lt;/a&gt; to its News Feed earlier this month, and Twitter recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1353046517142016001?s=21"&gt;added a prompt&lt;/a&gt; with info from the World Health Organization and other public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube makes it easier to save on data with new video resolution options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HotfZ2qKIRCQeaaRGBrz9LWKI2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176603/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbCxa0"&gt;The YouTube mobile app for iOS and Android now has new video settings that might make it a bit easier to save on data while watching video on the go (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/youtube-adds-even-more-video-resolution-controls-and-options-on-mobile/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Along with specific resolutions in the video player, you can now toggle between three separate modes that either favor video quality, data use, or whatever works best for your current internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBXfCp"&gt;You might already be familiar with “auto” mode as the default setting for most videos, which automatically adjusts video resolution depending on your current internet speed to give the best experience. YouTube’s new additions are the “higher picture quality” mode, which uses more data when not on Wi-Fi and defaults to 720p, and a “data saver” mode that maxes out at 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkG6Bx4FQtnsiKGWLwFjoM1myyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465137/YouTube_resolutionsSettings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new video settings include options for “higher picture quality” and “data saver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CtqSNK"&gt;While these umbrella modes are good for quick scenario-specific adjustments to resolution, you can still dig in and get granular with specific resolutions. And any resolution adjustments can be set for the specific video you’re watching or system-wide for everything you watch, with specific behaviors for Wi-Fi and mobile networks. YouTube &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200309015249/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/91449?hl=en"&gt;has had resolution settings&lt;/a&gt; and ways to keep the app &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/20/how-to-save-data-android/"&gt;from downloading / streaming HD videos&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but this automates the data-saving process and reframes it in a way that’s easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUORpPGbGr2gBBgSsO8L-W2-5L8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465170/youTube_settings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video settings can also be applied system-wide, with separate behavior for mobile and Wi-Fi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIehp0"&gt;In an ideal world, none of this would matter and you could just watch high-resolution cooking videos (my preferred YouTube zone-out material of choice) to your heart’s content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;But even on “unlimited” plans&lt;/a&gt;, most mobile carriers still cap video resolution at 480p. Videos watched at higher resolutions typically count against some kind of premium data allotment or other terrible carrier jargon and hit you where it hurts — in your monthly bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZl961"&gt;YouTube’s new video settings aren’t a magic bullet solution, but they make it easier to switch to a carrier-acceptable resolution without having to think about it. And when all my brain wants is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJx9y9Toto"&gt;ASMR donut videos&lt;/a&gt;, that certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;
