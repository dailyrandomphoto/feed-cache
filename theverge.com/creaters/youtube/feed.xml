        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many can enjoy one year of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&amp;nbsp;for just $1 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCw3hh"&gt;Now that Black Friday is finally upon us, several popular streaming services are offering a number of discounts. New and even some previous subscribers can, for example, enjoy a year of Hulu for just $0.99 a month. While that’s probably one of the best deals out there this year, other services are also great limited-time offers for new, past, and even existing subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best we’ve seen this year to help you get the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEXWCE"&gt;Also, if you’re looking for deals outside of streaming, be sure to also check out our ever-expanding roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find discounts on everything from streaming devices and laptops to TVs and smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ovPPem"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796792/black-friday-tv-deals-2021-sony-lg-vizio-tcl-led-oled-qled-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="5Nikh8"&gt;Get one year of Hulu for $0.99 a month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Frw4"&gt;Both new and returning customers can enjoy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.2655&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;type=4&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month if they subscribe before November 30th. Typically $7 a month — or $70, if you opt for an annual subscription — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. Under this plan, two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. You can also access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices. However, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVaWMP"&gt;Enjoy a free six-month trial of Apple Music and/or a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mBTg0q"&gt;Best Buy is offering new subscribers a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5ciwMOqeh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free six-month trial of Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, giving users ad-free access to 70 million songs. The retailer is also offering new subscribers &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5chUpry59" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. You must create a Best Buy account to take advantage of either deal, however. Best Buy is also offering some small discounts on &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5czYX9Iel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a variety of gift cards&lt;/a&gt;, selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5cyEA0HTD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5cy48cO93" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Vudu ones&lt;/a&gt;, for example, for $42.50 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IGhGjE"&gt;Pay $2 for two months of a YouTube TV add-on channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nnm3c2"&gt;YouTube’s streaming TV service is selling individual add-on channels for &lt;a href="https://t.co/Sexfs3XSv6?amp=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$0.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; for the first two months, assuming you’re a new add-on subscriber. The deal extends to 22 add-ons that typically range between $2 and $10 a month, including Cinemax, Showtime, Starz, AMC Plus, and more (HBO excluded). For the unfamiliar, add-ons are separate from the over 85 channels included in YouTube TV’s base plan. The offer expires on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JVWy1S"&gt;You can also get $50 off your first month of YouTube TV’s base plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="18nbI4"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; interested in YouTube TV’s base plan, new subscribers &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can also try it free and then get $50 off their first month&lt;/a&gt;. The plan typically costs $65, so that means you’ll be paying $15 for more than 85 channels, including NFL, NBA, and MLB networks, PBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon. The plan also comes with unlimited cloud DVR storage space as well as rewind, fast forward, and pause capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="afZPNp"&gt;Amazon’s offering some channels for $0.99 per month for up to two months, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5zz7"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; more than 15 channels for $0.99 a month for up to two months as well. These include Paramount Plus Premium, Starz, Showtime, Discovery Plus, AMC Plus, PBS Masterpiece, Lifetime Movie Club, and more. This deal is only available to Prime members and will be valid through November 29th. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q9QRTD"&gt;New and existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers can get up to six months of Disney Plus for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wWW4MM"&gt;Meanwhile, new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can enjoy six months of Disney Plus for free.&lt;/a&gt; Amazon Music Unlimited starts at $7.99 per month, which is the same price as Disney Plus, so this could save you around $42. Current and former subscribers are both eligible to receive three months of Disney Plus for free under this deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c39mxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="QjGDNb"&gt;AMC Plus is offering a one-year plan for $1.99 per month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxUXd"&gt;If you’re ok with signing up with its annual plan, you can enjoy AMC Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.amcplus.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1.99 a month&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. That means you’ll be paying around $24, which is a 72 percent discount on the service’s typical roughly $84 per year price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koYNx8"&gt;Sign up for Showtime and pay $16 for five months instead of $55&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ8fKF"&gt;New subscribers can enjoy a 30-day free trial of &lt;a href="https://showtime.i7cdw9.net/c/482924/1168420/10655?subId1=VergeStreamingBF112621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.showtime.com%2Fsignup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; before paying $3.99 per month for four months. Normally, Showtime charges $10.99 per month, which means this is a 71 percent discount on a five-month membership, saving you $39. Unlike a lot of the other deals on this list, you have slightly longer to grab it, with the sale ending at 11:59PM PT on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4BoKxS"&gt;Discovery Plus is offering a $3, three-month plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o5cqNJ"&gt;Discovery Plus is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2Fdp%2Fblack-friday-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; new subscribers the first three months of its ad-supported plan for $0.99 cents a month instead of $4.99. That means you’re getting 80 percent off the cost of a three-month subscription, paying $3 instead of $15. The deal ends on November 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dTvvKmRTPHWxC-fJ48tZp2zqKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041975/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_4.19.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;CBS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHTCe5"&gt;You can get one month of Paramount Plus for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="crQDb2"&gt;New subscribers can get one month free of Paramount Plus’ ad-supported Essential plan or ad-free Premium ($9.99/month) plans &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1209284/3065?subId1=VergeBFStreaming112621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Faccount%2Fsignup%2Fplan%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt; until November 29th. After your trial ends, Paramount will charge you $4.99 per month for the Essential plan and $9.99 per month for the Premium. The trial applies to both monthly and annual plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N7OWJQ"&gt;Get three months of Starz for $5 per month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GcYLtZ"&gt;Both former and new subscribers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.starz.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fbuy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can get three months of Starz&lt;/a&gt; for $5 per month instead of $8.99. Note, however, this doesn’t include a free trial. Former subscribers must re-subscribe to redeem this offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku promises to fix issues with HBO, Netflix, and more caused by 10.5 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dFj3liDlncB00d2m13fxzB-bHE=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180825/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WMV7R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;Roku says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working to fix issues that users have been reporting following its 10.5 software update. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/roku-customers-report-streaming-issues-after-10-5-update/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the problems&lt;/a&gt; earlier on Monday, citing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/"&gt;posts on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/"&gt;Roku forums&lt;/a&gt; where users said that apps like HBO Max, ESPN, Disney Plus, and more wouldn’t allow them to watch any video content after updating the OS on their smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY9bcR"&gt;According to Roku, “certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players” are affected by the problematic update. &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;In a post on its forum&lt;/a&gt;, the company instructs users with Roku Ultra models 4660, 4661, 4662, or 4670, and users with a Roku TV model 7XXX to manually check for a software update, and tells owners of other devices to subscribe to the thread for future details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1X0PKK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;System update got you down? We're aware of a small set of users on older Roku TVs or Roku Ultra who are experiencing issues after the OS 10.5 release and are working quickly to resolve. See our realtime updates here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS"&gt;https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roku Support (@RokuSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kG9r8V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Roku has been having users roll back their OS to a previous version on a case-by-case basis, after the user contacts support with information about their devices. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qzyz5g/downgrade_from_105_to_100/"&gt;at least one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; has reported seeing a prompt to “upgrade” from 10.5 to 10.0, Roku doesn’t mention that it’ll be widely offering a downgrade in its posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s65mnG"&gt;While Roku users have also reported issues with streaming using the YouTube TV app, that particular issue doesn’t appear to be limited to just one platform — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-tv-has-been-freezing-up-on-smart-tvs-everywhere/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube TV users have been having issues across almost every device, from streaming boxes like Apple TVs, Amazon Fire sticks, and even Google’s own Chromecasts, to consoles and smart TVs (though it notes that iOS and Android users seem unaffected). YouTube’s support team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462134163872624649"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a fix for the issue on Roku devices, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking into the issue on other devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrpS6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry to hear about the trouble – we've seen similar reports of YouTube TV freezing intermittently, and our team is looking into the issue. Mind sharing what device (model) you're using, and if this is happening to all programs? Appreciate your patience in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AMWhOl"&gt;While it’s certainly odd that the two issues appear to be happening at the same time, they don’t seem to be related given that YouTube TV users are seeing freezes regardless of device. Thankfully, both companies appear to be working on ironing out the problems. Roku is actively updating its support post with instructions to check for updates, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that YouTube TV is getting fewer outage reports on DownDetector.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vozi16"&gt;While the fix for Roku users may solve their problems with Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, their YouTube TV troubles may not be over — Roku and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;are actively feuding&lt;/a&gt; over the YouTube TV not being available on the platform’s store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;Google has threatened&lt;/a&gt; to stop distributing its regular YouTube app on Rokus as well come December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First ever YouTube video edited by co-founder to predict ‘decline’ of the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd7ssraebRp6KAN8yAq-Avc5Ums=/0x20:480x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154351/jawed_karim_at_the_zoo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim edited the description to YouTube’s first ever video (above) to make his opinion known. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkSkPL"&gt;Jawed Karim, the third co-founder of YouTube, has condemned the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773299/youtube-dislike-button-hide-public-count-numbers-small-creator-protection"&gt;removal of public dislike counts&lt;/a&gt; on videos, suggesting that the change will lead to YouTube’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwFVri"&gt;“Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed,” writes Karim. “The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mulkmj"&gt;YouTube made the change to its UI last week, saying it removed public dislikes in order to counter harassment and promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” But many YouTuber users and creators have criticized the decision, arguing that dislike counts give the community a way to express its preferences as well as quickly identify misleading and spam videos promoted by YouTube’s own algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQJyUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqE9cX"&gt;Karim has been getting his own message out in an unusual way: by editing the description to the first video ever uploaded to YouTube, a banal clip titled “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw"&gt;Me at the zoo”&lt;/a&gt; which stars the 25-year-old Karim himself. Karim originally edited the description of the video a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/13/youtube-me-at-the-zoo-dislike-protest/amp/"&gt;few days ago&lt;/a&gt; to read: “When every YouTuber agrees that removing dislikes is a stupid idea, it probably is. Try again, YouTube [face palm emoji].” But this morning he changed this description once again to give a more detailed condemnation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2RxyQ"&gt;“The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform,” writes Karim. “Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. [...] The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vySy4g"&gt;It’s not the first time Karim has used the “Me at the zoo” video as an informal billboard for his opinions on the platform. In 2013, when YouTube announced it would use Google Plus to power comments — a move which many saw as a way for the search giant to force increased engagement for its doomed social network — Karim &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/08/youtube-cofounders-first-public-comment-in-8-years-why-the-f-do-i-need-a-google-account-to-comment-on-a-video/"&gt;changed the video’s description&lt;/a&gt; to read: “why the fuck do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uddM4j"&gt;In his statement today, Karim compares the video in which Matt Koval, YouTube’s “creator liason,” &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kxOuG8jMIgI"&gt;announced the removal of dislikes&lt;/a&gt; to infamous footage of US soldier Jeremiah Denton, who was captured during the Vietnam War. In 1966, Denton was forced to give a television interview by his captors, during which he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/03/29/296211985/j-denton-fo"&gt;blinked in Morse code&lt;/a&gt; to spell out the word “torture.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHB4C"&gt;You can read Karim’s latest update in full below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="description"&gt;The spoken words did not match the eyes. The video reminded me of an interview Admiral Jeremiah Denton gave in 1966. I have never seen a less enthusiastic, more reluctant announcement of something that is supposed to be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4enGm"&gt;Calling the removal of dislikes a good thing for creators cannot be done without conflict by someone holding the title of “YouTube’s Creator Liaison”. We know this because there exists not a single YouTube Creator who thinks removing dislikes is a good idea — for YouTube or for Creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg5Gmb"&gt;Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed. Instead, there will be references to various studies. Studies that apparently contradict the common sense of every YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDLu0l"&gt;The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. The idea was never that all content is good. The idea WAS, however, that among the flood of content, there are great creations waiting to be exposed. And for that to happen, the stuff that’s not great has to fall by the side as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrdchD"&gt;The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre? Because nothing can be great if nothing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3HaD"&gt;In business, there’s only one thing more important than “Make it better”. And that’s “Don’t fuck it up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>YouTube gives dislikes the thumbs-down, hides public counts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JAirWZ9ULkKMC5lbId49dI2yKU=/49x0:913x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122512/Exvh5P5WUAg5Nwy.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to being able to see the like-to-dislike ratio as soon as they click on a video and may use that number to decide whether to continue watching. Now, that will no longer be an option, but it could close off a vector for harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgloWJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenting “I just came here to dislike” may be less satisfying when you don’t see a number go up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQZsH"&gt;YouTube says that when it tested hiding dislike numbers, people were less likely to use the button to attack the creator — commenting “I just came here to dislike” was seemingly less satisfying when you don’t actually get to see the number go up. That behavior may still continue to some extent, though, as creators will be able to see the dislike numbers for their own video in YouTube Studio. The company says this still lets well-meaning viewers leave private feedback to content creators or use dislikes to tune the algorithm’s video recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGq2dz"&gt;Other social networks have given users the option to hide rating metrics, too — Instagram and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454428/facebook-instagram-hide-like-counts-feature-now-available"&gt;famously let you hide like counts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to avoid the potential social pressure that comes with having your main measure of success on the platform shown to everyone. It’s not exactly a perfect comparison — the number of likes your YouTube video gets will still be public (if you leave public ratings on), and Instagram hasn’t turned off likes site-wide yet, but it shows a growing concern with what data creators have access to versus what data their audiences have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="to6BTf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube itself has the most disliked video on YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwRna0"&gt;Dislike counts going private could help hide an embarrassing piece of YouTube history: the most disliked video on the entire site is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;the company’s own Rewind from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. That particular recap video sparked so much ire that YouTube recently announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;the annual Rewind videos were canceled&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an argument that not being able to see public dislikes could lead to users watching a video that’s not very good — an insincere apology, perhaps, or informative-looking content that ends up being an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJzMu8"&gt;Still, YouTube’s argument that it wants to protect smaller creators from dislike mobs or harassment is one that’s hard to argue against. It’s easy to imagine workarounds for some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;the other ideas it floated to combat that behavior&lt;/a&gt;, which included requiring extra info on why you were disliking the video or graying out the dislike button until you’d watched a certain amount of the video. Instead, people leaving dislikes will be doing so for the creator’s eyes only — and screaming into the void just isn’t the same as publicly booing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking policy reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODq4yfj5scuSF17cA4aH0w65c7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70072075/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hoTDKd"&gt;An investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple’s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt; that requires apps to ask permission to track users’ data. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;policy went into effect in April&lt;/a&gt;, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoOi1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;Facebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money “in absolute terms” when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap “fared the worst as a percentage of its business” because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn’t have a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sje4f6"&gt;“Some of the platforms that were most impacted — but especially Facebook — have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,” adtech consultant Eric Seufert told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;. “My belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahNYi"&gt;Apple’s new policy will force social platforms and other apps to get more creative with their advertising. Whether this means focusing on Android devices or investing in Apple’s advertising business — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654121/apple-personalized-ads-ios-15-prompt-app-tracking"&gt;which nearly broke its own rules&lt;/a&gt; by quietly collecting user data in the same way third-party apps did —  they’ll have to figure out another source of revenue that doesn’t involve tracking people on their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKAdRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZxYO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok and Snap want to prove they’re not Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Committee Examines Protecting Kids Online" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsFx3GtQ5ZSGIRYJOBVMPhkvnyw=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049017/1236142202.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFAqJB"&gt;Snap, TikTok, and YouTube set out with one important goal for Tuesday’s Senate hearing on child safety: to convince lawmakers that they are nothing like Facebook. While lawmakers were encouraged by the companies’ transparency, their humble approach hasn’t dissuaded lawmakers from pursuing new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZb8Vv"&gt;While YouTube’s parent company Google has testified before, it was the first time representatives from Snap and TikTok testified before Congress, and they came prepared to differentiate themselves from the social media giant at the center of yet another series of scandals. It was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaks that led senators to pursue these hearings. The Facebook Papers loomed over the event, reinforcing Snap and TikTok’s desire to set themselves apart and promising Congress greater transparency into their internal research and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqQEAM"&gt;“Snapchat was built as an antidote to social media,” Jennifer Stout, Snap’s vice president of global public policy, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0AACA9BA-49C8-4AC3-8C2E-E62ACC3F73BC"&gt;said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to remove Snapchat from the Facebook comparison. “In fact, we describe ourselves as a camera company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0mBw"&gt;“TikTok is a global entertainment platform where people create and watch short-form videos,” said Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of public policy for the Americas. Beckerman continued, noting that direct messages and other social features are turned off by default for young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhKFBk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6U11zl"&gt;Still, the testifying companies’ statements did not quell lawmakers who feared these platforms could be used in the same harmful ways as Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lGbmp"&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Tuesday. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5tH2j"&gt;Before Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers brought in Facebook head of safety Antigone Davis and whistleblower Frances Haugen to discuss how the company’s products, like Instagram, drive young users to content encouraging self-harm and unhealthy behaviors. For years, lawmakers have vowed to produce new legislation to protect children online, but recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting on a cache of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen breathed new life into their willingness to regulate tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8tc3k"&gt;Specifically, lawmakers pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal research&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook noting that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfG0Nd"&gt;At a September hearing, lawmakers noted Davis’ unwillingness to answer questions and her refusal to publish Facebook’s entire body of research on the effects its platforms have on young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2jJXW"&gt;“I don’t understand, Ms. Davis, how you can deny that Instagram isn’t exploiting young users for its own profits?” Blumenthal asked her at the time. “This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkyrYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPEuE"&gt;While Facebook may have refused to publish the research, reporters from a variety of different news publications gained access to additional documents leaked by Haugen and authored a deluge of articles on Monday examining Facebook’s own research and documents on teens and other issues like content moderation lovingly titled the “Facebook Papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4mP7G"&gt;Clearly, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube didn’t want to be on the receiving end of their own “Papers” scandals. During Tuesday’s hearing, all three companies committed to releasing research, data, and independent studies they have conducted to Congress. Lawmakers like Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said that the committee could send these documents to independent experts to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1aUzD"&gt;In a press call with reporters Tuesday, Blumenthal said that his subcommittee would “hold them” to that promise and that lawmakers were “going to pursue legislation,” including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058562/eraser-button-childrens-data-coppa-walberg-rush-hawley-markey-congress-house"&gt;the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPPA) and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;potential markup on the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bill would place new limits on the types of features and content tech companies could provide for children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWuw8t"&gt;Even as Snap, TikTok, and YouTube try to remove themselves from Facebook’s toxic regulatory groundswell, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;tried to pull them closer&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s latest earnings call on Monday. Zuckerberg explained that the company has made changes to its services to support older users, many of whom don’t use platforms like Snap and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MOecf"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. Later, he called TikTok “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” He also announced that the company would refresh Instagram’s app design, making its Reels product “a more central part of the experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels is Facebook’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s growing popularity with young people, allowing users to post videos in a similar style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQt9Jq"&gt;Still, it’s unclear when the companies that testified Tuesday plan to release the internal reporting. Snap, TikTok, and YouTube did not immediately answer requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the timing of these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4r7ys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Vics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Kids’ new monetization policy could defund consumeristic videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1swq_OHwPERLFsYRvkrBhympAs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046925/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P85I9Q"&gt;YouTube is making it harder for kids’ videos that it deems “low quality” to qualify for monetization (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-low-quality-demonetization-kids-video-194733880.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform outlined its updated policies &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/"&gt;in a post on the YouTube Blog&lt;/a&gt;, noting that channels with “made for kids” content will need to abide by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content"&gt;a stricter set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; if they want to stay in the YouTube Partnership Program (YPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqd41d"&gt;Its policies are meant to discourage kids’ content creators from pushing out videos that it describes as “heavily commercial or promotional” or if it encourages “negative behavior or attitudes.” If a channel violates these guidelines, YouTube may suspend them from YPP. Meanwhile, any individual videos that break the rules will lose advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHMgv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality ‘made for kids’ content, it may be suspended from the YouTube Partner Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMtb7N"&gt;YouTube’s new guidelines could impact a number of channels, including one of the biggest kids’ channels on YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w"&gt;Ryan’s World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;Ryan Kaji is a 10-year-old YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; whose videos garner millions of views. At this time of writing, his channel currently has 30.8 million subscribers. Kaji’s massive popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;has landed him a show on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152447/ryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji"&gt;a virtual world on Roblox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5LcWm"&gt;A large number of Kaji’s videos revolve around unboxing toys, as well as showing off toys that Kaji has helped create. It’s definitely what one would describe as “consumeristic” — which is what YouTube says it’s trying to cut down on. YouTube says that it has “reached out to potentially impacted creators” to help them prepare before the policies go into effect in November. If Ryan’s World wants to remain one of the most popular YouTube channels for kids, it may need to make major adjustments to the kind of content it puts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFsuai"&gt;The most recent major change to kid-focused content took place in early 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051465/youtube-coppa-children-content-gaming-toys-monetization-ads"&gt;when YouTube banned targeted advertising, comments, and some community features&lt;/a&gt; for kids’ videos. Just this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298179/youtube-supervised-experiences-content-levels-children-parents"&gt;YouTube rolled out “supervised experiences”&lt;/a&gt; to help parents gain more control of what their older children watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku calls out Google over YouTube contract stalemate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDXz5UnZzmDFuAoumDbn832oXIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025930/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R77EXb"&gt;Tensions between Roku and Google spilled over to customers in a new blog posted by the streaming service on Thursday. After months of failed negotiations for Roku to maintain the YouTube app, the company is accusing Google of anti-competitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIX9YD"&gt;Responding to the deadlocked negotiations, Google said that it would end all distribution of YouTube on new Roku devices after December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJq23"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Roku accused Google of making anti-competitive demands in carriage agreements, like requiring Roku to implement a dedicated YouTube search results row in the Roku interface. Roku also alleged that Google overrides music voice search and blocks relevant searches outside of YouTube’s own results while users are in the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLD5XS"&gt;“Doing business with an enterprise as powerful as Google creates complex challenges,” the blog post said. “Importantly, our concerns with Google are not about money. We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement. In fact, Roku does not earn a single dollar from YouTube’s ad supported video sharing service today, whereas Google makes hundreds of millions of dollars from the YouTube app on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZoqVB"&gt;Outside of these demands being hostile to consumers, Roku also alleged that Google’s requirements give it access to vast amounts of consumer data related to what Roku users watch on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLp2bb"&gt;Roku’s deal to distribute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;the YouTube TV app expired in April&lt;/a&gt; and the company removed the app from its store after failing to reach a new agreement with Google. Roku has consistently accused Google of making unfair demands while not requiring similar data-sharing and search features on other platforms like Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxugc"&gt;“Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYp5b"&gt;The blog comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bipartisan bill to combat anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt; behavior in the tech industry was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would ban similar behaviors alleged by Roku in its Thursday blog, like self-preferencing and discriminating against competitors’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2w4be"&gt;“Roku supports bipartisan efforts such as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to modernize our competition laws, promote innovation, and protect consumers in the Digital Age,” said John Kelly, Roku senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications at Roku in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/support-builds-for-bipartisan-legislation-from-klobuchar-grassley-and-colleagues-to-rein-in-big-tech"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBzllf"&gt;Roku told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday that company representatives were in contact with lawmakers over these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesJzu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/21/19 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGiguxru9rzApZKuJIVKuBLCoGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967245/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
