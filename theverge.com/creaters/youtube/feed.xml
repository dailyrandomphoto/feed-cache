    <title>YouTube TV finally adds Nick Jr. (and the rest of ViacomCBS’s channels)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NSz0OszL3Ithb2s61a4tTEMmFrs=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983498/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWAFoG"&gt;YouTube TV added popular missing channels like MTV and Nickelodeon in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;striking a deal with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt;, but now the streaming service is finally adding in the remaining stragglers like Nick Jr. and MTV2, according to &lt;a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/youtube-tv-adds-the-missing-batch-of-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatToWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSenRm"&gt;The new additions include Nick Jr., Teen Nick, Nicktoons, MTV Classic, MTV2, Dabl, and BET Her. Generally these channels are spinoffs of more well-known offerings like BET and MTV, but Nick Jr.’s younger children’s programming will definitely have some parents breathing a sigh of relief. Dabl — which I had never heard of before today — is apparently ViacomCBS’s “lifestyle-oriented network” for licensing cooking and homemaking shows like &lt;em&gt;Emeril Live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Martha Stewart Living&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably great for a late-night marathon or your daily background noise while working around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfylHk"&gt;Unlike the original addition of ViacomCBS’s biggest channels, this new drop won’t come with a price increase to YouTube TV, but it is the most recent in a collection of small updates the service has received in the last month. In February, YouTube TV announced that it plans to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;a 4K streaming option and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. That same month, it also introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289589/youtube-tv-hbo-max-showtime-starz-bundle-virtual-premium-cable"&gt;a $30 add-on bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 cheaper than they would be separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube can now warn creators about copyright issues before videos are posted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRow8qz9JoKV5i7a_3BbdSA4Q84=/231x0:1287x704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983312/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_3.25.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0udkz"&gt;In an effort to make the process of uploading a video and receiving ad revenue easier, YouTube is rolling out a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/102365314"&gt;new tool called “Checks”&lt;/a&gt; that tells a creator ahead of time if their video contains copyrighted material and complies with advertising guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUdcyS"&gt;Prior to Checks, creators uploaded their videos to YouTube and hoped everything went off &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/10/17268102/youtube-demonetization-pewdiepie-logan-paul-casey-neistat-philip-defranco"&gt;without a hitch&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;uploads for copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;, which could lead to takedowns or copyright holders claiming ad revenue, and whether the video runs afoul of advertising guideline issues. YouTube’s goal is to effectively cut down on the amount of “yellow icons” creators see next to their video, referring to the yellow dollar signs that suggest ad revenue is being held because of copyright or guideline problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxn6tH"&gt;This new system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12165194/youtube-content-id-2-billion-paid"&gt;reliant on Content ID&lt;/a&gt;. If YouTube’s copyright identification system finds a violation after a video is scanned, the rights holder’s policy will be automatically applied to the video, according to the company. This could result in either the video being blocked entirely or the rights holders monetizing the video instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qed1Dm"&gt;If Content ID matches content in the creator’s video to another rights holder, the YouTuber uploading said video will receive notice via Checks to find a way to remove that part of the video ahead of time. This means that videos can start earning revenue the second they’re uploaded instead of going through a claim dispute, which can impact the overall advertising revenue a creator earns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRE4wt"&gt;So what happens if a copyright claim is found, but the creator doesn’t think they’re doing anything wrong? YouTube will allow creators to dispute the claim prior to publishing. Since claims take a few days to process, YouTubers can either choose to wait until the dispute is settled before publishing, or they can publish the video while waiting for the final result. If the dispute finds that the creator did not use copyrighted content, ad revenue earned during that time is paid out to said person. If the dispute finds the rights holder is correct, the ad revenue is paid out to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJDbki"&gt;YouTube is simply making it easier for creators to find — and dispute — claims ahead of time. It’s part of the company’s ongoing efforts to ensure that creators can monetize their videos as quickly and effectively as possible. Other methods, including walking creators through how changes to metadata and tagging can affect revenue post-publishing, are at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg"&gt;a new Creators Insider video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B0A1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRND5H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s70eeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKW9bX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube pulls racist Steven Crowder video for violating COVID misinformation policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J42JBtOqFfpwnBaGOA2_EPQQZfc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981728/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_8.53.36_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlCkM3"&gt;YouTube has pulled a video from conservative commentator Steven Crowder for violating its COVID-19 misinformation policy. A clip from the video where Crowder made racist comments about Black farmers was widely criticized on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJqR1R"&gt;“This video violates our &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785?hl=en"&gt;COVID-19 misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits content claiming that the death rates of COVID-19 are less severe or equally as severe as the common cold or seasonal flu,” YouTube said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, the video was removed from Steven Crowder’s channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJTspZ"&gt;The video was flagged by YouTube’s automated systems when it was uploaded, was immediately blocked from running ads, and was never monetized, YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. YouTube has removed other videos that violate the company’s policies from Crowder’s channel in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTaUyn"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;revoked the ability to run ads&lt;/a&gt; on his channel in August 2019 after former &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; host Carlos Maza evidenced numerous instances of Crowder using derogatory and homophobic comments when talking about Maza. The instance, and conversations about harassment on YouTube that followed, led to YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21005185/youtube-harassment-policy-update-malicious-expression-public-figures-maza-crowder"&gt;introducing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; specifically designed to curb creator-on-creator harassment. After a year demonetizing Crowder’s channel, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;enabled his ability to run ads&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZwzdo"&gt;(Disclosure: &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; is a publication of Vox Media, which also owns &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this: the fight over YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news site — and a cat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iUQYcKGO6KPnBCX2eosNnoMiyPM=/0x9:3918x2621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951186/Screen_Shot_2021_03_11_at_12.38.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SCNR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SqUIW"&gt;YouTube drama remains some of the most interesting drama, and &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on infighting at political YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news company — and the fate of a cat named Betsy — is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uccKyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;’s Will Sommer sets the scene with Pool’s background as a former &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reporter who went independent as an alt-right-adjacent YouTube creator. But the meat of the report is the fight over Subverse, a news media &lt;a href="https://scnr.com/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SCNRtv/featured"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; (renamed SCNR for a hilarious reason you should read the report to learn) for which Pool and his former business partner, Emily Molli, raised over $1 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBaUre"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7URS4gFQFGw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0vV4A"&gt;Molli was joined by another &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;alum, Rocco Castoro, to get the YouTube operation off the ground, and the resulting videos feel a lot like &lt;em&gt;Vice’s &lt;/em&gt;own documentary work. But then problems arose. “Tensions between Pool and his other partners flared...over who had access to various internal systems connected to Subverse,” writes Sommer. Those tensions would lead to Castoro and Molli investigating Pool for “unsavory internet schemes” and leave Betsy, Molli’s cat, allegedly held hostage at Pool’s mansion in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObTlei"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;Sommer’s report on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the complicated journey Betsy took to get back to Molli. But for now, remember: never let your cat go to a second location with a YouTube creator / podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s search bar was spacing out in many web browsers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-xnAZL7eBG_Jd2YnUS4U-bO5jU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944035/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3FtxzF"&gt;So this was a weird one: depending on the browser you’re using, your space bar may not have worked in the YouTube.com search bar for a little while today. Pressing it would make absolutely nothing happen, so your YouTube searches ended up being one long string of words. The bug seemed to be around for an hour, based on when people started sounding off about it on Twitter, but as of 3:50PM ET, the site appeared to be working correctly again on all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWb5EZ"&gt;The bug affected the desktop site, but only browsers that aren’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on Chrome. Firefox wouldn’t take spaces in Windows, macOS, or even Android if you requested the desktop version of the website. Safari on iPhones worked as normal, but the problems showed up on Safari on iPad — probably because iPads request the desktop site, too. Asking for the mobile version immediately fixed it there, and requesting the desktop site on an iPhone immediately broke spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxO3If"&gt;The good news is that the lack of spaces probably didn’t affect your YouTube experience much — it’s very good at understanding your intent even on long, relatively obscure searches with a bunch of words smashed together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc_-A8Cw3uRxM_L_wNGgwH1Hyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_11.12.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s search algorithm was still able to figure it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s00fKw"&gt;There was also another, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more annoying bug: if you were trying to watch a video and type in the search bar at the same time, your keystrokes would end up acting as shortcuts. Pressing the space bar wouldn’t do anything in the search bar, but it would pause your video. Your “T” might show up in the search bar, but it also switched my video into theater mode. This issue is also fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHusqasoK2f1jz8XBtrGrn3z3cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360387/YTBug_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing in the search bar made many awful things happen on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKc0cx"&gt;YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the issue now appears to be fixed. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ma6x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the bug appears to have been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has terminated five Myanmar military-run channels as political unrest continues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protesters hold wet pieces of cloth and plastic bags of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfjrDsxLJaUwwi4xmAiPNRN112A=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919241/1231535547.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aung Kyaw Htet / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="70Efte"&gt;YouTube terminated five Myanmar military channels from its platform on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-youtube/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-tv-channels-from-platform-idUSKBN2AX0BQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The removals include YouTube channels for the government-run Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV) network and the military-owned Myawaddy Media used to spread military propaganda in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kkn82D"&gt;YouTube’s action is the platform’s first major intervention following &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;the military coup that was staged in February&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent military crackdowns against protesters that have left &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/myanmar-military-coup-deaths/2021/03/03/076de674-7c85-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html"&gt;at least 38 dead&lt;/a&gt;. “We have terminated a number of channels and removed several videos from YouTube in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Prior to the coup, the company also terminated 34 channels used as “influence operations” during Myanmar’s election in 2020, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY0XDC"&gt;Facebook has also attempted to limit the military’s influence, banning all military pages on its platforms in February and cutting off the organization’s access to ads on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/technology/facebook-myanmar-ban.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;the military banned Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and has drastically limited access to all social networks by enacting regular internet curfews across the country since the coup began, &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NetBlocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s more active response to the military’s actions could be seen as a direct result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;the criticism the social network received&lt;/a&gt; for its role in the genocidal violence that occurred in Myanmar in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohn6d5"&gt;YouTube’s bans surely haven’t addressed all pro-military propaganda on the platform, but they show a willingness to intervene as protests against the military junta continue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMlpWJ"&gt;Today let’s talk about a comprehensive new report on election integrity, and the particularly low marks it gave to one platform in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6WvZX3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nb0VR"&gt;The 283-page report, which was published today, is called “&lt;a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/report"&gt;The Long Fuse: Misinformation and the 2020 Election&lt;/a&gt;.” It is the final work of a coalition of some of the most respected names in platform analysis in academia and the nonprofit world: the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, Graphika, and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bJoKN"&gt;The report builds on work that the partnership did leading up to and after November to identify and counter false narratives about the 2020 US presidential election. It describes its goals this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2K9LCn"&gt;The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="27onbp"&gt;The hope was that by better understanding how misinformation spreads on social networks, the partnership could push platforms to develop better policy and enforcement tools to reduce the impact of bad actors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ac7qrw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;no widespread fraud&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbcaHv"&gt;Reading through the report, there’s a lot to be impressed by. Foreign interference, which all but defined the 2016 US presidential election, played almost no perceptible role in 2020. After making huge investments in safety and security, platforms really did get better at identifying fake accounts and state-backed influence campaigns, and generally removed them before they could do much about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRQVJi"&gt;The flip side of this, of course, is that 2020 gave US platforms an arguably even more difficult problem to confront: the virulent spread of election-related misinformation from domestic sources, most prominently President Trump, his two adult sons, and a potent ecosystem of right-wing publishers and influencers. Perhaps the report’s most crucial finding, however obvious, is that misinformation in 2020 was an asymmetric phenomenon. The lies were primarily by right-wing actors in the hope of overturning the result of an election that, despite all their viral posts to the contrary, saw no widespread fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3u4ia"&gt;The report makes clear that the platforms did not &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; these lies to be spread. Nor does it seek to make a case that these lies spread primarily through algorithmic amplification. Rather, it places platforms at the center of a dynamic information ecosystem. Sometimes the lies were “top down” — fabricated by Trump and his cronies and then turned into content by partisan media outlets and right-wing influencers. Other times, the lies were “bottom up”: shared by an average citizen as a tweet, a Facebook post, or a YouTube video, which was then spotted by Trumpworld and amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9zd0ub"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube serves as a powerful library for hoaxes and conspiracy content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81oI6i"&gt;These processes worked to reinforce each other, creating powerful new narratives that ultimately fueled the rise of previously obscure outlets like One America News Network and Newsmax. And in all of that, there is plenty for every platform studied here to answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQQK4u"&gt;The report faults platforms for failing to anticipate and “pre-bunk” likely election misinformation; failing to examine the efficacy of their efforts to label misinformation or share those findings with external researchers; and often failing to hold high-profile users accountable for repeated violations of platform policies, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PWBOQ"&gt;Still, in both the report and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkaZI-EiiQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;a 90-minute virtual event&lt;/a&gt; that the partnership held Wednesday, I was struck by the unique — and, to my mind, under-discussed — role that YouTube played in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMoDuF"&gt;So let’s discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l4GWi8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uTcFEy"&gt;The day after the election, I wrote here about &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-youtube-got-played-on-election"&gt;how YouTube was being exploited by the right wing&lt;/a&gt;. Unclear policies, inconsistently applied, combined with opaque or misleading labels had made YouTube a playground for hyper-partisan outlets. Uniquely among platforms, YouTube’s partner program enabled many of these corrosive videos to earn money for their channels — and for YouTube — through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDyMsN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook does not appear on the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zWH1dP"&gt;The EIP report picks up on all these themes and more, fleshing them out with new data and explaining the special role YouTube played in cross-platform misinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JimiqV"&gt;Here are three key observations from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4syyI"&gt;One, &lt;strong&gt;for misinformation narratives tracked by the project using Twitter’s API, YouTube was linked to more than any other platform&lt;/strong&gt;. For tweets containing links to misinformation, YouTube ranked third among all domains, behind Gateway Pundit and Breitbart. Researchers tracked 21 separate incidents, generating nearly 270,000 retweets, that pointed to YouTube. The next-highest ranking platform, at 17th, was Periscope; Facebook does not appear on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI4ZJ7"&gt;This finding speaks to the way YouTube serves as a powerful library for hoaxes and conspiracy content, which can continuously be resurfaced on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms via what the report calls “repeat spreaders” like Trump and his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRIYxq"&gt;“It was kind of a place for misinformation to hide and be remobilized later,” said Kate Starbird, an associate professor and co-founder of UW’s Center for an Informed Public, in a response to my question during Wednesday’s event. “From our view, it was a core piece of the repeat spreading phenomenon, and a huge piece of the cross-platform disinformation spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpyD4G"&gt;YouTube disputes this conclusion and says its rank on this chart is more of a reflection of the site’s popularity in general than a comment on the accuracy of the information found there. Other sites, including &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, ranked high on the list because they contained information debunking false claims rather than advancing them. “In fact, the most-viewed election-related content channels are from news channels like NBC and CBS,” YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPr1z2"&gt;Two, &lt;strong&gt;YouTube’s library of misinformation was enabled by policies that tended to be more permissive than similar ones from Facebook and Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;. An analysis of platform policies leading up to the election found that in August 2020, YouTube failed to adopt comprehensive policies related to misinformation about how to vote, incitements to voter fraud, or efforts to delegitimize election results. By the end of October, the only significant change YouTube made was to adopt a comprehensive policy about voting procedures, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAbgxo"&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok all implemented comprehensive policies designed to thwart efforts to delegitimize the election. (In fairness to YouTube, the report’s policy analysis still ranked it above NextDoor and Snapchat, which were found not to have adopted comprehensive policies in any of these areas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="piknU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;every platform struggled to moderate live video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PpRvLo"&gt;“YouTube lagged in terms of their implementation,” said Carly Miller, a research analyst at Stanford. “Things were able to propagate on the platform because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j18LfT"&gt;YouTube disagrees with this conclusion as well and sent me a long list of policy changes it had made over the past year, including some that were copied by its peers. “As we’ve publicly discussed, we don’t agree with EIP’s framing of our policies or our efforts,” Shadloo told me. “Our community guidelines are generally on par with other companies and we launched several products in 2018 and 2019 to raise authoritative content and reduce borderline videos on our site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmVIx2"&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;the report found that every platform struggled to moderate live video in particular&lt;/strong&gt;. Some videos containing lies about the election attracted millions of views before they received so much as a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2MJD5"&gt;“All platforms struggle with labeling,” said Nicole Buckley, a research analyst at UW. “But in particular YouTube had issues with adapting to embedding labels in new forms … of content sharing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aUmlC"&gt;Ultimately, the EIP reached very different conclusions about YouTube’s performance in the 2020 election than YouTube itself did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTyD7w"&gt;“This is a cross-platform, cross-media set of issues where each part of the ecosystem is leveraged in a different way,” Shadloo said, echoing a conclusion drawn by the EIP researchers. “No two platforms face the exact same challenges, and … interventions that make sense for one may not for another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DseqDp"&gt;On that point, YouTube and the EIP agree. But for the most part, I have the same concerns about the platform that I had in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="izA8TQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="bKxX7Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made options are the 2017 Apple TV 4K or what Apple now calls the Apple TV HD, the older model from 2015. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago. Even the Apple TV HD still costs $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPkleZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously stated that Apple’s only remaining TV hardware was the Apple TV 4K. It has been updated to reflect that Apple still sells the older Apple TV HD. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rudy Giuliani just lost his YouTube privileges for two weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rudy Giuliani Appears Before Michigan State Legislature’s House Oversight Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGYR4_NR5NhQLyjqIs2XzSAoOwc=/0x81:5077x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895097/1229918044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wikrPL"&gt;YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It’s Giulani’s second strike within 90 days, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/youtube-suspends-rudy-giuliani-again-for-election-fraud-claims"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani’s promotion of nicotine, which is against the company’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvUyKd"&gt;“We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We removed content from the Rudy W. Giuliani channel for violating our sale of regulated goods policy, which prohibits content facilitating the use of nicotine, and our presidential election integrity policy. Additionally, in accordance with our long standing strikes system, we issued a strike against the Rudy W. Giuliani channel, which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KHFBo"&gt;In January, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/youtube-temporarily-suspends-rudy-giuliani-from-partner-program?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;suspended Giuliani for a week&lt;/a&gt; for sharing 2020 election misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; him from YouTube’s partner program, meaning he couldn’t earn ad revenue on his videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7AT5Y"&gt;If Giuliani gets a third strike in the same 90-day period following the first, his channel will be permanently removed from YouTube, according to the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;company’s strikes policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmZZIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook continue bans over Trump election claims","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s ‘supervised experiences’ help parents choose what content their kids can see</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJa41hIVcbnlTRHHbR5oRdm5YjE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867114/Supervised_Experiences.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5nPYd3"&gt;YouTube is announcing “supervised experiences,” a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the streaming video platform. According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube hopes the filters will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app. The program will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psHndH"&gt;Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account. There’s the “Explore” level, which YouTube says is “generally suitable” for kids nine and up’ “Explore More,” which is meant for kids 13 and up; and “Most of YouTube,” which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content. In the US, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409#zippy="&gt;and most other countries&lt;/a&gt;, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0p8OAQ5nQ_TrCUvkoYNedOn8XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324445/Supervised_Experiences_Content_settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parents choose a content level for their children’s account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUbXH"&gt;It isn’t clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube says the “Explore” level will have “vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more.” As the name suggests, the “Explore More” level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned “Explore” categories. The company says that “Most of YouTube” will contain “sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9lClh"&gt;For all its promise, YouTube’s supervised experiences is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it won’t be perfect, admitting that it “will make mistakes,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;we’ve seen happen with the Kids app&lt;/a&gt;. As such, parents shouldn’t think of it as a “set it and forget it” solution. They’ll still need to remain vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmQEq9"&gt;Nevertheless, the new content options should help parents with children who feel too confined by the Kids app (which YouTube still recommends for younger kids) but are too impressionable to be exposed to the full YouTube experience. YouTube can be a dangerous place full of misinformation and conspiracy, so it’s good to see Google giving parents tools to help ease their children into it.&lt;/p&gt;
