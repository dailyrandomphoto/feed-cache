    <title>YouTube TV is $10 off for your first three months </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New YouTube TV subscribers can pay YouTube TV $54.99 each month instead of $64.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0ADTn"&gt;Just in time for Super Bowl season, a three-month subscription to the YouTube TV streaming service is a little more affordable. Right now, new subscribers can &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;pay $54.99 each month instead of $64.99 for your first three months&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that would cost you around $195, so that means you’ll pay $165 by the end of this discount period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx08Ii"&gt;That’s still expensive, but it’s a welcome discount for a service that significantly gone up in price within the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109018/youtube-tv-price-change-signup-grandfathered-google"&gt;last few years&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, it’s a solid streaming app if you want many channels on-demand (with DVR capabilities available), presented in a familiar YouTube interface. For this price, you’ll get access to over 85 major channels, covering live sports, news, entertainment, and more. It also includes unlimited recording for up to six accounts, and you can cancel whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNS9ey"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="zz8Pdv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846634/youtube-tv-disney-streaming-channels-dispute-espn-fx"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22878110/super-bowl-lvi-2022-no-4k-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RDiInC"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on3ady"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max over-ear headphones sold for their lowest price ever during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In case you missed out on that deal, you have another chance at saving big today. For the first time since the holidays, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy the headphones in the sky blue colorway for $449 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 shy of their best price ever. That equates to a savings of $100 on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQQ7R"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s over-ear headphones offer excellent sound quality, while boasting great spatial audio features so you can better immerse yourself in a movie or  compatible music. The headphones are comfortable to wear for a long time as well thanks to their breathable knit mesh canopy. While $449 is still quite expensive, this could be a good deal for those deeply embedded within the Apple ecosystem given how seamlessly these headphones can also pair with other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XA9McH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvE4iK"&gt;When we first published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra one year ago, we called it the best Android phone on the market. We were impressed with the huge phone’s excellent camera system, as well as its stunning 6.8-inch dynamic OLED screen that boasts a high refresh rate. We appreciated its lengthy battery life, too, as well as how fast the  Snapdragon 888 processor-powered phone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Raudj"&gt;Though, almost a full year out from its release, we wouldn’t suggest paying $1,199.99 — its original price. However, if you can be swayed by a decent deal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the phantom black, 128GB model for $1049.99 today&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $150. That’s the lowest we’ve seen it sell for since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67VNhH"&gt;Note, Samsung will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Galaxy S22 series&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when, but that means we’ll likely see even more discounts on the Galaxy S21 lineup sooner rather than later. Still, if you can’t wait, this is a good deal for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoP20p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvmHwQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893756/samsung-galaxy-s22-2022-preorders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ab5Gu2"&gt;On the market for a budget-friendly tablet? Amazon is selling its 2020 Fire HD 8 tablets for half-off, with the ad-supported, 32GB base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $44.99 instead of $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you want slightly more RAM and wireless charging, the Fire HD 8 Plus is also 50 percent off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $54.99 instead of $109.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I7pLX"&gt;Regardless of which you buy, both offer a USB-C port for faster charging, and have a faster processor than their predecessors. While app selection is limited to Amazon’s Appstore, that still gives you access to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Zoom, Outlook, and more. If you’re leaning toward the Fire HD 8 Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in his review that you can use the Plus as an Echo Show if you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MP4PNYG/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase Amazon’s wireless charging dock alongside the tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so costs $108, down from $163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fLyTb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="t6bbI0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BXkoFx"&gt;Here are some even more deals to treat yourself to this weekend:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rUrVrp"&gt;Typically $59.99, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F265419191923%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkHzZbW8KkgQEADiqzkcqzSQgmhXsDBMhRufhkwVazKmaFBPeBDG82c%252FRmtwDbnCzhMqvq7yXrDR2PPTZy%252F9vFsysnuyNx5wGB%252FL4xiibIrnlaELM03nhesgW0oaZcTAlOogZvdMHW9b8n6EuttuaZIADxG3YYMFG5WBFm9zHztRfwoxxh3ksNJLLamCrfpuhiw%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMnv6xpNBf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s official eBay storefront is selling wired Xbox One gaming headsets for just $19.99.&lt;/a&gt;  While it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;the latest version&lt;/a&gt;, it should be suitable if you don’t want to spend too much on a headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BNVlyp"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which is compatible with 11-inch iPad Pros (2018 and up) and the fourth-gen iPad Air, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals1212022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-1st-2nd-or-3rd-Generation-and-iPad-Air-4th-Generation-iPad-Not-Included%2F984505060&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for $229 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $70 discount on the keyboard, which you can use to transform your tablet into something that’s more like a laptop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1UA0vo"&gt;The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is once again selling for $19.98 instead of $29.98&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the holidays, which is just $2 shy of its Black Friday price. This model supports &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Key-In-Garage-Delivery/"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, giving drivers the ability to securely drop packages off in your garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CZ6OXg"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pc150-2-pack-20w-usb-c-pd-wall-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy this two-pack of 20W USB-C chargers for $12.99 from Ravpower&lt;/a&gt; when you use the promo code &lt;strong&gt;RT50&lt;/strong&gt; (usually $27.99).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xiqt3Q"&gt;LaCie’s Rugged Mini 4TB external hard drive is on sale, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B01789QMUW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $129.99 instead of $159.&lt;/a&gt; If you need less storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B0058VIWTM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB model is $69.99 instead of $84.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>You can now save $20-$36 a year on YouTube Premium and Music Premium with new annual plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dCRnid3ewQH8Gfagfp2XVQICGlU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410593/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8BTJH"&gt;If you’re a new or existing user of YouTube Premium and Music Premium, which let you watch and listen ad-free, you might be able to save up to $36 a year with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/11417260?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;oco=0"&gt;Google’s new annual plans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/18/youtube-premium-music-annual/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. From now until Sunday, January 23rd, users can receive an extra discount with the promo rate, but the new annual plans cost less than the current monthly rate either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlEdJC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium’s new annual plan&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $107.99, roughly $36 less than you’d pay for a year at its current monthly price of $143.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf2PuU"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium Music&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, the annual rate is currently $89.99, but will be priced at $119.88 after Sunday — still nearly a $30 savings over paying monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UrrVNQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"After years of false starts, YouTube is now serious about music streaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17391686/youtube-music-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JVhxao"&gt;Users are still able to sign-up for a month-to-month subscription, too — $11.99 for YouTube Premium and $9.99 for YouTube Music Premium, the same price as they were before. Both services offer a 7-day free trial period for new users before the user is charged for the full month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzCaAR"&gt;Though the annual subscription offers a one and done option for YouTube Music Premium users, it might not make sense if you’re grandfathered into an earlier, cheaper plan. You’d be paying 11 cents more for an annual plan if you’re currently paying $9.99 a month for YouTube Music, and it’s an even worse deal if you still have the old $7.99 plan, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdO524"&gt;With an annual plan, you have to pay for either service upfront, and YouTube says it won’t automatically renew at the end of one year. For existing subscribers, you may need to change your plan to qualify: It’s not available for those on family and student plans, and existing individual users on monthly subscriptions have to cancel their current plan before they can purchase the annual service. The plans are also only available in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Thailand, India and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyGfbb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will stop making most original shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMj6GYhMIMN3oP8RTpPjNJAfNj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405082/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8sHbJe"&gt;YouTube will scale back a significant portion of YouTube Originals, which produced original content including scripted series, educational videos, and music and celebrity programming. Chief business officer for YouTube Robert Kyncl announced the changes today in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rkyncl/status/1483502275804872704"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sc50hg"&gt;Going forward, the company will only fund originals in the YouTube Kids Fund and the Black Voices Fund, a program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288066/youtube-black-creator-amplify-fund-initiative-ceo"&gt;created in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that committed $100 million to “amplify” Black creators on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZEM8e"&gt;“With rapid growth comes new opportunities and now our investments can make a greater impact on even more creators when applied towards other initiatives, like our Creator Shorts Fund, Black Voices Fund, and Live Shopping programming to name a few,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD7Xdb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over six years, YouTube made few titles that looked like breakout hits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EKtGYt"&gt;YouTube Originals has changed approaches throughout the years. Created in 2016 and led by Susanne Daniels, it began with scripted shows and movies focused on creators, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10905654/youtube-red-originals-premiere-date-scare-pewdiepie"&gt;comedy-thriller series &lt;em&gt;Scare PewDiePie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/22/15855570/youtube-red-originals-250-million-views"&gt;YouTube said&lt;/a&gt; the subscriber-only first season of originals racked up 250 million views. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18116154/youtube-premium-free-ads-subscription-red"&gt;pivoting&lt;/a&gt; toward ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15552204/youtube-original-tv-shows-kevin-hart-ellen-degeneres"&gt;content featuring celebrities&lt;/a&gt; like Katy Perry and Kevin Hart, free for users to access without a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL2Ecm"&gt;But over six years, YouTube made few titles that looked like breakout hits. And by the end, it was unclear what the original programming provided strategically to a service that’s already one of the most popular video destinations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyiSgW"&gt;Today’s statement also announced Daniels will depart the company in March, which also contributed to the decision to scale back the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR8TK9"&gt;New original programs were being announced as recently as last year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419244/youtube-will-smith-alicia-keys-new-originals"&gt;series featuring&lt;/a&gt; Will Smith and Alicia Keys. YouTube says it will honor existing commitments for shows in progress and will contact creators in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3z2W38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDReOk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="j7pUq4"&gt;P.S. Julie, if you’re reading this, tell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jatomic/status/1481022484874997761"&gt;your 10-year-old&lt;/a&gt; we said hey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="WVxIPI"&gt;
&lt;p id="dCcyjp"&gt;Hot Pod Summit is almost here! We’re hosting the invite-only event on February 24th in Brooklyn, New York, as part of On Air Fest. You can see this year’s On Air Fest lineup and &lt;a href="http://onairfest.com/"&gt;buy tickets here&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have more to share on programming and ticketing for Hot Pod Summit in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TMKEgv"&gt;
&lt;p id="LzIjHx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: $100K podcast fund launches for upstart shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrLbBE"&gt;Starting today, budding US-based podcasters can apply to receive money from &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;a new podcast sponsorship fund&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used for any purpose, from paying contributors to buying recording equipment. The fund, called &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;Podca$h&lt;/a&gt;, will deliver one-time payments between $250 and $5,000 to up to 100 recipients. Eligible applicants include people who’ve never podcasted before, as well as those who’ve received less than $10,000 in total funding or sponsorships for an existing project. Applications are open until March 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODv0cF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAl7bZ"&gt;Podca$h was conceived to help more creators make well-known, well-paying podcasts. The two companies funding and operating the program, the short-form audio platform &lt;a href="https://racket.com/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; and money-management software &lt;a href="https://www.usestir.com/"&gt;Stir&lt;/a&gt;, share a mission of supporting homegrown projects and helping them take off. “In podcasting, the rich tend to get richer,” says Racket founder and CEO Austin Petersmith. “We wanted to limit this campaign to people who have yet to make significant revenue for their podcasts. We also didn’t want to exclude those who have been at this for a while and are making, say, a few hundred dollars a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kia3pR"&gt;Recipients will be chosen by a panel of judges with fingers on the pulse of digital media — angel investor and &lt;a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/"&gt;podcast host&lt;/a&gt; Jason Calacanis, the YouTube-using artist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/humblethepoet/?hl=en"&gt;Humble the Poet&lt;/a&gt;, and several executives overseeing audience growth and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJz5cg"&gt;Podca$h is a sponsorship program, not a scholarship. Recipients will be asked to deliver an ad read for Racket and Stir on the shows they ultimately develop, “but whether they do it or not will be on the honor system,” says Petersmith. Full terms can be found on &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;the official Podca$h website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKKE40"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An industry so big it needs librarians to organize it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSTYva"&gt;Podchaser, the &lt;a href="http://podchaser.com/"&gt;podcast discovery service&lt;/a&gt;, recently hired Norman Chella as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NormanChella/status/1477802853515202562"&gt;full-time “podcast librarian&lt;/a&gt;.” Chella is only the second person I’ve ever heard of to have that job title — and shortly after his role was announced, Ma’ayan Plaut, who’s considered to be &lt;a href="https://radiopublic.com/weird-work-859DbP/s1!1a925"&gt;the first podcast librarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maayanplaut/status/1478015150829576196"&gt;welcomed him to the club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kJxGU"&gt;A librarian for podcasts does a lot of the things that a librarian for books would do — add new titles to a collection, organize them so people can find what they’re looking for — which, as the audio landscape gets more crowded, offers a systematic way to find shows. This helps overwhelmed listeners, and it also helps podcasters, for whom making money requires a show to be discoverable, both by audiences and potential advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s53L4"&gt;As Plaut told me over email, there have been people in the audio industry with “the heart and spirit of a Podcast Librarian” since podcasts emerged. But Plaut and Chella may very well be the only ones who’ve ever been given designated, full-time librarian titles for audio companies. And while there’s a fair amount of similarities between Plaut’s 2016–2019 tenure at RadioPublic and Chella’s new role at Podchaser, the ways that the role has changed in just a few years show how much the podcast industry has changed, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="fzDay4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m here to provoke every single person in the podcast industry to record their body of work accurately.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zaM3WN"&gt;The biggest shift is the increased emphasis on ad sales. While Plaut spent a lot of her time finding, listening to, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/radio-public/happy-international-podcast-day-from-the-radiopublic-reference-desk-2dad8e5904b9"&gt;recommending shows&lt;/a&gt; for curious listeners, Chella knows that companies are increasingly curious, too, and he tells me he’ll be working to ensure that both the stats that are pulled in from streaming platforms (e.g., estimated monthly listens) and the specs that users add themselves (e.g., host bios) are correct. As Chella says, “a misstep in crediting can prevent that one sponsor from reaching out to your podcast for a great deal. You never know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HALnDx"&gt;Another change is the addition of a “curator” role to Chella’s plate, since there’s plenty of room for error in both the automatic and manual ways of contributing data that I mentioned above. Podchaser’s library may have predated Chella, but it takes a human to monitor such a system, coach people on how to contribute to it, and identify ways it could be better. As Chella says, “I’m here to provoke every single person in the podcast industry to record their body of work accurately.” This includes things like getting folks to credit shows’ contributors using uniform language, an area where Podchaser is &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaTSzMkBnxpZOoMcvPBN_FczgxIvm-ik/view"&gt;trying to establish standard terms&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes getting podcasters excited about being documented at all — in Chella’s words, “getting their name etched in podcast history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkOKi4"&gt;No one took over Plaut’s librarian position when she left RadioPublic three years ago. But times are a’changing, and there’s a lot to do, so it seems likely that we’ll see more of these jobs pop up soon. As Chella puts it, surprisingly calmly, “the mission to document the timeline of every podcast in the world requires someone’s full attention on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmgLrb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube temporarily bars Dan Bongino for COVID misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz7Tcp"&gt;Conservative talk show host Dan Bongino has had his YouTube account and monetization privileges temporarily suspended after receiving his first “strike” for violating the company’s COVID misinformation policy, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/589853-youtube-temporarily-suspends-demonetizes-dan-bonginos-channel"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bongino is a big name in radio — he’s Cumulus Media’s Rush Limbaugh replacement — so YouTube is showing here that moderation rules apply even to a major host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99CgKz"&gt;This stands in contrast to Spotify’s resistance to moderating or removing content from the comparably controversial Joe Rogan. Rogan has also been sharing dangerous information around COVID, enough that &lt;a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/"&gt;hundreds of medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; recently petitioned Spotify to enforce a misinformation policy. But Spotify has not responded to calls to take his episodes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mBqfiO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IFrvOc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC funding nearly slashed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx6Wct"&gt;It’s a storyline that will &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/02/donald-trump-public-media-pbs-npr-1202856498/"&gt;sound familiar to US residents&lt;/a&gt;: over the weekend, the publicly funded BBC was threatened with the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/bbc-licence-fee-to-be-abolished-in-2027-and-funding-frozen"&gt;elimination of most of its financial support&lt;/a&gt;. This was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/business/bbc-license-fee.html"&gt;ultimately walked back&lt;/a&gt; and replaced with a less catastrophic change, but it’s one that still deals a blow to the broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3gyGD"&gt;On Sunday, the UK culture secretary threatened to end the license fee that residents pay to the BBC, which makes up three-fourths of its funding, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/business/bbc-license-fee.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fee was expected to remain frozen for the next two years, rather than rising proportionately with inflation, then be phased out entirely by 2027. By Monday, the only remaining change was the freeze. Though the longer-term fate of funding is unclear, even the fee freeze will affect BBC’s ability to create programming, necessitating what &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/bbc-licence-fee-to-be-abolished-in-2027-and-funding-frozen"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be “hundreds of millions of pounds” in budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXVNaU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recordings for Spaces for all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTecYp"&gt;Twitter is now letting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22882479/twitter-spaces-recordings-ios-android"&gt;all Spaces hosts record their sessions&lt;/a&gt; on mobile, then access detailed attendance numbers. Users will now be able to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1482048722167123979"&gt;differentiate between listeners&lt;/a&gt; who tuned in live versus those who watched the replay for up to 30 days after a Space ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rU9OmX"&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uy60K"&gt;Excited to see you Insiders on Thursday! And Friday! Aria lives on!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baby Shark is the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8E_0SBxYFEVw5RhBo9NqfQmq6s=/12x0:1389x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383939/Baby_Shark_Dance____babyshark_Most_Viewed_Video___Animal_Songs___PINKFONG_Songs_for_Children_0_18_screenshot__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinkfong&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kxYgKE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"&gt;“Baby Shark”&lt;/a&gt; became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546350/baby-shark-youtube-video-most-popular-despacito-masha"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and just over a year later, it has achieved another huge milestone: it has become the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ik1Wh2"&gt;“Baby Shark” is a cultural touchstone at this point. I remember singing it at summer camps as a kid growing up, and given the record-breaking popularity of the music video (which was created by the entertainment company Pinkfong), it seems I’m not the only person who will never forget this song. (I’ve been idly tapping my foot to the beat in my head the entire time I’ve been writing this post.) But the song’s impact doesn’t stop with the earworm hit. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10518284/"&gt;a Baby Shark show on Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/baby-shark-movie-1235063576/"&gt;a Baby Shark movie&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, as you may have feared, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pinkfong-unveils-baby-sharks-first-ever-nft-collection-on-makersplace-301433995.html"&gt;Baby Shark NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aMFUd"&gt;If you’re curious what the other top-viewed YouTube videos are, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos"&gt;Wikipedia looks to have a comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt;. The second most-viewed as of this writing is Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” which held the crown before “Baby Shark” did, though, with 7.7 billion views, it has a long way to go to try and catch the shark. (And I hope that by mentioning another extremely catchy song, I got “Baby Shark” out of your head for the day.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OP7lPoF9NjIHj15Xk3XaYcX_0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297871/1230436485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mh8joz"&gt;There’s something extraordinarily frustrating about subscribing to a TV service only for that service to lose the programming you signed up for. But that threat of lost channels — or worse, the actual loss of major networks — is a recurring problem for internet TV services, and it comes up &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cFpe8"&gt;The latest incident hit just this weekend: late Friday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX, disappeared from YouTube TV when the two companies failed to reach a deal to keep them on the streaming service. The dispute didn’t last long. Just 36-or-so hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845373/youtube-tv-disney-espn-channel-fx-abc-restored"&gt;the companies came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; — soon enough to avoid anyone missing ESPN’s Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y250tf"&gt;It was an outcome Disney could pretty much bank on. “Great content always wins and has great leverage,” Keith Zubchevich, CEO of streaming data company Conviva, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Audiences want the best content, regardless of where they pay for it or watch it. It’s up to aggregators and big platforms to make sure they get the deal done, especially in streaming where consumer choice is even greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0iMSo"&gt;Seeing two companies publicly duke it out over contract negotiations like this has become commonplace. In July, Fubo TV lost &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/tv/2021/07/ae-history-lifetime-channels-dropped-by-fubotv-in-what-company-deems-a-cost-cutting-measure.html"&gt;several channels&lt;/a&gt; from A+E Networks, including History Channel, Lifetime, and A&amp;amp;E. Hulu with Live TV has lost &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/sinclair-rsn"&gt;support for some Fox regional sports channels&lt;/a&gt; last year, while Sling TV lost &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;NBC regional sports networks&lt;/a&gt; in April. YouTube TV has publicly sparred with Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; in the past four months alone, reaching last-minute deals that allowed users to continue using their services or platforms as they had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rjMPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They essentially want the consumer to get mad.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqWqGf"&gt;Each time, these negotiations broke out into public view, letting subscribers know their service’s channel selection may be on the line. So why play up the drama and send subscribers into a tizzy — or worse, have to issue rapid-fire news updates about dropped and subsequently restored service — when more often than not, a resolution is the most likely outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyWeAn"&gt;“They’re all playing to the same audience, which is the consumer. They essentially want the consumer to get mad,” Zubchevich says. “It’s all about a narrative in the public perspective that is essentially trying to maintain: how are viewers going to hold value in different brands?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kj4pU"&gt;In streaming, content is only as valuable as its ability to hang on to customers. So while Disney and YouTube TV were unable to reach a deal initially last week, YouTube TV clearly foresaw the impact the loss of those channels could have on its business. Disney is the parent of ESPN, and YouTube TV was positioned to lose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;five ESPN properties&lt;/a&gt; should the two parties have failed to reach an agreement. With Monday Night Football in full swing, the impact on YouTube TV’s business would have almost certainly been brutal. So it’s no shock that YouTube TV worked diligently to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o84I1Q"&gt;“Sports has always been a genre of entertainment, much like movies, that drives engagement, drives subscribership, that drives viewership,” Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with Parks Associates, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The collective sports content community understands the value of what they’re offering. They can drive engagement and subscribership arguably like no other genre in any video. So they know that their content is of value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ryHGIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrzTn"&gt;These disputes are part of the growing pains that come with making content deals in such a new space. Zubchevich says networks don’t want to make long-lasting deals because it’s hard to estimate what their content will be worth even a couple years out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA1mvc"&gt;“Carriage deals are so short because viewing is growing so rapidly, it’s nearly impossible to quantify a multi-year deal or predict what viewing will look like on a longer timeframe,” Zubchevich says. “And it’s so last minute because they’re trying to determine whether content or eyeballs are king — waiting to see who will blink first as it plays out in public view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SP8BY"&gt;Plus, new ad formats and distribution options make streaming-era negotiations for content even more complex, Anjali Midha, co-founder and CEO of analytics company Diesel Labs, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ3Kt2"&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential,” Midha says. “There’s also the need to maintain much more flexibility given the industry is still transforming around us. As a result, it’s not a big surprise that the negotiations are much more complex and taking longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS1oLI"&gt;Youtube TV and Disney may be resolved, but the tight turnaround may just suggest the strategy works — wait till the last second, alert consumers, and fight for a better deal — and we’ll see more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and YouTube TV cut a deal to bring back ESPN, FX, and other channels</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1kaPt"&gt;Disney and YouTube TV have reached a deal today to put more than a dozen Disney-owned channels back on Google’s internet TV streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDgJod"&gt;The news follows a previous announcement late Friday that the two had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;failed to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; before their contract expired, and users were informed they would no longer have access to the channels, which included ESPN, Disney, FX, and other Disney-owned properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYw0eS"&gt;“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks,” Disney said in a statement. “We appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, and we’re thrilled that our robust lineup of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming is in the process of being restored to YouTube TV subscribers across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmTw1a"&gt;With the loss of channels, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 to $49.99 per month. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the reinstated service, YouTube TV said it would return to its original $64.99-per-month service cost, but that it will “honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1vDaH"&gt;“For active members who have not yet received that $15 discount on their monthly bill, you will automatically receive a one-time credit on your next bill with no action needed,” YouTube TV said. “For members who were impacted and have initiated the cancellation process, we would love to welcome you back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng2o9T"&gt;YouTube TV said that it has started to restore access to the Disney-owned properties on its service, including local ABC stations, which will return “over the course of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV loses ESPN, other Disney networks after failing to reach new deal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIpNoJ"&gt;YouTube TV has failed to reach an eleventh-hour deal with Disney to keep more than a dozen Disney-owned channels on the live TV streaming service. As of December 18th, popular networks including ESPN and ABC have been removed from the service. As promised, YouTube TV has dropped its subscription to $50 per month as a direct result of the lost programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmJt1"&gt;Disney said in a statement late Friday that after ongoing negotiations with YouTube TV, “they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59idpb"&gt;“As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks including live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from ABC, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels,” the company added. “We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yybvk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV said it would “continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL1MYp"&gt;“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months,” YouTube TV said. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEBkGZ"&gt;The announcement follows a notice shared with subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833849/youtube-tv-disney-carrier-dispute-abc-news-espn-december-17"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the channels could vanish from YouTube TV on Friday, December 17th if a deal was not reached between the two companies. Should negotiations have failed, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 a month from its normal price of $65 per month to compensate for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68xPDf"&gt;Earlier this week, a positive resolution to the service loss seemed likely. For one, the service told subscribers in an email on Monday that the House of Mouse “is an important partner for us,” adding that it hoped to negotiate a deal with Disney “provided we can reach equitable terms.” But the companies failed to reach a deal as their current agreement lapsed after December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjBqy"&gt;The loss of over a dozen channels doesn’t exactly help YouTube TV remain competitive against other internet cable services like Hulu with Live TV or Fubo TV. Not only are a dozen-plus channels getting wiped from service, but the list of Disney-owned properties that would be axed is extensive, including not only Disney channels but FX, ESPN, and National Geographic channels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt6lX8"&gt;The full list of channels that left because a deal was not reached include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSVKDl"&gt;Your local ABC channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gFaE4O"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72HTNZ"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ewvx48"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pZSi1J"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iqBij3"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8KgIcc"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U7e16Q"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5zOJgq"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlAuvW"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWgOJw"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eHN7rI"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38eRKt"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgi7xm"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I7dODa"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwESS1"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1o3Azw"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKLTHR"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw6GWW"&gt;Carriage disputes are frustratingly common in our new streaming landscape, and they often play out publicly before a resolution is reached — as was the case recently with YouTube TV and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;NBCUniversal-owned channels&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequently, two parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;fail to reach a deal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the consumer who winds up paying the price by having to shop around for a new provider if they want support for their favorite programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minecraft crosses 1 trillion views on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="minecraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsF-_9U-r2mSe7jPdkGL2X-H13w=/0x21:1100x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278139/Minecraft-360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnQdWk"&gt;Long before the metaverse became the premier destination of tech companies and newlyweds, there was &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. It is a platform that started as a video game about dodging explosions from hissing cactus-shaped creatures and became the blank canvas on which millions of players create their content, upload it, and generate trillions of views — literally. Today, YouTube, in collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;developer Mojang, is celebrating an unprecedented trillionth view (trillion with a &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;) with a snapshot of the game’s unique and transformative history on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNhjYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller Lydia Winters attributes the game’s trillion views to her team’s respect for the myriad ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5KlwK"&gt;“We have people who are off on an adventure and people who are building and people who are playing together, and all those ways of playing are important to us,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller, her team’s job is to create and curate a world players want to create in. That enabling of all kinds of storytelling has been critical to the game’s nigh untouchable popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCRd9U"&gt;“The reason why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been so successful on YouTube is because YouTube videos are a way to tell stories,” she says. “So then when you have &lt;em&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/em&gt; and you can tell any story you want in a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; world, it’s a big reason why we have so many people creating&lt;em&gt; Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9WtFl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All those ways of playing are important to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmujtn"&gt;By the numbers, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube community has over 35,000 creators from over 150 countries. The kind of content on YouTube ranges from simple role-playing “Let’s Plays” to videos that don’t feature actual gameplay from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayyVUl"&gt;Earnest Pettie, culture and trends insights lead at YouTube, is responsible for keeping track of all the weird and wild ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on the site. He’s fascinated by one creator in particular who uses the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic and is popular within the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community without actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN9V0c"&gt;“Interestingly, one of the biggest trends on &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;is actually animation, and that’s animation either created with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; or animation that is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic,” Petite says. “There’s this creator named Jake Fellman, who creates YouTube shorts. He’s created about 100 &lt;em&gt;Minecraft-inspired&lt;/em&gt; shorts that are actually computer animation. He’s one of the most viewed &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; creators of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0Ntz8"&gt;Fellman’s videos are 15-second bursts of hyper-realistic, “What if &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; graphics were rendered with the Unreal Engine 5” shorts that feature cute interactions with monsters or sheep and garner over 1 million views a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftpx9k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6O5LgOZl-I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9aS4U"&gt;YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/minecraft-trillion/"&gt;a fascinating breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of the history of the game on its platform over the last 11 years, complete with stats and graphs and facts about what it took to make 1 trillion views. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtrgJt_lnjr3XqaMDwksa-4FU1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099334/minecraftgraph.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="44uRvU"&gt;It’s interesting to see how genres of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos change over time as they fade in and out of popularity. In &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s early years, the multi-million view hits were &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I-sH53vXP2A"&gt;music video parodies&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; household names like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ"&gt;CaptainSparklez&lt;/a&gt;. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt; (who recently won a Game Award for content creator of the year) dominates the charts with his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RJ0jdO5ZfU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; manhunt series&lt;/a&gt; that features his friends trying to stop Dream from completing the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJOsXy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game on YouTube ever. In 2020, it earned over 200 billion views; second place — which was curiously Roblox, another sandbox-style game — earned less than half that. Part of that seemingly untouchable popularity is because of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s nature. It’s an open space ripe for all kinds of creation and iteration on that creation in a way no other video game can boast. The other reason, according to Pettie, is the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkcIfU"&gt;“One trillion views doesn’t happen without the creative ingenuity of all the creators who have uploaded &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos over the years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rejuOz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1bu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV warns subscribers it could lose Disney’s channels later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOVVwiqNzAvhFhq51X2-sXYFOic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268622/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyMCeF"&gt;Google has warned that YouTube TV could lose access to over a dozen Disney-owned channels later this week if it’s unable to renew its agreement with the company. In a &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV says its current deal with Disney is due to expire this Friday, December 17th, after which the channels could disappear if it’s unable to reach a new agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXJErM"&gt;“Our ask of Disney, as with all of our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider – by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them,” YouTube’s blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA6lGF"&gt;Here’s the list of impacted channels. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-channels-pulled-youtube-tv-1235061987/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that eight ABC local stations could also disappear from YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THHcx7"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n7zA2I"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pOgMmH"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UONIYH"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cFXKPu"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfvV2X"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33a4HL"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPwucW"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FRDRm2"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XS2dPN"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wBVBxJ"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E64O4W"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="afjA3W"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWZSf0"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GQmtnz"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlXfrR"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5jlW6"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jbI7jn"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Disney said that it’s “committed to working with Google to reach a fair, market-based agreement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYbHEv"&gt;“We are optimistic that we can reach a deal and continue to provide their YouTube TV customers with our live sporting events and news coverage plus kids, family and general entertainment programming,” Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2aXU8O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always want to be transparent and give you a heads-up during these active conversations. Disney is an important partner, and we’re optimistic that we can work with Disney and keep their content available on YouTube TV. For live updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5"&gt;https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube TV (@YouTubeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1470533371046416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBOTnY"&gt;If a deal can’t be reached by December 17th, YouTube TV says it will decrease its prices by $15 per month while Disney’s channels are off its service. It says that customers are free to pause or cancel their memberships at any time, and points them towards Disney’s $13.99 per month streaming bundle if they want to maintain access to “some” of Disney’s content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5mMJ1"&gt;This is just the latest high profile carriage dispute YouTube TV has been involved in this year. These have affected both the company’s deals to offer streaming content from other companies, as well as its agreements with hardware providers to host YouTube’s apps. Less than three months ago the service was just days away from losing access to NBCUniversal’s channels before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;reaching an agreement in early October&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this month it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;reached an agreement with Roku&lt;/a&gt; for it to continue carrying YouTube’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;
