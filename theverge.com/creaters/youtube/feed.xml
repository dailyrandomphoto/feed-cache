    <title>Comcast now sells Xfinity Flex users internet cable TV from YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrwiM_klb8ozay2ZHEgUg-pZzBU=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251941/Web_Publishing_XfinityFlex_YouTubeTVLaunch_16x9_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NRDjUc"&gt;Comcast is introducing YouTube TV to its Xfinity Flex devices, providing users another avenue for opting out of traditional cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MgqhS"&gt;YouTube was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previously supported&lt;/a&gt; on Comcast’s Flex boxes, but the addition of YouTube TV gives users the ability to get some 85-plus live television channels for $65 per month. It’s not the first live TV streaming service to arrive on the platform — Sling and Hulu with Live TV were already supported. But it does diversify the streaming options for people who don’t want to pay Comcast for cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpmBa5"&gt;Colin Petrie-Norris, senior vice president of consumer entertainment at Xfinity, said &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of YouTube TV “is another example of how we surround our broadband service with value, giving our customers access to all their preferred content and subscriptions on one device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWItlR"&gt;It’s a curious move from a cable provider, but it also makes sense if Comcast wants to stay competitive against other over-the-top boxes like Roku, Fire TV Stick, or Chromecast — all of which support YouTube TV. Currently, Comcast provides the boxes to its Xfinity Internet customers at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no additional cost&lt;/a&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need people to use them. And that means supporting popular apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k57vG9"&gt;YouTube TV is available to Flex users beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8PPE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new year-end live event, Escape2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooGePdsoPo3VwWxLUToyJLwfQBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250714/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQqmJa"&gt;YouTube will host a 24-hour interactive live event featuring musicians and creators to look back on the platform’s biggest trends and videos of 2021, the company announced today. The event, called Escape2021, will have three chapters, the first of which begins on December 16th at midnight ET. The goal of Escape2021: liberate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJRHqCRvD0c"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; from the confines of her bedroom and studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oSqOA"&gt;Escape2021 comes after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube Rewind, the high-production recap videos the company published at the end of each year that had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;derided by creators&lt;/a&gt; for sanitizing the platform to appeal to advertisers. YouTube said in October it would “refocus our energies” to create different kinds of productions instead. Escape2021 isn’t meant to replace Rewind but offer a new way to celebrate the year’s biggest trends, Lauren Verrusio, a YouTube spokesperson, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyDbmD"&gt;The event seems to be an attempt by YouTube to offer more immersive online experiences, like when fans watched &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-army-butter-melting-video-9564987/"&gt;butter melt&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a new BTS song. YouTube says there will be trivia questions, trend-based challenges, and “real-time live experiences,” all leading up to musical performances. One example of a challenge, echoing the BTS livestream, will require viewers to identify what butter sculptures the band has melted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASw5Bl"&gt;YouTube says the event will include performances and appearances from BTS, Doja Cat, and Mark Rober, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nMNN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 9th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a comment from a YouTube spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku settles YouTube dispute and locks down apps in ‘multi-year’ deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44iguyJWJvPtvclOTEijl986rw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244236/DSCF3621_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnZz6h"&gt;Roku has reached a deal with Google to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on its platform. The two had been at odds over a contract extension, sparring over what Roku described as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;onerous demands&lt;/a&gt; by Google for more data and more prominent placement on its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfIeay"&gt;If they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22820988/roku-google-youtube-december-9-deadline"&gt;hadn’t reached an agreement by tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Google planned to pull the YouTube app from Roku — a loss for basically everyone involved, but especially Roku users who would have no longer been able to download a key video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmEijN"&gt;“This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” Dallas Lawrence, a Roku spokesperson, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google confirmed the deal to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said both apps will be available through the Roku store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7cjso"&gt;Roku described the deal as a “multi-year extension” for YouTube and YouTube TV. YouTube TV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled by Roku from its channel store&lt;/a&gt; in April as tensions between the two parties escalated. After months of stalled negotiations, Google said in late October that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;it would pull the YouTube app on December 9th&lt;/a&gt; if a deal hadn’t been reached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku could lose YouTube this week — so now’s a good time to download the app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxyQ__NtaB6e8Idm8KRCQL50E1U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240836/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6YxOkB"&gt;An escalating feud that has pitted YouTube, one of the most popular streaming apps in the world, against Roku, a leader in TV streaming devices, could be about to boil over. Both companies have said that unless they can reach a new distribution agreement in the coming days, the YouTube app will be removed from Roku’s channel store for new users on December 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5LoWy"&gt;The major development would follow months of stalled negotiations, and there have already been consequences for consumers caught in the middle: the YouTube TV app was pulled from Roku’s channel store earlier this year, though it can still be accessed by customers who already downloaded it. Now the much more popular &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/d5d327036e51ffcf1a4780dd78a85a3b/youtube"&gt;YouTube app&lt;/a&gt;, a portal to the world’s largest video sharing platform, faces the same cutoff and store removal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIshxa"&gt;With the deadline for a new YouTube deal looming, Google and Roku have continued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;publicly bickering and expressing frustration&lt;/a&gt; with each other over the last several months. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv?Ref=CJ&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cj_affiliate_sale&amp;amp;utm_content=5040886&amp;amp;utm_term=11553901&amp;amp;cjevent=4c23ff1d56d111ec81e1d2f30a82b832" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku has accused Google of anticompetitive behavior&lt;/a&gt; and says the company’s terms and requests go beyond the asks of other major streaming services, while Google has maintained Roku’s claims are baseless and criticized the company for trying to negotiate new deals for YouTube TV and YouTube simultaneously instead of handling them separately. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;added a YouTube TV backdoor&lt;/a&gt; directly to the regular YouTube app to preserve live TV access for subscribers of the $65-per-month service; Roku responded by calling this the behavior of an “unchecked monopolist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmWmLF"&gt;Losing YouTube would be a significant blow for Roku’s platform, though it’s one that others have faced. Amazon’s Fire TV devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;went without an official YouTube app&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year before the two sides came to a deal in that case and the app returned. Apple has managed to keep YouTube on its Apple TV set-top boxes from the start, though its own differences with Google have sometimes delayed features like 4K playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4Ztly"&gt;Still, one of the core appeals of Roku is its simplicity and vast app selection. Having a hole the size of YouTube in its app catalog would throw a wrench into that reputation. This type of situation always comes down to the wire — just as it recently did when YouTube TV and NBCUniversal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;managed to settle tense carriage talks&lt;/a&gt; without any channels being lost. So stay tuned, and it’d be a good idea to &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/d5d327036e51ffcf1a4780dd78a85a3b/youtube"&gt;download YouTube to your Roku devices&lt;/a&gt; now just in case things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwgFiD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 8th, 9:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Roku and Google have reached a new multi-year deal to keep YouTube on the platform and bring back YouTube TV. You can &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;&lt;em&gt;read more about the resolution here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reveals millions of incorrect copyright claims in six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI4S5QatWSGpqfsLHMtN_DeS5CA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235302/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N4UQ5z"&gt;Over 2.2 million copyright claims hit YouTube videos before later being overturned between January and June of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the company today. The Copyright Transparency Report is the first of its kind published by YouTube, which says it will update biannually going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoWMD5"&gt;The 2.2 million incorrect claims represent less than 1 percent of the more than 729 million total copyright claims issued in the first half of this year, 99 percent of which originated from Content ID, YouTube’s automated enforcement tool. When users disputed these claims, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBHU5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5AssGC"&gt;Though mistaken copyright claims are a drop in the bucket on a larger scale, YouTube creators have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;long complained&lt;/a&gt; about how the platform handles claims, saying overly aggressive or unjustified enforcement can lead to lost income. Copyright claims can result in videos being blocked, audio being muted, or ad revenue going back to the rights owner. This new report gives shape to a problem that YouTube itself has acknowledged needs updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy1eAt"&gt;In 2019, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post that the company heard the concerns from creators and that YouTube was “exploring improvements in striking the right balance between copyright owners and creators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6hp6"&gt;The new report notes that “no system is perfect” and that errors happen even with established guardrails in place to prevent abuse of enforcement mechanisms. “When disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse, and over 60% of these disputes were resolved in favor of the uploader,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAFwwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story stated 2.2 million videos were hit with copyright claims that were later overturned. In fact, 2.2 million claims were issued that were later overturned. YouTube did not provide the number of videos that were subject to overturned claims. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig’s livestream was interrupted by a copyright warning days after joining YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDebIKeFdsOfEX217bwtUVrhZEw=/208x0:2620x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228280/ludwig_youtube_suspended_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ludwig via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=API5Lt8t7Ho" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3oQbdo"&gt;Just three days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808873/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon-youtube-gaming"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren left his massive Twitch following for YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he was hit with what he thought was a suspension from the platform. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/former-twitch-subathon-star-ludwig-suspended-days-after-1848156400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ahgren was playing other YouTube videos during his stream, when he landed on the infamously catchy &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; song. His stream was shut down shortly thereafter, giving his viewers — and himself — the impression that he was banned for violating YouTube’s copyright policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LSzvcl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;you could say the switch has been going well... &lt;a href="https://t.co/dnkjSUkT0o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dnkjSUkT0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1466576027858001928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzAuO"&gt;However, Ahgren wasn’t actually struck with a copyright strike or a suspension. “Ludwig wasn’t suspended,” Lauren Verrusio, the head of creator and consumer communications at YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our Content ID tool picked up his playing of an unlicensed video while he was going live to fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSufM1"&gt;The whole incident was just a case of confusion. “If Ludwig were to have just stopped playing the copyrighted material, he could have continued the livestream just fine,” Verrusio explained. “But he wasn’t sure of what he was seeing on the backend and thought it was a suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx7RrR"&gt;Ludwig addressed the incident in a video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0"&gt;his secondary channel&lt;/a&gt;, in which he interprets the warning as a ban. “I’m pretty sure the corporate overlords who own &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down.” Verrusio notes that YouTube is in touch with Ahgren to explain the platform’s copyright rules, and that Ludwig plans on going live again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0k1Y"&gt;DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has caused issues across all video sharing and livestreaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;with creators getting videos unknowingly taken down and demonetized&lt;/a&gt; for having copyrighted material. Earlier this year, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;rolled out a tool&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to delete old videos that contain copyrighted music, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-wave-warning-notice"&gt;issued a wave of copyright strikes&lt;/a&gt; in response to DMCA complaints. Like Twitch, YouTube also operates with a three-strike policy — accrue three copyright violations and you’re permanently banned. To help soften DMCA’s blow, YouTube started telling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335728/youtube-checks-monetization-copyright-claim-dispute-tool"&gt;creators if their content contains copyrighted material&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their videos are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJkTE5"&gt;As Ludwig gets acquainted with his new streaming hub, his mistakes likely won’t go unnoticed. He currently has 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube, with more bound to trickle in from what’s left of his fanbase on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned you can surf YouTube on old Chromecasts with a hidden phone remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_z5iz2MVB7F30OanoCvntH1FHKk=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70225907/PXL_20211203_200442272.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O8oknN"&gt;Did you know the YouTube app on your older Chromecast has a hidden remote control that lets you surface an entire YouTube app that you can scroll?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I824Fk"&gt;You just need to start casting something to your TV in the YouTube app with the Cast button up top — then hit the Cast button a second time to access a menu where you’ll find a button labeled Remote. Then, you get a full D-pad to move around, a voice search button, and the all-important Back button you’ll need to back out of that video and access a full YouTube interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJiZDP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Watching YouTube on your TV with Google Chromecast? You can use your phone as a remote to cast and control the YouTube app on your TV. Here's how: &lt;a href="https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3"&gt;https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nAaYUKx0Sy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nAaYUKx0Sy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzSm8F"&gt;Originally, the Google Chromecast HDMI dongle required you to control it largely from your phone, “casting” each and every video you wanted to watch to your TV screen instead of browsing — until the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;2020 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; added its own physical remote.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6Obq5"&gt;But apparently, that changed. &lt;a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/youtube-chromecast-remote-hidden-ui-google-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; reported in February&lt;/a&gt; that the YouTube app on Chromecast had added a browsing experience with the hidden remote, and sites &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/03/youtube-app-chromecast-ultra/"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-brings-the-full-youtube-app-experience-to-your-older-chromecast/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that it’s broadly rolling out to older dongles like the third-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra. That’s a nice bonus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"&gt;if you recently nabbed the Ultra for $22.22&lt;/a&gt; in the Stadia sale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOXk9a2pITMYhEwCY8KjeqSPIJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061469/PXL_20211203_200908381.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0j1mdo"&gt;I can’t confirm when it rolled out, but I do see that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;Google’s support page has officially added instructions for using the remote&lt;/a&gt;, something that the Wayback Machine tells me wasn’t yet there back on, say, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211005012925/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, and the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760"&gt;tweeted about the feature&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH8Va3"&gt;The phone remote is a little laggy compared to using a dedicated remote or even using an iPhone to control an Apple TV, but it works fine so far on my Chromecast Ultra. I’d probably use it a lot if I valued YouTube’s recommendations more. (I don’t understand why it keeps recommending videos I’ve already watched and ones from many years ago.) I wish it were available in Netflix, where I do tend to scroll a lot, but I didn’t see the option there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU4e5X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig, the streamer who broke the all-time Twitch subs record this year, is moving to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzNFp2Yczx7EwQ9wT-oZj_12Q1k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207451/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_4.51.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ludwig posted a video announcing the move Monday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ludwig (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIliHG_yo7w" target="_blank"&gt;via YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfnDDg"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren, a streamer perhaps best known for his month-long subathon that took place earlier this year, is moving from Twitch to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1465442046328524805"&gt;stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Ahgren’s first stream on YouTube will take place tomorrow, November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dugxj"&gt;Ludwig leaves behind a significant presence on Twitch. He has &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig"&gt;3.1 million followers&lt;/a&gt;, and TwitchTracker’s metrics indicate he has more than &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/ludwig/subscribers"&gt;27,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. And by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22362532/ludwig-twitch-subathon-ends-stream-ninja-subs-record"&gt;end of his subathon&lt;/a&gt;, he had broken the all-time Twitch subs record — TwitchTracker says &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time"&gt;he peaked at 283,066 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. But he won’t be starting from nothing on YouTube, where he already has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA"&gt;2.08 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id="lEvye4"&gt;Ahgren is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube as of late, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652368/timthetatman-streaming-twitch-switch-youtube-gaming"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar’s&lt;/a&gt; jumps in August and September, respectively. YouTube also brought over Jack “CouRage” Dunlop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (who announced on November 23rd that he would &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CouRageJD/status/1463190958909054987"&gt;remain on the platform&lt;/a&gt;), and Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Cyber Monday streaming deals for Hulu, YouTube TV, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i_qBEMrD_E-nGxdLB9nlq4BpO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70195034/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many can enjoy one year of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service for just $1 per month.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCw3hh"&gt;Black Friday was longer than usual this year, with deals beginning weeks in advance, though Cyber Monday is the perfect end-cap to it. Several popular streaming services are offering a number of discounts for Cyber Monday. New and even some previous subscribers can, for example, enjoy a year of Hulu for just $0.99 a month. While that’s probably one of the best deals out there this year, other services are also great limited-time offers for new, past, and even existing subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best we’ve seen this year to help you get the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEXWCE"&gt;Also, if you’re looking for deals outside of streaming, be sure to also check out our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals happening now&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find discounts on everything from streaming devices and laptops to TVs and smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ovPPem"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"},{"title":"The Verge Cyber Monday 2021 live blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22807793/cyber-monday-2021-live-blog-lightning-deals-tech"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="5Nikh8"&gt;Get one year of Hulu for $0.99 a month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Frw4"&gt;Both new and returning customers can enjoy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.2655&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;type=4&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month if they subscribe before November 30th. Typically $7 a month — or $70, if you opt for an annual subscription — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. Under this plan, two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. You can also access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices. However, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DWyeal"&gt;New subscribers can get three months of TIDAL for $1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tjPTtO"&gt;New subscribers can get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Foffers%2Fblackfriday&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Tidal HiFi for just $1&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, you’ll essentially pay around $0.33 per month instead of $9.99 for unlimited access to more than 80 million songs and 350,000 music videos. Alternatively, you can&lt;small&gt; &lt;/small&gt;get three months of Tidal HiFi Plus — which typically costs $19.99 a month, and comes with perks like Dolby Atmos support&lt;small&gt; —&lt;/small&gt; for $2. The deal is valid through December 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVaWMP"&gt;Enjoy a free six-month trial of Apple Music and/or a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mBTg0q"&gt;Best Buy is offering new subscribers a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5ciwMOqeh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free six-month trial of Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, giving users ad-free access to 70 million songs. The retailer is also offering new subscribers &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf5chUpry59" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a free three-month trial of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. You must create a Best Buy account to take advantage of either deal, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IGhGjE"&gt;Pay $2 for two months of a YouTube TV add-on channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nnm3c2"&gt;YouTube’s streaming TV service is selling individual add-on channels for &lt;a href="https://t.co/Sexfs3XSv6?amp=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$0.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; for the first two months, assuming you’re a new add-on subscriber. The deal extends to 22 add-ons that typically range between $2 and $10 a month, including Cinemax, Showtime, Starz, AMC Plus, and more (HBO excluded). For the unfamiliar, add-ons are separate from the over 85 channels included in YouTube TV’s base plan. The offer expires on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JVWy1S"&gt;You can get $50 off your first month of YouTube TV’s base plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="18nbI4"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; interested in YouTube TV’s base plan, new subscribers &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can also try it free and then get $50 off their first month&lt;/a&gt;. The plan typically costs $65, so that means you’ll be paying $15 for more than 85 channels, including NFL, NBA, and MLB networks, PBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon. The plan also comes with unlimited cloud DVR storage space as well as rewind, fast forward, and pause capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="afZPNp"&gt;Amazon’s offering some channels for $0.99 per month for up to two months, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5zz7"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; more than 15 channels for $0.99 a month for up to two months as well. These include Paramount Plus Premium, Starz, Showtime, Discovery Plus, AMC Plus, PBS Masterpiece, Lifetime Movie Club, and more. This deal is only available to Prime members and will be valid through November 29th. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q9QRTD"&gt;New and existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers can get up to six months of Disney Plus for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wWW4MM"&gt;Meanwhile, new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can enjoy six months of Disney Plus for free.&lt;/a&gt; Amazon Music Unlimited starts at $7.99 per month, which is the same price as Disney Plus, so this could save you around $42. Current and former subscribers are both eligible to receive three months of Disney Plus for free under this deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c39mxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday weekend deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="QjGDNb"&gt;AMC Plus is offering a one-year plan for $1.99 per month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxUXd"&gt;If you’re ok with signing up with its annual plan, you can enjoy AMC Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.amcplus.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1.99 a month&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. That means you’ll be paying around $24, which is a 72 percent discount on the service’s typical roughly $84 per year price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koYNx8"&gt;Sign up for Showtime and pay $16 for five months instead of $55&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ8fKF"&gt;New subscribers can enjoy a 30-day free trial of &lt;a href="https://showtime.i7cdw9.net/c/482924/1168420/10655?subId1=VergeStreamingBF112621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.showtime.com%2Fsignup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; before paying $3.99 per month for four months. Normally, Showtime charges $10.99 per month, which means this is a 71 percent discount on a five-month membership, saving you $39. Unlike a lot of the other deals on this list, you have slightly longer to grab it, with the sale ending at 11:59PM PT on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hczf82"&gt;Get one month of Philo for $5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YMyWFx"&gt;Philo normally costs $25 per month, but right now you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philo.com/login/subscribe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get the first month of your membership for $5 instead&lt;/a&gt;. Those who have never opted in to use a free trial are also eligible for this deal. You can get the discount by entering the code &lt;strong&gt;BFCM &lt;/strong&gt;when signing up. This offer will last through the end of December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4BoKxS"&gt;Discovery Plus is offering a $3, three-month plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o5cqNJ"&gt;Discovery Plus is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2Fdp%2Fblack-friday-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22800858%2Fblack-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; new subscribers the first three months of its ad-supported plan for $0.99 cents a month instead of $4.99. That means you’re getting 80 percent off the cost of a three-month subscription, paying $3 instead of $15. The deal ends on November 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Roku promises to fix issues with HBO, Netflix, and more caused by 10.5 update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dFj3liDlncB00d2m13fxzB-bHE=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180825/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WMV7R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;Roku says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working to fix issues that users have been reporting following its 10.5 software update. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/roku-customers-report-streaming-issues-after-10-5-update/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the problems&lt;/a&gt; earlier on Monday, citing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/"&gt;posts on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/"&gt;Roku forums&lt;/a&gt; where users said that apps like HBO Max, ESPN, Disney Plus, and more wouldn’t allow them to watch any video content after updating the OS on their smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY9bcR"&gt;According to Roku, “certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players” are affected by the problematic update. &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;In a post on its forum&lt;/a&gt;, the company instructs users with Roku Ultra models 4660, 4661, 4662, or 4670, and users with a Roku TV model 7XXX to manually check for a software update, and tells owners of other devices to subscribe to the thread for future details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1X0PKK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;System update got you down? We're aware of a small set of users on older Roku TVs or Roku Ultra who are experiencing issues after the OS 10.5 release and are working quickly to resolve. See our realtime updates here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS"&gt;https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roku Support (@RokuSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kG9r8V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Roku has been having users roll back their OS to a previous version on a case-by-case basis, after the user contacts support with information about their devices. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qzyz5g/downgrade_from_105_to_100/"&gt;at least one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; has reported seeing a prompt to “upgrade” from 10.5 to 10.0, Roku doesn’t mention that it’ll be widely offering a downgrade in its posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s65mnG"&gt;While Roku users have also reported issues with streaming using the YouTube TV app, that particular issue doesn’t appear to be limited to just one platform — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-tv-has-been-freezing-up-on-smart-tvs-everywhere/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube TV users have been having issues across almost every device, from streaming boxes like Apple TVs, Amazon Fire sticks, and even Google’s own Chromecasts, to consoles and smart TVs (though it notes that iOS and Android users seem unaffected). YouTube’s support team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462134163872624649"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a fix for the issue on Roku devices, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking into the issue on other devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrpS6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry to hear about the trouble – we've seen similar reports of YouTube TV freezing intermittently, and our team is looking into the issue. Mind sharing what device (model) you're using, and if this is happening to all programs? Appreciate your patience in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AMWhOl"&gt;While it’s certainly odd that the two issues appear to be happening at the same time, they don’t seem to be related given that YouTube TV users are seeing freezes regardless of device. Thankfully, both companies appear to be working on ironing out the problems. Roku is actively updating its support post with instructions to check for updates, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that YouTube TV is getting fewer outage reports on DownDetector.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vozi16"&gt;While the fix for Roku users may solve their problems with Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, their YouTube TV troubles may not be over — Roku and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;are actively feuding&lt;/a&gt; over the YouTube TV not being available on the platform’s store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;Google has threatened&lt;/a&gt; to stop distributing its regular YouTube app on Rokus as well come December.&lt;/p&gt;
