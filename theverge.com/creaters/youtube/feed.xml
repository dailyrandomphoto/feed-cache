    <title>Demi Adejuyigbe reminds us that, once again, it’s September 21st </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhAGjL"&gt;The 21st of September? Buddy, that’s today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dNXMu"&gt;Lest you forget, comedian Demi Adejuyigbe has returned to memorialize Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire Day — more specifically September 21st, subject of the band’s evocative summer anthem “September.” For years, Adejuyigbe has jumped on the opportunity to mark the occasion with elaborate, often outrageous videos that have included everything from aerial banners to a mariachi band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nauq0I"&gt;The videos have become such a reliable marker of the end of summer that Adejuyigbe was able to hit a goal of $50,000 for charity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449277/september-21st-date-demi-adejuyigbe-earth-wind-fire"&gt;in just three hours&lt;/a&gt; last year, with the campaign ultimately generating more than $330,000 over the period of several days (more than $50,000 per charity listed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBlv5V"&gt;Adejuyigbe’s video for 2021 hit the interwebs not too long after 9:21AM PT. This year, he’s raising money for Imagine Water Works, a disaster relief organization helping with Hurricane Ida relief; the West Fund, a nonprofit for abortion access in Texas; as well as climate advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement. Adejuyigbe is raffling off a painting — September 21st-themed, as expected — that he promises to hand-deliver to the winner, regardless of where they live. Donations of $10 count toward a single raffle ticket. For each $100,000 reached, Adejuyigbe will also raffle off a September 21st jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nteekw"&gt;Adejuyigbe said this year’s video will be his last, but added that he hopes “we can use this last video to do some good.” Raffle tickets can be purchased &lt;a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21stthats-today-by-demi-adejuyigbe"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. As of 9:45AM PT, the fundraiser had already generated more than $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the YouTubers determined to find lost media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sCwC-RHX-F1GCne1KUh-_Mv9zQ=/119x0:1382x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866569/a2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bobdunga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AM5RO"&gt;When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ib-AJA7v9Kk"&gt;remember Slamball?&lt;/a&gt;) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It’s been stuck in my head for years. I guess you’re expecting me to link the commercial I’m describing, right? Well, I can’t, because I’ve never found it. I’ve never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what’s known as “lost media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM1W5Y"&gt;Online, there’s a lost media community dedicated to preserving everything from unaired television pilots to unreleased video game prototypes. Currently, the lost media community exists on both YouTube and &lt;a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home"&gt;the Lost Media wiki&lt;/a&gt;, an archive of thousands of lost media topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LSuperSonicQ"&gt;LSuperSonicQ&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known member of the lost media community and has many videos covering lost media topics such as the &lt;em&gt;Johnny Bravo&lt;/em&gt; pilot and unreleased My Chemical Romance songs. His fascination with lost media started on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6Hiq"&gt;“I knew nothing about lost media at all until I watched a video from this other kind of lost media YouTuber,” said LSuperSonicQ. “His name is blameitonjorge. And this is like, back in 2015… It was like, top 40 lost or banned episodes of kids TV shows.” LSuperSonicQ watched the video, and from that point on, he said, he was “hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ij0fR"&gt;Lost media searches can take a long time, depending on what is being sought after and whether there are any complications, such as nondisclosure agreements, people leaving jobs, or creators just not remembering past projects. LSuperSonicQ took months to find the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2s0nFAw8GeU"&gt;lost pilot for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Kappa Mikey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on Nicktoons Network in the mid-2000s. This lost pilot was made in order to pitch the show to MTV. LSuperSonicQ was able to contact the creator of the show and convince him to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8KoVLI3XuGM"&gt;upload that original pilot to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He now considers this his favorite piece of lost media. Plus, the search was a good learning experience for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNSk3y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KoVLI3XuGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDuUMd"&gt;“That was a really, really big deal, when that happened,” said LSuperSonicQ. “It was my longest-lasting media search at the time, and I learned a lot of techniques in that search that I have applied to future searches and how I go about contacting people and trying to find stuff. So it was a really, really big turning point in my own personal lost media journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3hu7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIqqmw"&gt;Not all searches end in success, but they can still be entertaining, since lost media is all about the search and why the media became lost in the first place. YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GWq_TBvJKWLFIb2eLp-bw"&gt;Bobdunga&lt;/a&gt; recently dove into the world of lost media in her hunt for the &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;video game, chronicling her search in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s"&gt;two-part Youtube documentary&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;game was always seen as a mystery by the lost media community, but most didn’t seem too interested in solving it. “I feel that a lot of that had to do with the fact that the game was inherently deemed as shovelware right off the bat,” said Bobdunga. The 2000s featured many licensed games that were created just to cash in on the popularity of an upcoming film release. “This was especially common for ‘girl games,’” said Bobdunga. “I think a lot of people behind the scenes didn’t have that good of a grasp at what girls liked in gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRERfr"&gt;For her, &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;was more than just another “girl game.” “What really drew me to wanting to dive into &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; was mainly because it was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation,” she said. “I think it was my want to dissect all of it, even if I didn’t come out finding the actual game, that really drew me into the project.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT0ECm"&gt;She told me this was her first time creating YouTube content about lost media, but not her first experience with it. “I’ve always been very partial to both true crime and lost media videos,” she said. “They seem to fit together really well, because they both share an ominous, almost storytelling-like atmosphere. And a lot of the time, the narrator will have a really calm or even creepy voice to further immerse the viewer. There’s something inherently spooky about lost media, especially in a digital age where we feel we can find everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFC0Qy"&gt;After months of searching, she eventually found it. An anonymous source sent her the game’s ROM file after viewing the first part of her documentary. Since then, she has recently &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3AQh9Nx6_Gw"&gt;uploaded footage of the game&lt;/a&gt; to her YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywokja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8ZUR2De15s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3SLvt0"&gt;Enthusiasts see lost media as a way to preserve history, even if it’s something as obscure as a canceled video game or lost TV pilot. “Not everything has such a strong digital footprint, and it’s important to preserve all types of media, whether it be physical or digital,” said Bobdunga. “It isn’t only a nostalgic memory for some but the media in question could also act as a small glimpse into what the world was like when it was produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuy427"&gt;LSuperSonicQ took a similar stance. “It has to do with pop culture. It has to do with, you know, what people were interested in at the time it was made. And there’s lost media that goes all the way back to the 1920s. They’re silent films that are lost for people to look for. And it goes all the way up to the 2010s and 2020s. By being able to preserve and archive and document that kind of thing, I really think, in a way, it really helps the historical aspect of our culture and where we came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CyiBe"&gt;Without the work of the lost media community, these parts of our culture and history would be lost to time. In the digital age, it has become harder for media to get lost, since almost everything is online, but it is still a possibility. If companies don’t do their part by making their older media easily available, then it’s up to the fans to do their part and preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is expanding its Spanish-language programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UujR6SsbJdjXC48BURmQXV37uk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860874/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSELjq"&gt;YouTube TV is expanding its live TV channels to include more Spanish-language content and add-on options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olKgVY"&gt;The company announced that beginning today, three new Spanish-language networks — Univision, UniMás, and Galavisión — would be joining the YouTube TV experience at no additional cost to subscribers. Notably, the new networks will include coverage of two events that are just around the corner: the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards premiering on November 18th and the Campeones Cup airing on September 29th. This week’s announcement corresponds with the start of Hispanic Heritage Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I8hZJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CNN Español, Fox Deportes, and more will be offered as a paid add-on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1U0tlf"&gt;Local programming from Univision and UniMás will also be available to subscribers in select markets, including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, among other cities. Univision’s addition to the platform, meanwhile, will also give YouTube TV users access to the company’s on-demand content as well as the ability to log into the Univision app using their YouTube TV information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7Mgk"&gt;Univision networks aren’t widely available on streaming TV services — they’re missing from Hulu and Sling, for instance — which could give YouTube an edge as it looks to pick up new customers. (Univision has its own streaming goals: it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544041/univision-streaming-service-announcement-free-premium"&gt;launch a new streaming service&lt;/a&gt; next year with ad-supported and paid plans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2NkYS"&gt;For viewers looking to unlock more Spanish-language programming beyond the new networks, YouTube will also offer a new add-on option that includes networks like Sony Cine, CNN Español, Discovery en Español, Estrella TV, Cinelatino, and Fox Deportes, among others. YouTube said this add-on will be made available in the “coming months,” and the package’s cost and a full slate of included networks will be announced a little closer to its launch date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz9kzJ"&gt;Lastly, the company will soon introduce a separate add-on for Pantaya, an on-demand streaming service for Spanish-language movies, for $6 a month. That add-on will become available to YouTube TV users in the coming weeks. YouTube TV, which offers over 85 channels, currently costs $65 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is also forcing the popular Rythm Discord music bot offline </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wA-3YNXlFdmXgcSaGFnBGjR8c60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848936/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K93Z0F"&gt;Just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;forcing the Groovy Discord music bot offline&lt;/a&gt;, Google-owned YouTube is now turning its attention to Rythm, the most popular music bot on Discord. The search giant has sent a cease and desist to the owners of Rythm, a bot that lets Discord users play music from YouTube videos and has more than 560 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvw7mv"&gt;Google wants the Rythm bot closed down within seven days, and the service is complying by shutting down its bot on September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bVchm"&gt;Rythm is currently installed on more than 20 million Discord servers alone. Rythm has more than 560 million Discord users, and 30 million of them actively use the service each month. Given Discord has 150 million monthly active users, this shutdown is a huge blow to a core feature of Discord that’s used by around 20 percent of its userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlIwuS"&gt;“One way or another we knew this was due to happen eventually,” admits Yoav, the creator of Rythm bot, in a Discord message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Which is why we started working on something new a year ago. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;Groovy receiving one&lt;/a&gt; just meant it would happen sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opO928"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is forcing the popular Groovy Discord music bot offline ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MU3Mkw"&gt;The Rythm bot team is working on “something new in the music space that we’re very excited about,” says Yoav. There will be some form of connection to Discord, but the team isn’t ready to talk more about their upcoming project just yet. Rythm has been a full time job for Yoav, and it took 16 servers with more than 4TB of RAM and over 1,000 CPU cores to power this Discord music bot, illustrating how popular the service had become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JUqjv"&gt;“I believe that now that we received the letter, all music bots will be getting them too in the following weeks and I strongly believe all of them will shut down,” explains Yoav. “As someone that was a very early user on Discord it’s hard to envision Discord without music bots, they’ve become key to the experience and bring so much fun and engagement to a community. It’s a sad end of an era here for everyone on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlEXfN"&gt;While music bots might feel like a core part of Discord, they have been enabled by third parties for years, allowing Discord to avoid scrutiny or legal action from companies like YouTube. Groovy and Rythm shutting down will force many Discord users to look for alternatives, but smaller bot developers could soon end up in a similar position if they attempt to fill the giant gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI3JEX"&gt;YouTube and Discord do appear to be working on some form of alternative, though. Discord has been testing a social party feature on its service for the past 10 months, and it allows Discord users to form a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;YouTube watch party&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a straight replacement for music bots on Discord, but if the feature ever officially launches then it will be an official way to watch YouTube content inside Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0P3KR"&gt;We’ve reached out to both Google and Discord to comment on the Rythm shutdown. Discord declined to comment, and Google did not respond by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnsZQ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th 5:30AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Discord’s decision not to comment, and more details on Rythm active user numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube halves the number of subscribers you need to unlock Community posting</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5RKur"&gt;YouTube is cutting the number of subscribers you need to be able to make Community posts in half, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d1b233e4-4ac2-41a0-abbb-8c3db9665bc8"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Starting October 12th, instead of requiring 1,000 subscribers, you’ll need more than 500 subscribers. In a tweet, YouTube said that will open up the feature to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057"&gt;“millions” more channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oFScVw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Community posts are coming to millions more channels!!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Starting October 12, 2021, we’re lowering the eligibility threshold for Community posts to channels with 500+ subscribers: &lt;a href="https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML"&gt;https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tips for getting started on the Community tab →&lt;a href="https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t"&gt;https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SB1pyfbgUz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SB1pyfbgUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2oeK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9409631?hl=en"&gt;Community posts&lt;/a&gt; are Facebook-like news or status updates from creators that can be found on a dedicated Community tab on their profile. Sometimes, you might also see them in the Home or Subscriptions tab. The feature was designed to replace the Discussion tab, which will be officially removed from all channels on October 12th, YouTube said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojwkra"&gt;For creators with fewer than 500 subscribers who want to use the Community posts feature, YouTube says it is “working to bring Community posts to you in the future,” suggesting that the feature could be rolled out more widely at some point. And once you do cross that 500-subscriber threshold, it might take up to a week until you can make Community posts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reports having 50 million Premium and Music subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzaIAY8Oia1QHvQViLMkC9FptGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810147/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GmTOIg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has 50 million users subscribed to or trying YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, which is a marked increase from the 30 million &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/google-earnings-antitrust-scrutiny/"&gt;subscribers it reported in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to mark a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;continued trend&lt;/a&gt; in people looking to make the jump from the free versions of YouTube and YouTube Music, even as more services are competing in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKGlus"&gt;Google doesn’t break down that 50 million number any further, so we don’t really know how many people are subscribed to YouTube Music or Premium and how many are using the services’ free one-month trial. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;its blog post&lt;/a&gt; spends a lot of time talking about music, hailing YouTube as the fastest-growing music-subscription service. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/youtube-music-passes-50-million-subscribers-up-20-million-in-less-than-a-year-1235054559/"&gt;compared Google’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; with other streaming services. It reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596155/spotify-earnings-q2-2021-podcasting-investments-acquisitions-subscribers"&gt;Spotify has around 165 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae722400-561c-431a-85eb-e09e1f6b0bb2"&gt;quotes estimates&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music having 78 million. (The last official word was in June 2019 when Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;its service had passed 60 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYHZDp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t really break down what that 50 million number means&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pb5Iww"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium"&gt;YouTube Music Premium&lt;/a&gt; costs $9.99 a month and lets users listen to and download ad-free music. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; goes for $11.99 a month and gives subscribers access to all of the benefits of YouTube Music, with the ability to also download and watch regular videos ad-free. Premium subscribers can also have videos play in the background while they’re using another app or their phone is locked. For those who spend a lot of time watching non-music content on the platform, that’s a much better experience for not that much more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H9q35"&gt;Google hasn’t commented on what caused the 20 million-subscriber increase, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind that last year’s count was reported right around the time when Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354136/google-play-music-shut-down-end-service-youtube-music-date"&gt;shutting down its Play Music service&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to tell how many people were subscribed to it — but both Google Play and YouTube Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537261/google-youtube-music-play-music-15-million-subscribers"&gt;reportedly had 15 million subscribers combined&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BsHjOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s clear a growing number of people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lz9bKq"&gt;Without knowing the breakdown, it’s hard to tell exactly what this means for Google. Were more people interested in letting videos play in the background without ads, or were they looking for an alternative or addition to Spotify and Apple Music? Taking a step back, it’s clear more people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings. While there have been plenty of (admittedly justified) complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;glut of video&lt;/a&gt; and audio streaming services, it seems there’s still room to grow, if Google is any example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TimTheTatman, one of Twitch’s biggest streamers, moves to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gamers’ Choice Awards 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbe3QsgVY4hozan7XjnrMVRJs0A=/1x132:1992x1459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804097/1077212614.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjn1tr"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, is leaving &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. His move comes just days after another big streamer, Ben “DrLupo” Lupo, announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he’d be switching from Twitch to YouTube as well&lt;/a&gt;. Betar’s first stream will take place on September 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCusxz"&gt;In moving from Twitch, Betar is leaving behind &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman"&gt;the 7 million followers&lt;/a&gt; he’s accrued on the Amazon-owned platform. But he won’t be starting from scratch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/timthetatman"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where he already has 3.8 million subscribers. YouTube declined to comment on the terms of its deal with Betar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G63l7A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the future&lt;a href="https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA"&gt;https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ekGwDreHOL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ekGwDreHOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— timthetatman  (@timthetatman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRaYM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/timthetatman-will-leave-twitch-for-youtube-2021-8"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Betar said the move will let him spend more time with his family. “When I started, I had no family obligations and I could [stream] a lot of hours,” he said to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “The reality is, now that I’ve got my wife and my son, it’s hard for me to stream as much as I did beforehand.” Lupo, in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/30/drlupo-twitch-youtube-exclusive-deal/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similarly indicated that his YouTube Gaming deal would give him more family time and said that the deal he was presented with would let him be “secure for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiaxD7"&gt;Betar and Lupo’s moves follow earlier switches made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; and signal that YouTube Gaming might be investing more in bringing big names to the platform. YouTube Gaming still sees far fewer hours watched than Twitch does, &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;according to Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, so the signings could help YouTube close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmSbGb"&gt;In an acknowledgment of the move, Twitch shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937"&gt;a montage of Betar on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, including the iconic moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376298/timthetatman-fall-guys-victory-win-finally-twitch-live"&gt;when he finally won a game of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tqrbby"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You'll always be a King to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for everything, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timthetatman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/keeZeElnpm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/keeZeElnpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu1ORR"&gt;“It’s been great to see all that TimTheTatman has achieved since being partnered in 2012 on Twitch — whether it was marrying the love of his life and welcoming an heir to the Tatman throne, or the trials and tribulations of achieving his first Fall Guys crown,” a Twitch spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s been a pleasure being part of Tim’s community, and we are proud of everything he has done for gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrjvMO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 1st, 1:16PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that YouTube declined to comment on its deal with Betar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max and YouTube are now on Spectrum TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yYe3IWlOEY5tkKqF3AjjiOjOQI=/295x0:1210x610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794872/HBO_Max_in_Apps_Menu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spectrum TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T6a5MI"&gt;Two of the biggest players in streaming, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube, have officially arrived on Spectrum TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykoa4Y"&gt;It’s the first time the apps have been supported on Spectrum TV, Charter’s digital cable provider and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629518/spectrum-tv-app-roku-channel-store"&gt;live TV app&lt;/a&gt;, and users will be able to access content from both apps through the platform’s guide on channels 2004 for HBO Max and 2003 for YouTube. Users will also be able to find them by searching the guide or from the guide’s apps menu. (A subscription to HBO Max, which costs $10 per month with ads or $15 to go ad-free and unlock same-day theatrical releases, will still be required to access the content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjnVvu"&gt;The two apps are huge additions to Spectrum’s platform. &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which launched well over a year ago, offers more than 13,000 hours of premium content from brands that include HBO, DC, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, and Max Originals, among others. The service also made Warner Bros.’ entire 2021 film slate available on its premium tier the same day those films debut in theaters at no additional cost. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;controversial move&lt;/a&gt; and one that’s caused WarnerMedia quite a few headaches, it’s a tremendous value for anyone uncertain about returning to theaters just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFspw"&gt;A spokesperson noted that the guide channels offer an additional method for customers to access the HBO Max and YouTube apps. Together with Netflix, they’re the first three streaming apps to be accessible directly through the Spectrum Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMRGJ"&gt;“As the video landscape continues to change, we are evolving our products and making it easier for our customers to watch what they want by providing access to streaming apps from convenient launch points within the Spectrum TV experience,” Elena Ritchie, Spectrum’s group vice president of video experience, said in a statement. “We look forward to growing this library and expect to launch more streaming video apps in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DrLupo is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Off Court At The 2019 Australian Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veCQMEfVqzSvuTtWRbEluv9TszQ=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793846/1124891630.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt King / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cw4ys3"&gt;Streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo has signed a deal to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming, following in the footsteps of other well-known streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; in moving from Twitch to YouTube. Lupo’s first YouTube Gaming stream will take place on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64PoLQ"&gt;Lupo already has a sizable presence on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNF0LEQ2abMr0PAX3cfkAMg"&gt;with more than 1.7 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. But in switching to the Google-owned platform, he’s moving on from his large audience on Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drlupo"&gt;where he has 4.5 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIH1d"&gt;A Loaded PR representative declined to comment on the terms of Lupo’s YouTube Gaming deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;In December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lupo signed a deal with Twitch that was reported to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1204448185785208833"&gt;worth millions of dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;. The Amazon-owned streaming service acknowledged Lupo’s departure &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “we wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj1lqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a creator, a gamer and a father, you’re many things to many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrLupo&lt;/a&gt;, you’re someone who works hard to put good into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pkUCoX1dWe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pkUCoX1dWe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSDTjy"&gt;While big-name streamers aren’t signing splashy exclusivity deals quite as often as they used to in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ defection from Twitch to Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, that’s likely in part because Mixer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down by Microsoft in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the potential number of places to go is one platform fewer. (Blevins, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430767/ninja-twitch-homecoming-return-mixer-shroud"&gt;has returned to streaming exclusively on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V60daE"&gt;Both Dunlop and Hofstetter have seen success since moving exclusively to YouTube. However, Twitch sees vastly more hours watched than both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming combined, making up nearly 75 percent of total hours watched across all three platforms in the first quarter of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;Streamlabs report&lt;/a&gt;. That means Lupo may not see as much viewership on YouTube Gaming as he does on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuuqmiqAdW7tPWqmcx5C6neInFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814729/1_4lFFUZbSZuCWgetM2PbBng.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QByCTJ"&gt;But in signing this exclusivity deal, it seems Lupo sees opportunity with Google’s platform. And in a statement, he suggests the platform will also help him as he “expand[s] my brand through other entertainment initiatives,” so perhaps there’s more that YouTube is offering Lupo we just aren’t aware of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LdCB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 30th, 1:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google finally releases YouTube Music Wear OS app, but only for Samsung’s new watches</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZdESe"&gt;Google has finally released a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music"&gt;Wear OS app for YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;, which could seem like welcome news for people who have been waiting for a way to play their music off Google’s streaming service after the company shut down Google Play Music on Wear OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355887/google-play-music-wear-os-smartwatch-shut-down-youtube-music"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. But the new app comes with a few caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJf8JX"&gt;The biggest catch is that the new app only works on one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s two new watches&lt;/a&gt; powered by Wear OS 3, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765#zippy=%2Csmartwatches"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;. Those watches won’t be available until August 27th, so even if you want to try the new app right now, you won’t be able to unless you have a Galaxy Watch 4 or a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v72Yi2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if you have a compatible watch, it sounds like the app has some frustrating limitations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqvlUQ"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lucky enough to have one of the new watches, the YouTube Music Wear OS will let YouTube Premium subscribers download music right to their watch, meaning you can listen to tunes with just a watch and a pair of Bluetooth headphones, even when you don’t have an internet connection. However, based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/youtube-music-for-wear-os-hands-on/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s &lt;/em&gt;hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the app, it sounds like there might be some frustrating caveats you’ll have to keep in mind when you’re actually using the Wear OS YouTube Music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6BmNg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says there doesn’t appear to be a way to &lt;em&gt;stream&lt;/em&gt; music from the app — it appears that you can only download music right now. And annoyingly, you can only download songs while the watch is on a charger, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyPEyq"&gt;Still, it’s nice that a YouTube Music Wear OS app is available at all, even in its currently limited form. Google hasn’t shared details about when the app might be available on other Wear OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
