    <title>Hasan Piker on the problem with YouTube debate culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wf9mi_iyM0HhWRZysFvCy0MmUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521065/acastro_210623_4645_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QFGFK7"&gt;Last week, a pair of YouTube’s most popular creators was set to spar in the marketplace of ideas &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/sam-seder-surprises-steven-crowder-ethan-klein-debate-youtube-2021-6"&gt;in a debate&lt;/a&gt; over the government’s simple, common sense advice to wear masks during a global pandemic to stop the persistent spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97s7R"&gt;The spat grew from a series of videos between right-wing provocateur Steven Crowder and the host of the &lt;em&gt;H3 Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, Ethan Klein, calling one another out for their purported bad takes on mask-wearing. In March, Crowder called out Klein for saying that “you shouldn’t think about” what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells you and just wear the mask, rather than criticizing the agency and its scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UakhL0"&gt;Crowder, who is widely known as the face of the “change my mind” meme, has challenged people to debates in the past, including college students on campuses all across the country. Klein, known for his comedy skits and pop culture commentary, is admittedly not the best debater. So instead of debating Crowder himself, Klein looped in Sam Seder, popular leftist host of &lt;em&gt;The Majority Report&lt;/em&gt;, as a surprise guest to take his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlYqWU"&gt;The “debate” immediately flamed out. Once Seder appeared on-screen, Crowder got squirrelly, slinging insults, and ultimately ditching the entire debate. Soon after recording, both Crowder and Klein released the footage. Both believed to have won by “owning” the other so publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lupA4"&gt;The whole fiasco raised serious questions about debate culture online and how platforms like YouTube and Twitch are influencing politics at large. I asked &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/style/hasan-piker-twitch.html"&gt;Hasan Piker&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Twitch commentator and former &lt;em&gt;Young Turks &lt;/em&gt;broadcast&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist, to talk about it. Piker has been a vocal critic of debate culture without shying away from his channel’s political clout. As he tells it, the “debate me” challenge is just a branding exercise — and it’s one he’s increasingly willing to skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp3nBI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPh8SA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to the Steven Crowder and Sam Seder debate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZqTt"&gt;Personally, I think all of this is just bullshit. I’ve done debates on the internet, and it’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive. I think it can help start a lot of people down the road of deradicalization, but what I have to recognize is that it fosters a really toxic environment. People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top dog debater is. So it turns into team sports. It’s not necessarily grounding your ideology in materialism, and instead, it’s just basically repeating talking points from the new intellectual daddy or father figure that you appreciate or enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWZ4vB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting you bring that up — the concept of team sports. When I watched the “debate” last week, my mind went straight to the Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley debates in the late ’60s. It felt like a moment where culture was beginning to override ideas, largely due to television as the medium for political debate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTCZAB"&gt;I’ll tell you another thing that’s ironic about the Vidal-Buckley debates. Those debates can be TLDR’d into one of them calling the other “queer” as a pejorative and then the other calls the other a “fascist.” If we look at that as the peak of intellectual debates, even back then, ultimately, they can still be reduced to the same shit-slinging operation. And you’re right, it is all about culture and personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVLXBe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of the debate last week, how do you think YouTube as a medium influenced the discussion? Each person was recording and could shape the discussion by changing the camera angles, muting someone, or turning their volume down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCEbqa"&gt;That’s a really unique perspective. I obviously talked about that on stream, but I never thought of the broader implications of it or considered how one-sided that is. It plays into the uneven playing field of the argument. Those decisions to alter camera angles were a deliberate attempt by Steven Crowder to stop his audience from recognizing what had happened in an effort to silence and seize full control ... And that was done in an effort to make himself seem more defensible in the eyes of his audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ytzm1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet has revolutionized the way people get their information. But at the same time, do you think it allows creators to control the narrative and decide their own winner on their platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQy63q"&gt;These debates are rarely about ideas, but instead a personal branding project. That’s probably why it hit so hard for Crowder to try and defend himself. Sorry, I’m simultaneously downloading &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to be playing that later on stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtzR6q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMAGLC"&gt;It’s probably dog shit. I hate golf. But it’s whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCWgaJ"&gt;Oh, yeah. For Steven Crowder, who has built his entire branding about how he is an intellectual type, much like Ben Shapiro has built his brand around being a guy who does debates and defeats liberals in the marketplace of ideas — it hits different. That’s why he had significantly more to lose. That’s what was going on. That’s why he had to take all the actions he did, and that’s why he kept dodging Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VLvb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now I want to get into a conversation about why you do what you do. I know there are a lot of people my age who get their news online and through these streamers. How do you feel about that responsibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e3mNG"&gt;It’s definitely something I think about a lot. I have a pretty stable moral grounding and worldview, and I try to do right by everyone and be as transparent as possible. I communicate that I do have biases just like everyone else. It’s pretty obvious when you come in. I do criticize the Democratic Party quite frequently and the Republican Party even more frequently than that. But that doesn’t mean I’m providing this purely neutral objective analysis. I think all the people who claim to be doing that are lying and benefiting from having the default position be neoliberal capitalism. If there’s injustice and you’re taking a neutral position in the face of injustice, you’re siding with the oppressor. You’re still not neutral. That’s my take on it. That’s why I do my commentary in the way that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNomD2"&gt;I try my best as humanly possible to read up in the limited amount of time I have leading up to a stream to prepare for the stream itself. And on top of that, I’m actively trying to make sure that I’m not misinforming anyone. I also have a pretty solid checking mechanism. If you’ve been in chat long enough, you know that as much as people like to talk about safe spaces or an echo chamber that I’ve cultivated in my community, I am not averse to criticism. I thrive in it. I love it. I look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrtP5I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see streaming and YouTube becoming more popular with younger people looking for new pundits and news online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS6pJ4"&gt;Well, there’s still going to be a need for journalists to make the news. I hope that never changes. I do worry that like — I’m an idiot. I’m an asshole. I don’t want the entire news media to be comprised of other idiot assholes like me. I know that what I do is basically supposed to be the reward after a career of doing journalism, and I get that. Op-eds are supposed to be rewards that you give to people who did 25 years out in like combat zones, for the most part sharking State Department propaganda and lying to them and stuff like that. Still, those people are putting in the work, and they finally get their comfortable office gig in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;or another reputable place, and then that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkyDNO"&gt;Now, what I do is a way to completely bypass that and even go beyond the office-gig economy, which is now turning into Substack and stuff like that. But if everyone wanted to do that, it would ruin everything. I still believe that journalists, like real journalists, should do real news, which I am not. I am not a real journalist. I’m not doing real news. I’m a commentator. I hope that never goes away. That would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIiNt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people that you’re interacting with on Twitch in chat, you’re accountable to them. They might unsubscribe. What’s that relationship like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjS7Vc"&gt;For the degenerate dumbasses that are op-ed writers and commentators like myself, what I do is absolutely a million times harder. I will say this with my chest: what I do, it looks like I’m sitting in a living room and shooting the shit, it is very easy. I’m not going to a fucking coal mine. But in comparison to what Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss do, what I do is a million times more difficult if you are so used to being in an ivory tower where you get very little criticism. All you need to do is just shut it off. Like your comments under your &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article are not going to drastically redefine your op-ed piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5N6RXH"&gt;My entire content revolves around constant back-and-forth communication, and it’s a very different layer of trying to control that. But I love that. I think that’s a good thing. As far as the take economy goes, I think what I do is pretty solid. I think it’s a good thing to have endless amounts of feedback from virtually every single person who wishes to do so, which is why I don’t have a sub-only feed. Some communities, when they grow to my size, the streamer will shut down their chat to subscriber-only. I don’t do that on purpose because I want to have these sorts of conversations with people, and I don’t want the money to prevent them from happening. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube wins naming rights for 6,000-seat event venue at Hollywood Park</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD_Ug9S_6q5slF7NqLPqmzwHsOk=/225x0:1635x940/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515360/youtube_theater_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Theater | YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VUAXLp"&gt;Google-owned YouTube will have its name on a new live event venue in Inglewood, California, part of the new Hollywood Park mixed-use development, the &lt;a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/youtube-partners-with-partners-hollywood-park-to-name-performance-venue-youtube-theater/"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube Theater will be a 6,000-seat performance venue, which will host concerts, comedy shows, YouTube creator events, esports competitions, and community shows. Financial terms of the multiyear naming rights deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VqNbr"&gt;The development is the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and part of the same complex as SoFi Stadium — where the Rams and Chargers play — and American Airlines Plaza. Hollywood Park also houses 3,000 apartments, a 300-room hotel, and an 890,000 square-foot retail area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oe7srF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH9RsPGyVzs?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=6&amp;amp;start=6" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVZEy"&gt;“YouTube Theater will drive the uniqueness of YouTube by combining physical, ‘in real life’ events that bring creators and fans together, while simultaneously sharing ​that same event​ experience with our two billion global monthly users through livestreams and VOD content,” YouTube vice president of brand marketing Angela Courtin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sySMu2"&gt;Upcoming performers at the three-story, 227,000-square foot YouTube Theater include Pitbull and Iggy Azalea, Black Pumas, and TLC with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The venue also has a 6,100-square-foot stage and a 3,500-square-foot private club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL9kjG"&gt;The theater will have a large-scale digital YouTube “play” button icon outside the venue, which can turn into an immersive video screen where guests can mirror themselves or view highlights from YouTube creators and artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUo4Gk"&gt;YouTube Theater is set to open for its first events later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMC2y4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV launches 4K and offline downloads today, but they don’t come cheap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpHb12cgzVzTNmGF1tJYch66rtE=/47x0:1679x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513791/yttv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs6oFt"&gt;YouTube TV is today revealing more details about two anticipated new features: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;4K playback and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, the service will be bundling them together in a new add-on package it’s calling &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365"&gt;“4K Plus.”&lt;/a&gt; There’s no getting one without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgIQe0"&gt;4K Plus is available starting today and will cost an extra $19.99 per month on top of the standard &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;$64.99 YouTube TV subscription&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds awfully expensive, but at least there’s this: customers will receive a free one-month trial — and if you sign up early, 4K Plus will be discounted to $9.99 each month for the first year. That’s easier to swallow than $20, but you’ll eventually be shifted over to the full price once that initial promotion expires. So for the first year, you’re looking at a $75 monthly bill, and $85 if you keep 4K Plus after that. Add in taxes and fees and, well, ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEnx_AJuL3FrzUmJv3RS2wYqA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690625/ezgif.com_video_to_gif_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jump to specific moments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HRDYrI"&gt;For now, offline downloads will likely be a bigger deal for many customers than 4K streaming. Outside of select sporting events, there’s still a dearth of 4K content on network and cable TV. (For that reason, some competing services like FuboTV don’t charge extra for 4K streams.) YouTube really isn’t in any position to solve that dilemma, but it’s promising that 4K Plus subscribers will be able to “watch major sports events this summer in 4K, plus live content from networks like NBC, sports like college football and basketball later this year, and on-demand content from FX, Discovery Networks, Tastemade and more.” You can search for “4K” to see all available 4K programs. YouTube TV is also preparing for the Olympics with new features that will let you quickly jump to specific sports or moments of an event without having to manually scrub through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9D2tT"&gt;When asked whether offline downloads will face any channel or content restrictions, YouTube told me that anything recorded to your cloud DVR from the base channel package can be downloaded to YouTube TV’s mobile app. So in theory, you shouldn’t run into any frustrating limitations or channels that block the feature. I’d hope for as much considering the price! However, the company noted that some premium network add-ons might not allow offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RKQLF"&gt;At least among streaming TV services, offline viewing is a rare convenience. Sling TV doesn’t offer it, and Hulu only &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads"&gt;supports offline downloads&lt;/a&gt; from its on-demand library of shows and movies. In the case of YouTube TV, you’re actually pulling down the entire DVR recording as it originally aired, so this approach is somewhat unique and Tivo-esque. YouTube told me that customers will have full control over playback, and rewind / fast-forward should work without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TofyPV"&gt;Adding 4K Plus to your account also enables “unlimited” concurrent streams for any devices that are on your home Wi-Fi network. YouTube TV usually limits customers to three simultaneous streams, and this will still apply for devices that are outside your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SAMJcH"&gt;Dolby 5.1 surround is coming to YouTube TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hZYHfx"&gt;In welcome news for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; YouTube TV customers, the service will also be introducing support for Dolby 5.1 surround sound “soon.” And this doesn’t require any special plan or add-on. YouTube says 5.1 audio has consistently been among the biggest feature requests from subscribers. It’ll be rolling out to “select devices” over the coming weeks. Smart TVs are first on the list, with other platforms to follow in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube took down videos by group documenting human rights abuses in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F1aLPakXJdu5gT_KkNoMxoUvks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510143/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="inZKkl"&gt;YouTube took down several videos from a human rights organization’s channel, which was attempting to document human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang province, for violating its anti-harassment policy, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-youtube-takes-down-xinjiang-videos-forces-rights-group-seek-2021-06-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQvWt"&gt;On June 15th, Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights said the Google-owned video platform disabled its channel entirely, telling the group it had received too many strikes against its channel for videos where people displayed identification cards showing they were related to missing Xinjiang residents. That apparently broke YouTube’s rule against displaying personal information, which led to the videos’ removal. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5uns79sHr1AZiUw1ikV7PQ"&gt;The channel&lt;/a&gt; was restored three days later, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Iglq"&gt;YouTube reportedly asked Atajurt to cut out or conceal the IDs in the videos, but the channel’s administrator said  they didn’t want to do so out of concern that such action would damage its credibility. Atajurt has been praised by organizations including &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/21/silencing-activist-shows-kazakhstans-contempt-rights"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; for helping to expose human rights violations. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/24/1027048/youtube-xinjiang-censorship-human-rights-atajurt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atajurt posts testimonies from the family members of people detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9j5ec"&gt;Most of the videos that were removed have been restored following appeals, but some remained unviewable, and according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Atajurt is backing up its videos on blockchain-based video platform Odysee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goAjMA"&gt;A YouTube spokesperson said its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268?hl=en#zippy=%2Cother-types-of-content-that-violate-this-policy"&gt;harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; “clearly prohibits content revealing someone’s personally identifiable information, including their government identification or phone numbers,” adding that it enforces its policies “equally for everyone.” However, the spokesperson added, it recognized that the intent of posting the videos was not to “maliciously reveal” personal information. “Upon careful review of their appeal, we reinstated the channel and are working with Atajurt Kazakh to explain our policies so they can make the best decisions for their channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhMiCq"&gt;A June 10th &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; found that the Chinese government had conducted state-organized persecution, including torture, against people in Xinjiang provice in western China, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs. The United Nations has estimated that at least 1 million &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/22/china-rejects-uighurs-genocide-charge-invites-uns-rights-chief"&gt;Uyghurs are being held&lt;/a&gt; in internment camps in China, a claim that China has disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I75BZ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th 8:18AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from YouTube spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s security changes will break old Drive and YouTube links</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DPqn7pgqUPbpiN9Y4RaXCh3HHxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496917/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9cJPxF"&gt;Soon, public links to an untold number of items stored on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685032"&gt;Google Drive &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/114633828/changes-to-unlisted-videos-uploaded-before-2017?hl=en"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; will stop working. In the name of enhanced security, Google is changing the way it handles link sharing on both services, and while active users may be able to opt out of the switch, files and videos abandoned on unused or inactive accounts may simply slip out of view forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ56YG"&gt;That’s because shared links are now part of a newer system that Google says increases security. On YouTube, the newer links are apparently more difficult for anyone to guess or access without being explicitly given access. The newer links also have the affect of tying more activity to specific accounts and requiring viewers to log in, which allows access to be tracked and made a part of each user’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLC4nY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6UHS1-vDMM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ulRrhG"&gt;On YouTube the changes will affect any videos that are public, but marked as “Unlisted.” As &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-youtube-unlisted-links"&gt;described in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6UHS1-vDMM"&gt;five-minute video&lt;/a&gt;, any Unlisted videos that were uploaded prior to 2017 will have their status changed to Private starting on July 23rd. The way Private videos work now, that will kill any old links or embeds, plus it limits sharing to a maximum of 50 people — all of whom will need a Google account to view it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkDAUa"&gt;For people who would prefer to keep sharing their old Unlisted videos with public links, embeds and comments, they can opt out on a per-account basis by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/older_unlisted_update"&gt;filling out this form&lt;/a&gt; over the next month. The only other option is to reupload those videos and leave them marked as Unlisted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5q81m"&gt;Google Drive is going through the same change, as announced earlier today &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/drive-file-link-updates.html"&gt;on the Workspace Updates blog&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking a link to access cloud-stored files will now include a resource key that determines who does or does not get access. If you’ve already accessed a file (presumably while logged in to your Google account) then you will continue to have access to it, and if you have “direct access,” then that will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Drive security update email" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fyq03_XvuEyfAHSmvK0mkF5ezPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678103/drive_security_update_email.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Drive security update email&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2Aitkd"&gt;If that is not the case, then you’ll need to make a request to access the file or folder. If you have a personal Google/Gmail account and use Drive, then you’ll get an email after July 26th alerting you to any files that will be impacted by this change. If your account includes links that will be affected, then you’ll be able to opt out of the “security update” as long as you do so before September 13th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6RYMR"&gt;If you use a Google Workspace account managed by your employer, school or other organization then it’s a little more complicated. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685032"&gt;The administrator/IT department can choose&lt;/a&gt; to opt out entirely, apply the update to everyone with no opt-out possible, or apply the update and allow individual users to remove it from specific files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhXBo1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this amazing montage of 100 3D animations reimagining the same moment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jL_ZU6pP0p47sBDz_6RBh-qsxHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486392/Still_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Animation by Caleb Worcester&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtwiYD"&gt;A man carries a heavy backpack through a war-ravaged city. A medic pushes a zombified corpse on a stretcher toward an ambulance, as an ominous building with a logo for “Harvest Corp” sits in the background. Then we’re on a bright, vibrantly colored alien world whose surface is a shallow liquid, where an astronaut pulls on a wire dragging a vehicle behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Whzh"&gt;That’s just the first 30 seconds of nearly 11 minutes of strange, beautiful, and imaginative worlds all created based on the same original animation. The video was assembled by Clinton Jones, aka pwnisher, who challenged animators to create their own 3D animated scene based on a bare-bones animation he created. The video rounds up his 100 favorite clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aRgHf"&gt;The premise behind the challenge is to take the initial animation by Jones and have as many artists as possible re-envision it. Jones’ animation is a side view of a person walking, leaning forward, taking large (slightly theatrical) steps. The ground extends into the background under a large orb (a planet? Giant hot air balloon? Up to you!). From that, artists are challenged to make something original. &lt;em&gt;What is that large orb in the background? What is causing the character to struggle walking forward? &lt;/em&gt;Each animation has its own explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwgznLbvHqlfY3eWKqUDxSmLZP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674032/Animation_sidebyside.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the original animation by Clinton Jones (top) and an animation by Kamil Drobek (bottom), one of 2,400 submitted as part of the challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiIJm"&gt;The results are simply mesmerizing. Every couple of seconds, we are transported to another artist’s take on a reality based on the original animation. If you’re a fan or familiar with popular 3D rendered art found on Instagram from artists like Beeple or The French Monkey, you might not be surprised to see the amount of alien worlds or remixes of a cyperpunk-bladerunner-akira-like future. That said, they are all beautiful and painfully detailed. So much so that each really feels like a unique world hinting at a backstory that I would love to read or watch more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiVFaY"&gt;The real treats, though, are the animations that are truly unexpected. One riffs on the animation style most associated with Studio Ghibli. Another might actually be stop-motion (if it’s actually a 3D render made to look like stop-motion then it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool). There’s a really incredibly animated fire-breathing dragon that I rewatched a few times and another surreal behind-the-scenes “green screen” take with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBhwCx"&gt;For those who are curious on what the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the unused 2,300 renders are like, you can watch all 2,400 rendered animations &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkRjihsMdp8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But just a warning, it’s two hours 44 minutes and 39 seconds long… Although it’s broken up into themes, fantasy, adventure, video games, and comics, so you can skip to a topic of interest or just sit back and watch them all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will bring picture-in-picture to iPhones and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTbV4Gq3GYbLqq25Wm1LBY-4ckM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473425/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rpYADg"&gt;The YouTube app on iOS &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/youtube-pip-support-rolling-out/"&gt;will be getting picture-in-picture support&lt;/a&gt;, allowing all users to watch videos while doing other things on their iPhones and iPads. A YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the feature is currently rolling out to Premium subscribers, and that a launch for all iOS users (including the free ones) in the US is in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqNyOh"&gt;Apple added support for picture-in-picture video for iPads with iOS 9, and brought it to iPhones with iOS 14. Since then, YouTube’s support for the feature on iPhones and iPads has been spotty — it works for iPad if you’re using Safari (though some have reported it doesn’t work &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252090452"&gt;for non-Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;); iPhone users have only been able to access the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9bg8b"&gt;That complication seems to be going away, at least for those in the US: iOS users, with or without a YouTube Premium subscription, will soon have access to it using the YouTube app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7552722"&gt;as Android users have for years&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube did not provide a timeline for when the feature would arrive for free users, but stated the rollout to Premium subscribes is in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4D2RE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article stated that PiP video came to the iPad with iOS 13. It in fact arrived with iOS 9. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is banning alcohol, gambling, and politics from its ‘most prominent’ ad slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16VGS100QPvwsHwyHyNlRgnX-Cg=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451248/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.36.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the YouTube masthead ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaWGXa"&gt;YouTube will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050"&gt;no longer be accepting ads&lt;/a&gt; relating to alcohol, gambling, politics, or “prescription drug terms” for its masthead ad slot, which appears at the top of the website and app, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-masthead-advertising-ban-9b8d3f1c-f0e4-4520-bcad-fa2e1e46b1a5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the limitations on what kind of ads can appear in this slot will help “lead to a better experience for users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1drIW"&gt;The masthead slot is one of the first things users see when they open YouTube, so it’s understandable that keeping ads about drugs, alcohol, or gambling out of it would make YouTube more inclusive for everyone. As for politics, it could help the platform avoid controversies, like the one that arose when then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/youtube-will-end-full-day-masthead-reservations-like-trump-used.html"&gt;purchased the slot for three days&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8W94yqS__A90P9oIPb3wH_UVeGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658293/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_11.23.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new masthead requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RDZJbV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9709826"&gt;YouTube’s ad support page&lt;/a&gt;, ads in the masthead slot can “drive massive reach or awareness,” but now that megaphone will no longer be available to people wanting to advertise in certain spaces. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;already provides a way&lt;/a&gt; for users to limit the number of alcohol and gambling-related ads they see on YouTube, and in theory the setting would’ve applied to the masthead ad — according to Google, last year the company changed the slot to show targeted ads, rather than ones that had been reserved for an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fQYZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/12/01/google-to-limit-some-drug-ads/070b7462-815d-47e1-9600-7af29ee871da/"&gt;For years&lt;/a&gt; Google has tried to balance its policies to determine what it does and doesn’t show in ads — recently, it’s reined in ads that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375702/google-updates-youtube-ad-targeting-hate-speech"&gt;used hate speech as keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21456323/google-election-ad-ban-donald-trump-early-victory"&gt;political misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328526/google-coronavirus-conspiracy-page-ad-ban-new-rule"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; around COVID-19. As it’s worked to clean up what ads it puts in front of users, Google’s ads business has also increasingly come under scrutiny from lawmakers who believe it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ripe for antitrust enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is trying to dominate watch parties, but it needs more help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ft-o9a0LPyS-oG4BM2_sWZNV3ZQ=/0x59:941x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440167/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay displayed on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QfG3e"&gt;Apple is bringing one of streaming’s trendiest features to iPhone users with the debut of SharePlay in iOS 15 later this year, allowing FaceTime users to stream music, online videos, and movies together with friends. The move positions FaceTime to compete more directly with platforms like Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Houseparty, which all offer ways to video chat while watching things as a group.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It offers Apple a chance to hook a new generation of users on FaceTime — but the service is still missing some key integrations to make that happen, particularly for the teens most likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR91ld"&gt;SharePlay, announced earlier this week and likely arriving in the fall, will allow FaceTime users to share and stream media in real time from an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. It’s a neat tool for the pandemic era, and it takes inspiration from the watch party modes that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hidden-code-on-the-disney-site-suggests-a-watch-party-1844906374"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; — including Disney Plus, Hulu, and Prime Video, among others — added themselves in the last year. For services where it’s not supported, like Netflix, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;there are popular extensions&lt;/a&gt; that enable simultaneous streaming and chatting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WHxU0"&gt;The goal isn’t to compete with those native platforms, though. After all, you’re still watching Hulu, just in a different space. Instead, the update puts FaceTime square against services like Facebook Messenger that dominate messaging and have already been trying to build out co-watching experiences, but without as robust of a service list as Apple has the ability to line up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uFYit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SharePlay makes sense for teen streamers, but the feature needs wider app support if it’s going to work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvQexT"&gt;SharePlay particularly makes sense for the next generation of iPhone users, as teens are more &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;inclined to watch videos&lt;/a&gt; on their phones. Video-based social media apps like Instagram and TikTok are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17382058/youtube-teens-preferred-platform"&gt;immensely popular&lt;/a&gt; among teens, and an &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-census-8-to-18-key-findings-updated.pdf"&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of teens have access to these apps on their own personal smartphones. Video chatting is hugely popular, too, with a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/08/06/teens-technology-and-friendships/"&gt;2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; from Pew Research finding that 59 percent of US teens video chatted with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DrWEL"&gt;The introduction of SharePlay also jibes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=i3mD6rA5"&gt;reported plans&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage compete more directly with Facebook-owned WhatsApp by becoming more of a social network. It makes a lot of sense that the company would similarly invest in developments for its video-calling product as well, which is just a couple of taps away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCdLPN"&gt;But if Apple wants SharePlay to be a success among the demographic of consumers most likely to use it, it’ll need to expand the number of apps that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jDU2mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fewer than a dozen services were included on Apple’s SharePlay slide at WWDC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnpZzZ"&gt;Apple said that at launch, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok, and Twitch will be supported on SharePlay, which is a somewhat limited grab bag of streaming options. Granted, there’s plenty of time for that list to get longer before iOS 15 officially rolls out to users in the fall. And Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay will be available to any streaming app that wants to support it, so we’re likely to see wider adoption down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z7kOl"&gt;Some of the best applications of this feature failed to make their way into Apple’s initial slide of supported services, though. Netflix is perhaps the most obvious of these simply on the basis that virtually everyone has a Netflix login, whether they’re actually paying for it or not (at least until the inevitable &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-has-begun-1846460641"&gt;password crackdown&lt;/a&gt;). But YouTube was not mentioned either, and neither company had comment to share about potential support down the line when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week. A spokesperson for Peacock, however, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay support was on its “roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7TPW8"&gt;YouTube, in particular, seems like a huge miss for Apple, especially &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;where teens are concerned&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube hosts just about every digital media format imaginable — music, movies, news, personalities, tutorials, live feeds, etc. — but most importantly, it’s free. As video callers &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2010/10/13/video-calling-and-video-chat/"&gt;tend to skew younger&lt;/a&gt; already, apps with highly shareable content like livestreams seem like the best use case for SharePlay outside of live sporting events. That’s particularly true given that for paid services, each participant in a SharePlay streaming session will need a login for the app. After all, if the tool didn’t require credentials and allowed just anyone to drop in a FaceTime stream of content from a paid service, SharePlay would be a piracy nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M0YGcs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Are users prepared to pay up just to stream a title with friends?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiHmsQ"&gt;But that’s part of what makes the practical application of SharePlay a bit of a puzzler. Streaming the game or a movie premiere could get expensive fast. If your friends are watching NFL coverage on Sling TV, you’ll need a $35 subscription to join in (assuming the content is included in one of the service’s base plans). If you wanted to watch a Premier Access release like &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, you’d need to pay the $8 monthly subscription cost &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; an additional $30 early access ticket fee. (A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay users still need to pay for access to watch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfmiOk"&gt;It’s hard to imagine that most users would pay for a service just to be able to FaceTime while they’re watching a title. Then again, based on recent media consumption trends among teens, maybe SharePlay is part of the future of how entertainment is consumed, at least for the younger subset of Apple users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWNNec"&gt;It makes sense that a company investing heavily in its services offerings would jump on the watch party trend, if not a little late, and it does feel like a natural way for Apple to not only stay relevant but also sell subscriptions and hardware — even if right now, SharePlay alone seems unlikely to balloon numbers for streaming services. Free, social-leaning services and streaming titans are most likely to see success with this feature, and livestreaming apps seem likely to perform best. But they’ll actually have to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; SharePlay for that to work. As it currently stands, many are not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor Shorts will soon let users sample audio from any YouTube video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zGM5zd"&gt;Being able to sample audio from other users’ videos is one of TikTok’s greatest strengths. It allows memes to percolate across the platform and lets users discover new content by watching videos with the same sound. Soon, YouTube will expand this feature in its TikTok competitor, Shorts, letting users sample sounds from &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; content uploaded to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLFHxU"&gt;YouTube officially announced this feature last month in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/108706620/introducing-a-new-way-to-create-shorts-with-audio-from-across-youtube?"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, but tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it should now be available for the first time in new markets as part of the launch of Shorts in the UK, Canada, and a number of Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela). The YouTube-sampling tool will then roll out to other Shorts markets including the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXmlZ"&gt;Shorts users can already sample sounds from other Shorts videos (as well as from a library of licensed music). But this update will greatly expand the audio they have easy access to. The feature will funnel YouTube users into its Shorts feature via a new “Create” button in the mobile app. This will appear underneath videos next to the like and dislike buttons. Clicking it will give users the option to sample the video’s audio in Shorts. Shorts viewers will also be able to tap the audio in any video to head back to the original source in YouTube proper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tq9HhbgKPWeDKzNTNgJzbI484aA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642212/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.51.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorts videos sampling audio from YouTube will link back to the original source. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk31t1"&gt;This feature will allow longform creators “to benefit by allowing the community to find something interesting in their video,” YouTube’s product lead for Shorts, Todd Sherman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Shorts users can create something with the sample audio, he says, and the creators of the audio will “get perhaps inbound traffic or exposure from that. From the longform creator perspective I think a lot of folks are excited to have their things remixed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtDsA"&gt;Not all creators are happy about this, though. After YouTubers noticed a new check-box in the settings for their video uploads that gives Shorts users access to their audio, many complained that this would let people “steal” their content. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youtube+shorts+permissions"&gt;Search for &lt;/a&gt;“YouTube Shorts permissions” on YouTube itself and you’ll find plenty of videos worrying about exactly this scenario, with thumbnails posing questions like: “YouTube legalized video stealing?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQuKAw"&gt;The permissions box seems to have been introduced before Shorts users were actually able to sample audio from YouTube videos. Right now it has to be unticked manually for each video, but Sherman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is working on a bulk opt-out option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wxwQAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br&gt;YouTube suddenly automatically checked "Yes" on EVERY YouTube video to allow them to be re-uploaded as Shorts on OTHER channels ???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let your YouTuber friends know that they have to go through and uncheck this setting on every video or risk stolen content... &lt;a href="https://t.co/b4rjiwmE2c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b4rjiwmE2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mysticat #Mysty200k (@MysticatLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MysticatLive/status/1388191677836414977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnPnbj"&gt;A YouTube-sampling feature could create other problems, too. A huge array of content has been uploaded to YouTube over the years, much of it sensitive or personal in nature. The uploaders of this content won’t necessarily want their videos to be sampled as this could enable harassment or abuse. Despite this, the sampling feature will be opt-out rather than opt-in. That means all YouTube videos will be sampleable by default, and creators will have to specify which videos they don’t want to be used in Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE6PRN"&gt;Sherman says YouTube is aware of these potential problems, but that the company’s discussions with creators has indicated more excitement. “There is some concern about examples of videos that you might think are personal or sensitive and that’s why creators have asked for the ability to opt out. But they also seem to recognize that it sort of doesn’t work if it’s very selectively an opt-in,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zppWbr"&gt;YouTube originally launched Shorts last September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India&lt;/a&gt; before bringing the feature to the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286286/youtube-shorts-us-rollout-product-features-updates-chapters-monetization-neal-mohan"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay $100 million to creators&lt;/a&gt; to use the app, though exactly how much individual creators can earn isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
