    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made options are the 2017 Apple TV 4K or what Apple now calls the Apple TV HD, the older model from 2015. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago. Even the Apple TV HD still costs $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPkleZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously stated that Apple’s only remaining TV hardware was the Apple TV 4K. It has been updated to reflect that Apple still sells the older Apple TV HD. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rudy Giuliani just lost his YouTube privileges for two weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rudy Giuliani Appears Before Michigan State Legislature’s House Oversight Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGYR4_NR5NhQLyjqIs2XzSAoOwc=/0x81:5077x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68895097/1229918044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wikrPL"&gt;YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It’s Giulani’s second strike within 90 days, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/youtube-suspends-rudy-giuliani-again-for-election-fraud-claims"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani’s promotion of nicotine, which is against the company’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvUyKd"&gt;“We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We removed content from the Rudy W. Giuliani channel for violating our sale of regulated goods policy, which prohibits content facilitating the use of nicotine, and our presidential election integrity policy. Additionally, in accordance with our long standing strikes system, we issued a strike against the Rudy W. Giuliani channel, which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KHFBo"&gt;In January, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/youtube-temporarily-suspends-rudy-giuliani-from-partner-program?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;suspended Giuliani for a week&lt;/a&gt; for sharing 2020 election misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; him from YouTube’s partner program, meaning he couldn’t earn ad revenue on his videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7AT5Y"&gt;If Giuliani gets a third strike in the same 90-day period following the first, his channel will be permanently removed from YouTube, according to the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;company’s strikes policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmZZIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook continue bans over Trump election claims","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s ‘supervised experiences’ help parents choose what content their kids can see</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJa41hIVcbnlTRHHbR5oRdm5YjE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867114/Supervised_Experiences.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5nPYd3"&gt;YouTube is announcing “supervised experiences,” a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the streaming video platform. According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube hopes the filters will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app. The program will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psHndH"&gt;Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account. There’s the “Explore” level, which YouTube says is “generally suitable” for kids nine and up’ “Explore More,” which is meant for kids 13 and up; and “Most of YouTube,” which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content. In the US, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409#zippy="&gt;and most other countries&lt;/a&gt;, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0p8OAQ5nQ_TrCUvkoYNedOn8XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324445/Supervised_Experiences_Content_settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parents choose a content level for their children’s account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUbXH"&gt;It isn’t clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube says the “Explore” level will have “vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more.” As the name suggests, the “Explore More” level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned “Explore” categories. The company says that “Most of YouTube” will contain “sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9lClh"&gt;For all its promise, YouTube’s supervised experiences is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it won’t be perfect, admitting that it “will make mistakes,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;we’ve seen happen with the Kids app&lt;/a&gt;. As such, parents shouldn’t think of it as a “set it and forget it” solution. They’ll still need to remain vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmQEq9"&gt;Nevertheless, the new content options should help parents with children who feel too confined by the Kids app (which YouTube still recommends for younger kids) but are too impressionable to be exposed to the full YouTube experience. YouTube can be a dangerous place full of misinformation and conspiracy, so it’s good to see Google giving parents tools to help ease their children into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t reopen remaining creator Spaces as company shifts to new model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-4dj5uugSAfiiYN35MaIzVUUyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841243/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UdtHq4"&gt;YouTube’s permanent Spaces locations, which were designed to offer resources and networking opportunities to its creators, won’t reopen after the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtubespaces-update/"&gt;the company has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, YouTube says it’s shifting to a hybrid model that will combine pop-up locations with virtual events. The Spaces that won’t be re-opening are in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rio, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIzQ1a"&gt;Although it was the pandemic that pushed YouTube towards a virtual model, the shift away from permanent Spaces has been underway for at least a couple of years. Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/30/youtube-pivots-physical-spaces-strategy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company was moving towards a reliance on temporary pop-up locations to give it the flexibility to serve creators across a wider area. At the time it said it would shutter its permanent Spaces in Mumbai and Toronto, and serve the locations with pop-ups instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KQ0IQ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We truly believe this flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqBZDv"&gt;YouTube’s mix of virtual events and pop-up locations have already reached tens of thousands of creators, according to the company. It says that last year it ran over a thousand virtual events that were attended by over 70,000 people across 145 countries. Meanwhile, since 2016, its 45 pop-up events have reached over 15,000 creators across more than 20 cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfPIw5"&gt;“We truly believe this flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions,” YouTube says in a blog post. In 2021, the company says it’s running a multi-week virtual program as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;#YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing to invest in its NextUp program for emerging creators. There will also be live and recorded online workshops. Pop-up events and experiences will return once it’s safe to run in-person events again, YouTube says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube removes PewDiePie diss track for violating cyberbullying, child safety rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o21x9hSOp_3rafYImCkJdAiZEPQ=/181x0:1309x752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840577/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_10.09.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p35bjg"&gt;YouTube has removed one of Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg’s recent videos, a diss track aimed at popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;children’s channel Cocomelon&lt;/a&gt;, for violating guidelines around cyberbullying and child safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v5GbZ"&gt;In the video, Kjellberg attacks Cocomelon’s content and pokes fun at kids who watch the videos. Kjellberg also uses phrases like “your audience is just a bunch of motherfucking virgins,” which could violate YouTube’s guidelines for using offensive or vulgar language in videos that include children. Toward the end of the video, Kjellberg also hands what appears to be plastic weapons to a few kids, who use them to attack a melon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDCydO"&gt;YouTube’s team decided to remove the video because it contained imagery that was inappropriate for children despite “looking like it was made for kids” and for creating content that “harms the YouTube community by persistently inciting hostility between creators for financial gain,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1362572883793309698/photo/1"&gt;according to official tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The second rule is in line with YouTube’s policy focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21005185/youtube-harassment-policy-update-malicious-expression-public-figures-maza-crowder"&gt;preventing creator-on-creator harassmen&lt;/a&gt;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwUnVE"&gt;The company’s statement also acknowledges that while criticism is allowed, and diss tracks are allowed in certain cases, “this video crossed the line.” The removal did not result in a channel strike for Kjellberg’s channel, but further violations of YouTube’s policies may result in a channel strike, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vquyJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am not going to continue with it because 1) it wouldn’t be funny and 2) I don’t actually care about Cocomelon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQOZi8"&gt;“Our policies prohibit content that leads to repeated patterns of harassment on- and off-platform,” a YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “Following a review, we’ve removed the video in question for violating those policies because they had the effect of encouraging abusive fan behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pw8Ph"&gt;Re-uploads are circulating on YouTube, but the company stated on Twitter that it will be removing them as moderators come across videos. YouTube’s policies around kids content have tightened over the last few years, and content that may target kids or families by including children in the video are prohibited from using sexual themes, violence, obscene, or other mature themes, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rRlf7"&gt;Part of the reason that Cocomelon caught Kjellberg’s attention was because of the channel’s remarkable growth. In June 2020, it was brought to Kjellberg’s attention that Cocomelon was rapidly gaining subscribers. By mid-December, Cocomelon had surpassed 100 million subscribers. In a February 8th video, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8h4XU67bNU"&gt;Kjellberg announced&lt;/a&gt; he was creating a diss track aimed at Cocomelon. He released it a week later, where it remained active for a few days before YouTube took it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMq8CJ"&gt;“I saw this as the finale,” Kjellberg said in a video posted on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWPWrz7pIz4"&gt;February 17th called “I Love Kids.”&lt;/a&gt; “I am not going to continue with it because 1) it wouldn’t be funny and 2) I don’t actually care about Cocomelon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnU6p"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Kjellberg has created a diss track, either. In 2018, Kjellberg released “Bitch Lasagna” during an ongoing feud with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/30/17800234/pewdiepie-top-youtube-channel-t-series-india"&gt;Indian Bollywood studio T-Series&lt;/a&gt;. Their feud began when Kjellberg’s fans noticed that T-Series was on track to overtake Kjellberg as the most subscribed to channel on YouTube. Kjellberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18521547/pewdiepie-subscribe-new-zealand-shooting-hateful-tseries-meme"&gt;disavowed the “subscribe to PewDiePie” meme &lt;/a&gt;after the phrase was used by the gunman who murdered more than 50 people in the Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX14a7"&gt;By the end of March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million"&gt;T-Series overtook Kjellberg&lt;/a&gt; as the most subscribed-to channel on YouTube, which he acknowledged with a new music video. Currently, there are livestreams on YouTube tracking Cocomelon and Kjellberg’s subscribers. Even if Kjellberg is done with the meme, it’s clear the internet is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on3gnX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmRNlX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFKXxY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqb97J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKr6rT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV offering HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 less in new entertainment bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NgodQrn6eVgT9Pnf24FZ3UgCD1w=/0x2:918x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838074/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_12.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCV1BW"&gt;For YouTube TV customers who subscribe individually to HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz, the company is rolling out a new entertainment bundle that will save people $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XR290i"&gt;The optional package is $30 a month. Individually, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeYoutubeTVOfferingEntertainmentBundleHBOMaxStarzShowtime02182021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; costs $15 a month, Showtime is $11 a month, and Starz is $9 a month, meaning customers who subscribe to all three spend $35 a month through the individual subscription plans. YouTube TV has steadily added more premium channels over the last couple of years, including inking a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145651/youtube-tv-hbo-streaming-max-cinemax-carriage-deal"&gt;deal with WarnerMedia for HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx2id6"&gt;While the bundle is an easy way to save $5 a month, YouTube has also gotten increasingly expensive over the last year. In June, YouTube TV increased its monthly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;price from $50 to $65&lt;/a&gt;. The move came after YouTube signed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249931/viacomcbs-youtubetv-nickelodeon-mtv-comedy-central-streaming"&gt;distribution agreement with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt; to carry a suite of channels: BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land, and VH1. While YouTube TV isn’t the only virtual TV provider to increase monthly fees as more distribution deals are struck. (AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, Fubo TV, and Hulu with Live TV have all faced similar price hikes.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRwMpa"&gt;Still, for someone who relies on YouTube TV and wants access to three of the biggest premium cable networks, it’s nice to save $5 a month. Now if only YouTube TV could figure out its regional sports network issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is adding offline downloads and 4K streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUF6Z24ux9IWeD5uXSDuh8SuNT4=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829749/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7n1Je"&gt;If the monthly price for all of these streaming TV services is going to keep going up, the least they can do is throw in some new features and better video quality, right? That’s what YouTube says you can soon expect from YouTube TV; today, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that in the coming weeks, the service will “introduce a new add-on package with 4K streaming, offline viewing, and unlimited concurrent streams at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntVz5p"&gt;Unfortunately, a YouTube TV spokesperson didn’t have much else to share beyond the top-level news of these upcoming additions. It’s not clear whether there will be any limits on what channels or shows support offline downloads, nor is YouTube giving any examples of what content will be available in 4K. One would hope for some sporting events. Currently, customers have a maximum of three concurrent streams, but it seems like YouTube will be removing any such constraints so long as you’re viewing from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU1cfZ"&gt;Offline viewing is pretty rare among the streaming TV apps. Hulu lets you download on-demand TV shows and movies to watch offline, but this doesn’t apply to recordings from its live TV service. Sling TV offers no such functionality, nor does AT&amp;amp;T TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP6UyS"&gt;The “add-on package” language suggests you’ll have to pay more than the standard $65 monthly subscription to access these features. YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;raised its base subscription&lt;/a&gt; to that last June. But the company still advertises that, even as the cost increases, YouTube TV still doesn’t come with any hidden fees and offers unlimited cloud DVR space. The service has over 3 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts beta will launch in the United States in March </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9R6RIx-FXSd3HiCpZRUxJZNoiAg=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829754/shorts_youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7CncZ"&gt;YouTube is gearing up to launch a beta version of its TikTok competitor, Shorts, in the United States beginning in March, chief product officer Neal Mohan announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k379Nl"&gt;In a blog post announcing a number of features coming to YouTube in the coming months, Mohan said the YouTube team will be giving more creators access to Shorts in the United States. The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India, where the feature has existed for several months, according to Mohan. Since December, “the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled, and the YouTube Shorts player is now receiving more than 3.5 billion daily views globally,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLEDA"&gt;Reports that YouTube was working on a TikTok competitor first emerged in April 2020, but YouTube didn’t roll out Shorts in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;until September&lt;/a&gt;. While the company was trying to figure out how to extend its creator base and 2 billion monthly users to a mobile-first product in wake of TikTok’s explosive popularity, Instagram was doing the same thing. Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;launched Reels not long&lt;/a&gt; before YouTube rolled out Shorts, leading two of the world’s biggest tech and social platforms racing to catch up to ByteDance’s app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlrmjW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMjKEk"&gt;It’s no surprise that YouTube is trying to get Shorts into the hands of creators and users as quickly as possible. By November 2020, TikTok was seeing continuous spikes in growth, tripling the user base it had in 2018. Like other companies, TikTok’s business was helped by the pandemic, giving people stuck at home the ability to engage with a never-ending stream of new, short videos and make their own. TikTok is forecasted to cross the 1 billion monthly active user line &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/new-forecast-pegs-tiktok-to-top-1-2b-monthly-active-users-in-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHsY_7JfSNeqIDSlT2zjt_7imPDGSz5SVvIOvju6TxFRswkjZQGUQURJ7v9Ouiy89l7eG-p4ZMN_0G_m5ydXDQCp4ibK8Y2kTqAvnyPGi1BWAG4CVRjnYV96zC8Ypsr5VPMEYzi1nN9XMMOUns7dd4HkG80cP5gvhQwV8s9i42jO"&gt;this year, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro1eL5"&gt;All of this helps to explain why YouTube is finding new ways to give creators features that will keep them making videos for the platform (instead of pivoting entirely to TikTok or Reels). Mohan’s blog also announced new monetization features, including applause, which will allow &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365"&gt;fans to buy a one-time clapping animation&lt;/a&gt; that appears on top of the video. Creators are given a certain percentage of the revenue from each applause purchased. Similar tools like this already exist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14249630/youtube-super-chat-pay-pin-comments-live-stream"&gt;including Super Chat&lt;/a&gt;. Mohan didn’t say when the feature will become available to creators, only that people should be able to “unlock” it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcihDU"&gt;On top of that, YouTube is beta testing a “new integrated shopping experience” that will roll out later this year. The idea is that people can purchase items from channels whose opinions they trust. Creators can tag products in their videos allowing viewers to purchase them if they’d like, according to a YouTube spokesperson. As long as the product is within YouTube’s catalog, creators can tag them and viewers can purchase those products. Currently, those products are limited to beauty and electronic categories. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has asked YouTube for more information about the breakdown of revenue for creators if a product is bought from their channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dYHX9i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6_t26Q9aVM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIcKKJ"&gt;In an effort to give people more control over parts of YouTube and how they watch videos, the company is rolling out a couple of product features that will directly impact what and how they watch. On the YouTube Kids app, the product team will offer new parental tools that will allow parents to add specific videos and channels from the main app, according to the blog. This will allow children to watch videos that parents think are acceptable but may not appear in the YouTube Kids app because of restrictions in place — think certain types of gaming videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntpLGh"&gt;Finally, YouTube’s team is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238551/youtube-chapters-experiment-music-game-soundtracks-timestamp-video"&gt;expanding its “chapters” feature&lt;/a&gt;, which adds specific timestamps to videos. They’ll soon be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518034/google-search-ai-machine-learning-spelling-video-chapters-better-results"&gt;automatically added&lt;/a&gt; to relevant videos that may require chapters (like lo-fi chillhop channels). More detailed information about all of the changes can be read in Mohan’s blog, alongside the videos that YouTube’s product team will release throughout the year detailing what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYK8Q3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube ends support for old 2012 Apple TV, but you can still use AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CYs8_m4v-W895j4klNtUj3zRFh8=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767426/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Apple TV was first released in 2012. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EILhF7"&gt;Starting next month, YouTube will no longer be natively available to stream on the third-generation Apple TV, first released in 2012. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that a message is being displayed to users warning them of the upcoming change. The fourth-gen Apple TV HD  and fifth-gen Apple TV 4K, the two streaming boxes Apple currently sells, are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBrOF4"&gt;Here’s the full message being shown to users (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XD67VZ"&gt;Starting early March, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Apple TV (3rd generation). You can still watch YouTube on Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, iPhone, or iPad. With AirPlay, you can also stream YouTube from your iOS device directly to any Apple TV (3rd generation or later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf39WS"&gt;While it will soon no longer be possible to natively run YouTube on the third-generation Apple TV itself, owners will still be able to stream the service from an iPhone or iPad using AirPlay. We’ve got a guide on how to do so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21248047/airplay-apple-tv-how-to-stream-iphone-macbook-watch-video"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh9Ikh"&gt;Other streaming services have also gradually been dropping support for older Apple TV models. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/17/hbo-now-app-removed-from-2nd-and-3rd-gen-apple-tv-as-hbo-ends-support/"&gt;HBO pulled its HBO Now app&lt;/a&gt; from second- and third-generation Apple TV boxes, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216451/hbo-go-max-apple-tv-third-gen-support-extended-april"&gt;initially delaying the move&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic. These apps won’t be the last, either. While its newer devices run tvOS and feature a built-in App Store, the built-in apps on Apple’s old TV boxes relied on streaming services working directly with Apple to offer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s44vlE"&gt;If you own an old Apple TV and simply can’t live without the YouTube app, then it might be time to replace your streaming device. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;current top picks&lt;/a&gt; for the job are the Roku Streaming Stick Plus and Roku Premiere, which are both more affordable than Apple’s current lineup of streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing clips on live streams and VODs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3XqbaSQbtRVshlRyA2KsN3hgY4=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735325/youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVCqa1"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/95526465"&gt;is introducing clipping&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to make short clips of live streams or videos — starting today with a small group of creators. Those clips can be anywhere between five and 60 seconds in length and will have a new URL associated with them. Creators and viewers will be able to create clips by clicking on the clip icon, though the feature is currently limited to desktop and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LNE4"&gt;It’s a smart move from YouTube, because clipping is something of a live-streaming industry standard. You can more easily share live video content via a short video clip that can be passed around social media, rather than requiring viewers to skim through a potentially hourslong stream. Every platform from Twitch to the dearly departed site Mixer has decided that it’s something their creators need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6PrDZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we are launching an experimental version of Clips on YouTube. Check out videos on the Creator Insider channel and test it out yourself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clips are 5-60 sec, shareable, segments of content (Live/VOD) that live on top of the original video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj"&gt;https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DVWNQ2BoEx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DVWNQ2BoEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lester (@Chen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chen/status/1354837070460555264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94ajXm"&gt;YouTube adding the feature is just another signal that the online video titan intends to beef up its live-streaming operation. As is the conventional wisdom in streamer spaces, clips help channels grow. A good clip that goes viral can bring in a huge influx of new viewers — and in streaming, where visibility is a big part of creating a sustainable income, that’s half the battle. &lt;/p&gt;
