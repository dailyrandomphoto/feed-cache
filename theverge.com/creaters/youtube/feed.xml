    <title>YouTube will now remove videos disputing Joe Biden’s election victory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsmU55"&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it will begin removing any content alleging widespread voter fraud influenced the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvfnVL"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the November 3rd election, YouTube came under fire for allowing channels to publish videos making false claims about election results. In one instance, One America News Network, a verified YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; declaring that “Trump won” the election. At the time, YouTube defended its decision to let the video stand, saying in a statement, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5dbuP"&gt;The company went on to say that content from “authoritative news organizations” were “the most popular videos about the election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXqZYU"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;Wednesday blog&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube said that its decision to begin removing misleading election videos follows the US’s safe harbor deadline and that “enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect.” Starting Wednesday, YouTube will begin removing any new content that misleads viewers about the outcome of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTLMS"&gt;YouTube’s announcement follows a series of lawsuits placed by the Donald Trump campaign challenging the results of the election. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected a request to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/supreme-court-republican-challenge-pennsylvania-vote.html"&gt;block certification&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania’s election results, making it nearly impossible for Republicans to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4kkjm"&gt;In the post, YouTube said its election information panels had surfaced over 200,000 election-related videos and were shown over 4.5 billion times. The company said that it would &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;update these panels&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, linking to electoral college results provided by the Office of the Federal Register calling Biden the official president-elect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFyrSR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Gaming had its best year ever with more than 100 billion hours watched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl3EDdFNhXfvrLLblVrC95tKGn4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479751/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3zNK1d"&gt;Gaming remains one of the most dominant pillars of online entertainment, and nowhere is that more apparent than in YouTube’s 2020 statistics. According to YouTube Gaming head Ryan Wyatt, users of the video-sharing site watched 100 billion hours of gaming content on the platform this past year, double the number of hours watched in 2018. The company also &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-gaming-2020/"&gt;published a blog post on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; with a more in-depth rundown of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ww2km5"&gt;Of that 100 billion figure, 10 billion of those hours were of YouTube Gaming live streams, a strong sign the Google-owned site is shaping up to be an even more formidable competitor to Amazon-owned Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pnuXOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You all watched an impressive 100 billion hours of Gaming video content on the platform, with over 10B of those hours coming from live gaming streams. If you remember, that's DOUBLED what we did in 2018 (50B+). Yes, Gaming on YouTube has doubled in size in just 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Wyatt (@Fwiz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fwiz/status/1336303257421901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAcELl"&gt;Wyatt had some other interesting stats to share. For instance, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was the most-watched game on all of YouTube by a large margin, with more than 200 billion views of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;live streams and uploaded video watched this year. Naturally, the next most-watched game on the platform was &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;with 75 billion views, and the top five are rounded out by mobile battle royale &lt;em&gt;Garena Free Fire &lt;/em&gt;(72 billion), &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; (70 billion), and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;(67 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5xUfB"&gt;YouTube says it now has more than 40 million active gaming channels, and that 80,000 channels hit 100,000 subscribers this past year. More than 1,000 channels broke 5 million subscribers in 2020, while more than 350 channels hit 10 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CtzFJ"&gt;“Creators across the board have seen massive increases in subscribers, audiences and viewership throughout 2020. One incredible example of growth in 2020 is &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; content creator Dream, who saw channel subscriptions surge from 1 million in January 2020 to over 13 million by October the same year,” reads YouTube’s blog post. “The channel’s speedrunning series drew in tens of millions of views each.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyFm7g"&gt;Part of the reason why gaming content has likely surged in 2020 is the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has sent online entertainment stats through the roof for activities like streaming TV and multiplayer gaming. We don’t yet have stats for Facebook Gaming or Twitch, but it would not be surprising for both those competitors to report record numbers before the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPML5E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the most-watched games on YouTube were measured in hours viewed. That is incorrect; YouTube measures them by total number of views. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube live streams now support HDR  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2L2DRm6rO5nip8gwmTMxU7oT5g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478580/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="myY5Sq"&gt;Starting today, YouTube creators can live-stream their videos in high dynamic range (HDR), the company has announced. The platform has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13547710/google-youtube-hdr-video-support"&gt;HDR in prerecorded content&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, but now, live content can also benefit from the technology. YouTube claims it’s “the first major platform to support live HDR.” At launch it supports the HDR10 and HLG standards, and YouTube says it hopes to expand this offering in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSu8Bs"&gt;HDR is a technology that lets videos show a wider range of colors and brightness. Blacks can be darker and whites can be brighter, revealing more detail in the shadows and highlights of an image, respectively. The result is that images appear much more punchy and vibrant leading &lt;a href="https://hdtvtest.co.uk/n/Experts-Say-HDR-Is-More-Important-Than-4K-and-8K-Resolution"&gt;some to argue&lt;/a&gt; that the jump from SDR (standard dynamic range) to HDR offers a bigger benefit than the jump from 1080p to 4K. YouTube added support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13783272/youtube-update-4k-live-streaming-support-360-video"&gt;4K live-streaming back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6yoct"&gt;In order to benefit from the new technology, creators will need to use one of the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported encoders&lt;/a&gt; Google lists, and viewers will need to be watching on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported playback device&lt;/a&gt; like the YouTube app on HDR TVs, a Chromecast Ultra, or an Android device with an HDR display. YouTube says it plans to add support for more encoders and mobile devices to stream HDR content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieTUQd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 8th, 12:49PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation that the HDR formats supported are HDR10 and HLG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christchurch shooter was radicalized on YouTube, New Zealand report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VDZz_pY2acvsuGzBVaTuNZay8Pg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476358/VRG_ILLO_3808_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Corey Brickley for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLAjaz"&gt;The Australian white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was radicalized by YouTube, according to &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/"&gt;a 792-page report&lt;/a&gt; on the March 2019 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmwIax"&gt;“What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist made that he was ‘not a frequent commentator on extreme right-wing sites and YouTube was a significant source of information and inspiration’,” said Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live?page=with:block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296#block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gEWAm"&gt;This is not the first time YouTube has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;linked to radicalization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbzzzx/youtube-decides-to-leave-neo-nazi-propaganda-online"&gt;white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;. There has been an ongoing argument about whether YouTube’s algorithm pushes people &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html"&gt;toward more extreme views&lt;/a&gt; over time. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/critics-slam-youtube-study-showing-no-ties-to-radicalization.html"&gt;Although this is not a universal conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;some researchers say&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17876892/youtube-extremism-report-rebecca-lewis-data-society"&gt;a business model that rewards edgy content&lt;/a&gt; and a personalized algorithm meant to keep viewers hooked is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;recipe for radicalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBeBpv"&gt;YouTube has made “significant progress” in curtailing hate speech since the 2019 Christchurch attack, says Alex Joseph, a YouTube spokesperson. YouTube strengthened its hate speech policy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307303/youtube-bans-molyneux-duke-richard-spencer-conduct-hate-speech"&gt;terminated the channels mentioned in the report&lt;/a&gt;, and has altered its recommendations system to limit the spread of “borderline content.” “We will continue our work together with the Prime Minister, as well as governments, industry partners, and communities around the world to combat the spread of violent extremism online,” Joseph said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHQLs"&gt;The report’s mentions of YouTube are part of a larger inquiry into the hate crime to see if it could have been prevented. The shooter &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/part-6-what-public-sector-agencies-knew-about-the-terrorist/evaluation-of-what-public-sector-agencies-did-with-the-information-they-had-about-the-individual/"&gt;sent an email&lt;/a&gt; to Parliament, the Prime Minister’s office, and news outlets eight minutes before he began his attack, according to the report. His manifesto was attached to the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT1RwS"&gt;The authorities weren’t the only ones the shooter alerted. His manifesto was also posted to 8chan, &lt;a href="https://splinternews.com/meet-the-man-keeping-8chan-the-worlds-most-vile-websit-1793856249"&gt;a message board that often hosts far-right content&lt;/a&gt;; included in the post was a link to a Facebook page, where the poster said a livestream of the attack would be broadcast. (Facebook later removed the page and video.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w17pnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shooter also modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uipKCb"&gt;A 17-minute video that appeared to show the shooting was uploaded to Facebook YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;The video and the manifesto were mirrored worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and re-uploaded to platforms repeatedly over the following days, often faster than platforms could take them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keau0x"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/firearms-licensing/general-life-in-new-zealand/"&gt;goes on to say&lt;/a&gt; that though the shooter frequented far-right message boards on 4chan and 8chan, the evidence shows a more substantial use of YouTube. The shooter also  modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h83SCS"&gt;The shooter also used his Facebook account to discuss Adolph Hitler’s &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf, &lt;/em&gt;particularly the parts about propaganda that could draw in new extremists, in a group called The Lads Society Season Two. He often posted Islamophobic rhetoric in the group, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu009n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds YouTube statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will let all users livestream games directly to YouTube tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0zhwxV8Jt91kcL208LFAOYm6Qg=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68475868/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvALho"&gt;From the very beginning, Google Stadia and YouTube were supposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274184/google-stadia-youtube-streaming-future-gaming-cloud"&gt;to work together&lt;/a&gt; — thanks to the magic of cloud computing, you’d be able to click a YouTube ad to instantly begin playing a game, YouTubers would be able to invite their viewers to instantly join their game, and — perhaps most importantly — creators would be able to instantly, effortlessly be able to livestream their Stadia games to YouTube just by pressing a button on the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvmnJ"&gt;None of those things happened at Stadia’s launch last November, but the biggest one is apparently arriving tomorrow: every Stadia user will be able to livestream directly to YouTube starting tomorrow, a representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX6kPM"&gt;This afternoon, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/07/stadia-youtube-streaming-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature appeared to be rolling out, and we spotted the ability to link a YouTube account in our Stadia accounts as well — though not the ability to actually stream yet. I guess we’ll try that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyI6QqpcHzBw5rNHI0j_QeHPpEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153571/stream_to_youtube_stadia.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu9VPy"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll still have to give your stream a title and tweak a few settings, like whether your stream is appropriate for kids (to comply with children’s protection rules). It’s also not clear whether you’ll be able to stream in 4K quite yet, as Stadia originally promised. You’d also likely need a $9.99 a month Stadia Pro subscription for that, like you do for 4K gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uJJSt"&gt;The feature couldn’t come at a more important time for Stadia: the service’s most important game yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is arriving this week, at a time when next-gen consoles and the latest graphics cards to build your own powerful PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are incredibly difficult and expensive to buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;biggest test for Stadia yet&lt;/a&gt;, and one the company is banking on: buying &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;on the service comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;a full set of free Stadia hardware for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; — not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;the set it gave free to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpFaHl"&gt;People streaming &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from Stadia to YouTube could be the single biggest opportunity yet for Google to prove what its service can do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Floyd Mayweather is fighting Logan Paul in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WriFZ7F05tFYEpCNYIYpt_lTHqA=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68468465/paulmayweather.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6HY5q"&gt;YouTuber Logan Paul has struck a deal to fight former boxing megastar Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a “special exhibition” match on February 20th. The bout will be streamed as a &lt;a href="https://fanmio.com/products/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-special-exhibition-fight"&gt;pay-per-view on Fanmio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljDODc"&gt;Mayweather is an undefeated champion with a 50-0 record, multiple world titles in five weight classes, and an Olympic bronze medal. Paul is best known for his controversial YouTube video where he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16875188/logan-paul-aokigahara-suicide-forest-japan"&gt;filmed a dead body in a Japanese forest&lt;/a&gt;. He has fought in one sanctioned boxing match: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785762/logan-paul-ksi-fight-winner-result-youtube"&gt;a loss to fellow YouTuber KSI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PlkG7"&gt;Needless to say, this is unlikely to be a festival of evenly matched athletic prowess. But Mayweather is not above signing up to farcical contests for the spectacle and the payday. His 50th official win involved him coming out of retirement in 2017 to face UFC star Conor McGregor, who had never professionally boxed before. The following year he fought kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in a widely panned exhibition match, winning by TKO in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eFPcV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We talked to Jake Paul, who is currently going Super Saiyan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SAMpSQ"&gt;Mayweather called out Logan Paul last month &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FloydMayweather/status/1329295858521706497"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, making his thoughts on boxing YouTubers clear and saying he’s “not the one for the kid games.” Paul’s brother, Jake, responded to Mayweather’s comments ahead of his own fight against former NBA player Nate Robinson, which he ended up winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAijp"&gt;“You know, it doesn’t bother me,” Jake &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day, he’s like 5-foot-4, so he’s actually the little kid here, and obviously he just wants attention. He’s fifty-something years old. He should be in retirement. So he just wants to get relevancy by talking about the YouTube kids, because we’re the ones popping off right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0BDQg"&gt;(Mayweather is actually 5-foot-8 and 43 years old. Also very good at boxing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa42Qr"&gt;The whole situation is deeply silly, which is no doubt why organizers expect a lot of people to tune in. The “early pricing” of $24.99 only applies to the first million PPV sales, with the price rising to $39.99, then $59.99 on December 29th, then $69.99 from February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube hit Ryan’s World comes to Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o-TIL6yT9KuOTY16yT3Q598gZE=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455644/RW_Roblox_Characters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9xEIc"&gt;Ryan’s World is expanding to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. The hit YouTube channel is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F4882738396%2FRyans-World-Launch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F4%2F22152447%2Fryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching its own virtual world&lt;/a&gt; inside the popular kids game, which allows players to create their own spaces and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrjFWS"&gt;Players will be able to drop into a sprawling digital world inspired by the YouTube show and explore a racecourse, a fire station, a beach, and a school, among other locations. There’s also a Rainbow Road-esque path into space and a strange box labeled “MYSTERY PETS.” The game world is supposed to launch on December 5th at 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAv8F8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been around for more than a decade, but the game’s popularity has soared since the beginning of the pandemic. It now has 31.1 million daily users, up 82 percent year over year, and the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;filed to go public&lt;/a&gt;. As it’s grown, more and more mainstream names have carved out a space inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to meet its huge audience. Lil Nas X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557275/lil-nas-x-roblox-virtual-performance-announced-holiday-old-town-road"&gt;performed a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; there in November, and the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594054/ready-player-two-roblox-treasure-hunt-ernest-cline"&gt;hosted a treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; to tie in with the release of &lt;em&gt;Ready Player Two &lt;/em&gt;earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKoq3BjCUamLCvz6ASW7R5ycuhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22144602/RTR_MKT_RobloxStil_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AyknTu"&gt;Ryan’s World has likewise been growing. The YouTube channel, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;started with toy unboxing videos&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, has grown into a multimedia kids empire. The channel’s star, Ryan Kaji, has a TV show on Nick Jr., a racing video game available on major consoles, and a toy and clothing line sold at major retailers. The channel just made plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;a new show on Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPGX7a"&gt;Kaji has been regularly playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; on one of his YouTube channels for more than two years, so offering a Ryan’s World level that viewers can later visit seems like a natural expansion. Though &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is free to play, it also offers creators a way to make money by selling items inside their game worlds. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/9-year-old-youtube-star-ryan-kaji-opens-virtual-world-on-roblox-11607079600"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Ryan’s World location will sell gems that can be exchanged for virtual goods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will ask commenters to rethink posting if their message seems offensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JKI8adtg2Ztzwsbgcg8jXS37J4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449820/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBFLa3"&gt;YouTube is trying to combat offensive comments that appear under videos by following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286855/twitter-articles-prompt-unread-feature-conversations"&gt;other social media companies&lt;/a&gt; and asking people before they post something that may be offensive: “Is this something you really want to share?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s15mkm"&gt;The company is launching a new product feature that will warn people when they’re going to post a comment that it “may be offensive to others,” in order to give them “the option to reflect before posting,” according to a new blog post. The tool won’t actually stop people from posting said comment. Prompts won’t appear before every comment, but it will for ones that YouTube’s system deems offensive, which is based on content that’s been repeatedly reported. Once the prompt does appear, people can post the comment as they originally intended or use additional time to edit the comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeEwr"&gt;For creators, the company is also rolling out better content filtering systems in YouTube Studio (the backend where creators manage their channel). The new filter will seek out inappropriate or hurtful comments that were automatically flagged and held for review, and remove them from the queue so people don’t have to read them. The new feature will roll out on Android first and in English before appearing elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPSdLv"&gt;There’s no question that YouTube has a problem with hurtful comments on the site, but one of the bigger issues is hateful comments. Through automatic filtering, the company has removed over 46 times more daily hate speech comments since early 2019 than ever before, according to YouTube. Then there’s videos. YouTube claims that of the 1.8 million channels terminated last quarter, more than 54,000 were due to hate speech. Those were the most bans for hate speech content in a single quarter that YouTube has seen, and three times as high than in early 2019 when new hate speech policies went into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBwRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hateful speech and hurtful comments are just some of the problems that greatly affect the creator community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVck9F"&gt;YouTube is also trying to combat other issues affecting creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449717/youtube-age-restriction-machine-learning-rollout-kids-content-monetization-creators"&gt;monetization&lt;/a&gt;, bias, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17879652/youtube-creator-youtuber-burnout-problem"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, and channel growth concerns. To better understand how different communities are impacted, the company will start to ask YouTubers to voluntarily supply information about their gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity beginning in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks4zXc"&gt;The goal is to use the data to pinpoint how different communities are treated both in terms of discovery on the platform and when it comes to monetization. The LGBTQ creator community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21278050/youtube-lawsuit-lgbtq-google-doj-section-230-trump-executive-order"&gt;has consistently said&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube’s systems automatically demonetize their content or hide their videos, and they have publicly fought against the treatment they receive. YouTube’s teams also want to use the data to find “possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsVu1T"&gt;One of the biggest questions is how that data will be used and stored once it’s collected. YouTube’s blog post states that the survey will outline how the information will be applied to the company’s research and what control creators retain over their data. The blog post as it stands does not specify that now. Instead, the company states that information will not be used for advertising purposes. People will also retain the ability to opt out and delete their information whenever they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aa6jQV"&gt;“If we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities, we’re committed to working to fix them,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7xTav"&gt;There’s no current timeline for when the surveys will roll out, but more information about the project will be released in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube expands its Premieres feature with trailers and live redirects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQTbnooQ0rE3Xlp6qpSa1m2GFxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68378905/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6tdQkA"&gt;YouTube is building on its Premieres feature — used for live-streaming pre-recorded videos — by adding support for trailers, redirects from live pre-shows, and customized countdown timers. The company says there’s been an 85 percent growth in the daily use of the feature from over 8 million channels, and these additions might make Premieres useful in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubReQK"&gt;Premieres was designed to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490456/youtube-pre-recorded-videos-livestream-vidcon-2018"&gt;some of the benefits of YouTube live streams&lt;/a&gt; like live chat, but with the control of a pre-recorded and edited video. Creators typically use it to watch and respond to their subscribers while new videos debut. But as the pandemic has pushed film festivals and conventions online, Premieres’ use cases have grown. These new changes attempt to build on that momentum as online events become the norm by catering to some of the structure and marketing of traditional live events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MKQY6jpgUYBT3lBm6nmGr9nc04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137126/YTblog_BTSRedCarpet_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s simulated example of a live redirect from a BTS pre-show to a music video premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z0AGmC"&gt;The first of the new features is Live Redirect, which allows a creator with a premiere to hold a live stream prior to the video going live and automatically redirect viewers to it once it starts. YouTube imagines this filling the role of a pre-show or red carpet so viewers can learn and get excited about an upcoming video immediately before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIco6cU1ck0oXELaP7UqNSqXQ8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137138/YTblog_SetReminder_ClashRoyale_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a trailer advertising a premiere on its watch page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3mpOzS"&gt;The new optional Trailers are designed to fill in another pre-Premieres space, this time by looping a 15-second to three-minute video on an upcoming premiere’s watch page. Trailers could be used to advertise an upcoming premiere and entice potential viewers to set a reminder to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esSVKL7PDsawMfFPXinDvXpTAiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137140/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of countdown timer themes that creators will be able to choose from to lead into their premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wC7D51"&gt;The final new addition is the ability to customize the countdown timer that plays before a premiere with a Countdown Theme. YouTube says creators will be able to choose from a variety of “themes, vibes, and moods” so that the timer better matches the content of the video, rather than YouTube’s default style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oodeCd"&gt;YouTube says Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators today, with Countdown Themes available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galactus event was Fortnite’s biggest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSZCjWQ04D7svm6bi0OxP_35zbo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68247701/Fortnite_20201201161314.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7whbvu"&gt;The season-ending live event that just took place in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was the game’s biggest to date, Epic Games has confirmed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;The Galactus event&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current Marvel-themed season, had a record 15.3 million concurrent players, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1333954587879821314"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPGpzH"&gt;That beats out the Travis Scott concert from April, which peaked at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;12.3 million concurrents during the first showing&lt;/a&gt;. The record before that was the Marshmello show, which reached 10.7 million. Epic says that 3.4 million people also watched the Galactus event on Twitch and YouTube. The event saw players teaming up to stop the Marvel supervillain from destroying &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island by piloting an explosives-laden battle bus to feed him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="atwHpA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s Galactus event was a giant arcade shooter — and now the game is down","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JlJxIr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently shut down as Epic prepares to launch season 5. Anyone booting the game right now will see a timer counting down until the next season — it’s currently set at just under six hours to go. &lt;/p&gt;
