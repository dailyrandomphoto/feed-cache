    <title>How Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube are handling live streams of the Capitol mob attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udDCN2"&gt;A mob of President Donald Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the US Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, and the event was livestreamed. On YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and more, you could get a view of protestors gathered outside of — and eventually inside of — the US Capitol. In some cases, the streams were monetized through tipping features. In others, streamers encouraged viewers to donate to accounts on Patreon or GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHONTI"&gt;The event presented a sudden and serious moderation challenge for YouTube and other platforms, particularly ones that allowed live streams. YouTube, Facebook, and other social media networks prepared for the 2020 elections in November by setting up policies around labeling and banning misinformation and calls for violence. As protests started this afternoon in Washington DC, however, the platforms were once again asked to assess whether comments on and coverage of the protests were violating their policies in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRpI8s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8fG8M"&gt;On YouTube, livestreams of the mob illegally occupying the Capitol could be found by searching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF2OTDQHxu0"&gt;“Stop the Steal”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EZow4d1Ys"&gt;“Patriot Capitol’’&lt;/a&gt;. While the platform surfaced authoritative feeds from various news sources, including ABC and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, it wasn’t difficult to find pro-coup channels that were carrying feeds from a variety of other platforms, including Facebook and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNkfV0"&gt;Within those more radical YouTube feeds, chat rooms reacted live to what they were seeing. Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA.” Others expressed bewilderment over the images playing out in the Capitol, as people climbed walls, pushed their way through the police presence, and tried to break down doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSRt5O"&gt;Some streams asked for donations — which were made outside of YouTube, on platforms like PayPal. Monetization features like super chat and super stickers were seen on a couple livestreams viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and a reporter saw ads playing on an RT livestream.  YouTube’s rules say that videos and livestreams must adhere to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/#community-guidelines"&gt;site’s community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in order to be monetized, and they state that videos inciting or encouraging violence and showing violent imagery are not allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuyVCfPBilG6UMlD1FeBxRst0-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218237/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_3.43.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the “Super Chat” tips sent into a livestream. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdxh3W"&gt;Even so, it’s unclear if the livestreams themselves violate YouTube’s community guidelines. A YouTube representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “our teams are monitoring today’s events.” YouTube does allow certain videos to remain up if they have proper news context, but that’s often judged on a case-by-case basis. On a number of videos that contain terms like “Stop the Steal” or “Patriots Capitol” in the title, YouTube has also included an information box that states “the electoral college has confirmed Joe Biden as president-elect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVqPZ2"&gt;Outside of livestreams, YouTube seemed to surface content from authoritative sources, like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and NBC. However, searching YouTube for “Stop the Steal” streams using Google Chrome’s Incognito mode highlighted videos from RT and channels with names like “Agentsix1,” “The Truth,” and “Real News Live.” YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992018/youtube-borderline-content-recommendation-algorithm-news-authoritative-sources"&gt;changed its search algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to try to prevent this kind of borderline content — videos that aren’t prohibited, but contain disturbing or harmful subject matter — from surfacing as top results on the platform. It is unclear how effective that measure is in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlS3k"&gt;Coverage of the event was harder to find on Twitch. Though the site is built around live video, its search features make it somewhat difficult to find live coverage of political events, so users largely have to browse through the site’s categories to find relevant live broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCygnh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch commenters responded in astonishment at what they were seeing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eTdnRP"&gt;Most streams on Twitch were from people commenting from afar. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch the streamer HayliNic talk about what she was seeing on CNN’s broadcast of the event at the Capitol, and thousands were tuned into a stream from Hutch, who was chatting over live footage from C-SPAN. The popular political streamer HasanAbi had around 100,000 people watching him talk about the event while flipping between news coverage and aggregated views of various streamers from the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxpQw5"&gt;Direct streams from DC were less popular. DylanBurnsTV had just under 1,000 people watching his stream while he was standing away from the protests; elsewhere, close to 900 people watched TouringNews’ coverage from within a crowd. Commenters on these streams tended to express their astonishment at what they were seeing, shocked at the protestors’ attempt to stop the certification of the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8wPCM"&gt;Twitch didn’t appear to have any political labels or warning messages on these streams pointing viewers to verified information, unlike platforms like YouTube and Twitter. Twitch has largely evaded the pressure faced by YouTube and other platforms in recent years, in part because its lengthy broadcasts can be harder to review, and in part because the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915580/twitch-moderation-communities-ceo-emmett-shear-twitchcon"&gt;seems to take a more aggressive stance on moderating speech&lt;/a&gt;, rather than attempting to be a platform for anything and everything. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;President Trump was briefly banned&lt;/a&gt; in June for broadcasting “hateful” language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W98vLr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tone was decidedly different on pro-Trump social platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYA4k"&gt;On Facebook, it was easy to find footage from the protests. A stream from NewsNationNow, which was being carried by a number of local news stations, appeared to have more than 20,000 viewers across a number of channels it was being broadcast on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzMiA"&gt;As the mob stormed the Capitol, Facebook and Instagram continued to allow searches for #stopthesteal, and the posts were presented without warning labels. It was hard to find live videos through the hashtag on Facebook, which mostly surfaced older information. On Instagram, the hashtag was filled with screenshots of tweets presented alongside photos and videos of people rushing into the Capitol. One video appeared to show police officers pushing back protestors who tried to rush by them further into the building. Instagram told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is reviewing the hashtag and would take action if it is found to violate the platform’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGQXQX"&gt;The tone was decidedly different on Parler — a right-wing Twitter clone — where users mostly posted in support of the protest. “They pushed patriots too far,” one wrote. “1776 HAS COMMENCED AGAIN!!!” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKDPT8"&gt;On TheDonald.win, a successor to the banned subreddit r/The_Donald, a forum thread was posted as a central location to watch and chat as “PATRIOTS STORM THE CAPITOL.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘felony streaming’ measure is aimed at piracy services, not Twitch streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-HEARING-BANKING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1NHKOnCEC6e4pejDMhXKMi2j7Y=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567803/1229890894.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AL DRAGO/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gXrIH"&gt;Yes, Congress approved a new bill Monday that would classify illegal streaming as a felony offense, but the feds won’t be going after your favorite Twitch streamers, YouTubers, or their subscribers. They’re more interested in services dedicated to streaming pirated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir5jYQ"&gt;Monday night, Congress approved &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;an over $2 trillion government&lt;/a&gt; spending and coronavirus relief package that included a handful of controversial copyright and trademark measures. A felony streaming bill, authored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), was included as part of that massive package. The news circulated all across the internet; in a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/the-covid-19-stimulus-bill-would-make-illegal-streaming-a-felony"&gt;poorly headlined &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;article, tweets, and YouTube videos. Quickly, content creators and their fans grew increasingly concerned that the bill could threaten their livelihoods or their favorite means of entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEn8JQ"&gt;But according to a press release from Tillis’ office and statements made by tech advocacy groups like Public Knowledge, streamers and their fans have no cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79Uq7E"&gt;“As a general matter, we do not see the need for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement,” Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-responds-to-senator-tillis-felony-streaming-copyright-proposal/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. “However, this bill is narrowly tailored and avoids criminalizing users, who may do nothing more than click on a link, or upload a file. It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfmXR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CafsyX"&gt;The text of the bill affirms this reading. On its fourth page, &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-legislation-led-by-tillis-and-leahy-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations-to-be-signed-into-law"&gt;the bill outlines&lt;/a&gt; what would qualify as felony behavior under the law. Currently, streaming unlicensed content is a misdemeanor offense. Previously, organizations like the NFL would sue sites like NFLBite that recast games, but if approved, the Tillis measures would open the door for the FBI to pursue those website owners under threat of prison time. But while the penalties and enforcement are both stepping up, the bill wouldn’t change what’s legal and what’s not. More importantly, there’s nothing in the text of the bill that suggests platforms’ moderation of everyday copyright violations would need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjiikh"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/covid-relief-bill-still-includes-felony-streaming-act-1845929782"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Tillis’ office describing the purpose of the legislation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FghP3u"&gt;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act will apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fqIRyY"&gt;Still, it’s totally understandable that YouTubers and streamers would freak out about a bill whose final text was released only days before it was approved. Social video platforms haven’t done the best job in the past with copyright, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims, and strikes. YouTube’s algorithm frequently flags content as violating copyright even when it doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037763/youtube-copyright-claim-studios-update-automatic-trim-tool-studios"&gt;For a long time&lt;/a&gt;, copyright owners like Universal were able to claim videos without expressly stating where the copyrighted material appeared in the content. Copyright is messy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iog8Af"&gt;On December 16th, Twitch addressed this proposal in its town hall, saying that the company did not expect the bill to affect its platform or its users. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qy95f"&gt;That doesn’t mean copyright activists can rest easy. The multitrillion-dollar package did include a copyright measure that civil liberties activists fear could have dramatic consequences. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;The CASE Act&lt;/a&gt; was also approved in the package and would create a quasi-judicial copyright claims court within the Copyright Office. Copyright holders could be awarded up to $30,000 in damages if they find their creative work being shared online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um2tAb"&gt;There’s also more bad copyright news coming from Sen. Tillis in the next congressional term. The senator is planning to offer up additional copyright changes next year that have already spooked the tech and creative industries. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBordelon/status/1341399864287096839?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that Tillis has been circulating a draft proposal of a bill that would completely reform the DMCA. The bill would include a “&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything"&gt;notice-and-staydown&lt;/a&gt;” provision that could make copyright bots, like YouTube’s Content ID, stricter. &lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that Tillis’ office would limit this provision to “complete or near-complete works” and would focus on larger enterprises rather than small platforms or creators. Still, current copyright-striking tech has been hit-or-miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlX3NZ"&gt;“This proposal [the incoming DMCA reform] would result in massive legal uncertainties for small businesses, startups and new creators; hurt competition and consumer choice for the next generation of platforms like TikTok and Parler; and lead to significant overblocking of everyday content on the platforms that Americans use every day to work, communicate and have fun,” said Joshua Lamel, executive director of the Re:Create Coalition, in a &lt;a href="https://www.recreatecoalition.org/press_release/recreate-statement-on-proposal-to-undo-the-dmca-would-fundamentally-end-online-creativity-as-we-know-it/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tuPIb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvCTCb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cooking videos were one small savior of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czkdQnMAlPci8islJ_2EYJTHe1A=/165x0:2112x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556333/remicruz.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9q8dc"&gt;Early one morning, a week after the pandemic started, chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt strapped a GoPro to his head and filmed himself making breakfast. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw2UyqIaik"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;, you can see López-Alt rummaging through his fridge, slicing and frying bacon, and peeling a bit of egg off a pan to give to his excited dog. There’s no recipe beneath the video, no voice-over instructions detailing what we’re seeing — it’s just a guy in a kitchen making breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9tqPq"&gt;Videos like these became both much-needed entertainment and valuable educational resources early in the pandemic, as a world of people realized they would be stuck at home indefinitely with their own (not necessarily stunning) cooking, and a little extra time to put into it. Food and drink streams surged in popularity on Twitch, doubling in hours watched year over year in August, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.streamelements.com/state-of-the-stream-august-2020-fall-guys-has-an-incredible-debut-shroud-returns-to-twitch-and-9689227dc972"&gt;StreamElements and Arsenal.gg&lt;/a&gt;. On YouTube, “cook with me” videos more than doubled in popularity starting in March and maintained that growth through October, YouTube told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/youtube-babish-cooking-shows-virus-339e5283220590ab3c250ef54c946895"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pJjVo"&gt;“It gives [viewers] confidence to do stuff in the kitchen,” said López-Alt, author of &lt;em&gt;The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science&lt;/em&gt;. His own videos lack the polish and perfect cuts of a professional show and include the slip-ups he makes along the way. “It gives them permission to make mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VWAve"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2zBtiYF5Gw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tX9Rt2"&gt;Cooking shows have been around for a century, but new formats online have revitalized the genre in recent years. On YouTube in particular, you can find step-by-step instructional lessons, personal “cook with me” vlogs, and stomach-churning food challenges like stuffing McDonald’s burgers and nuggets into an oversized burrito. On Twitch, chefs and home cooks broadcast themselves live from their kitchen as they prepare meals. And on TikTok, you can watch videos teaching you how to make a new dish in under a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSjXA4"&gt;Many hosts noticed a pickup in views and engagement as the pandemic went on. “It definitely has been skyrocket high with the views on things you can do at home,” Zahria Harvey, whose YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XOZAHRIAAA/videos"&gt;XO. ZAHRIAAA&lt;/a&gt; is known for “cook with me” videos, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Harvey says one viewer wrote in about making an affordable date night meal featured on her channel for an anniversary dinner because she couldn’t go out to dinner. “It was like wow, these videos are actually helping a lot of people during this time,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eL6sih"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v838587873&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dRAsrl"&gt;The influx of new viewers has also meant more live interaction for hosts on Twitch. “I find that the community is way more vocal and involved past March this year,” L.A., a photographer and former sushi chef who runs the channel &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thehungerservice"&gt;The Hunger Service&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. L.A.’s streams typically run for three to four hours and show him preparing and cooking a meal, talking through his process as he’s working. As he cooks, viewers ask questions about the process, like how sharp a knife needs to be or how to turn a recipe vegan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt3q5P"&gt;For López-Alt, who’s known for his &lt;em&gt;Serious Eats &lt;/em&gt;column, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt/videos"&gt;his channel&lt;/a&gt; became a fun outlet for both him and his viewers. The format he locked into — strapping a GoPro to his head — is what made video finally click for him, and it helped him reach viewers who weren’t familiar with his writing. “The food I cook on my channel is stuff I was generally making for lunch and for dinner,” López-Alt said. “I could do it consistently, people seemed to like it, [and] I enjoyed making it.” Viewers told him the videos were a bright spot and were helping them learn how to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NKbuw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8h2MO1vPRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJeJvX"&gt;Some creators have found that the surge in interest in their channels extends beyond cooking. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RemLife/featured"&gt;Remi Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber who frequently features cooking on her two channels, said that people have been more interested in basically anything you can do at home. For “vlogmas,” she’s been using cooking to fill the gap where she’d normally vlog about outdoor activities and holiday shopping. “I’ve just been implementing some sort of cooking-related thing every day, and people genuinely love it,” Cruz told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xwpkx"&gt;Viewers won’t always end up cooking what they see, but these videos can still make their time in the kitchen a bit more fun — or at least, distract them while they think about the great meals they’ll eventually go back out to a restaurant and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKe0J2"&gt;“People are looking for some sort of comfort,” L.A. said. “Comfort food is a thing, and watching these shows can offer that comfort. You may not be making it at the time, but maybe you will.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zk7m8O"&gt;YouTube started the last few years off with nothing short of catastrophic headlines about some of its creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcBdQ"&gt;2017 saw Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg receive global criticism for a video in which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14605060/pewdiepie-disney-deal-lost-nazi-anti-semitic-imagery"&gt;displayed anti-Semitic imagery&lt;/a&gt;; 2018 found Logan Paul uploading footage of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest"&gt;dead body to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; 2019 ushered in loot crate controversies and dangerous stunts by top personalities like Jake Paul who took part in the &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; challenge by driving while blindfolded, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184382/bird-box-challenge-youtube-policies-tide-pods-thumbnails-external-links"&gt;fundamental policy changes&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Those events were only within the first few weeks of each year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt4kap"&gt;2020 was much quieter. The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters. That’s not to suggest YouTube had a perfect year; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;faced ongoing misinformation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52662348"&gt;plagues on its platform&lt;/a&gt;, faced intense scrutiny for its lack of action around governing the platform &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/youtube-under-pressure-over-election-falsehoods-suspends-oan-for-covid-19-misinformation.html"&gt;during the federal election&lt;/a&gt;, and is still figuring out how to handle a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/google-faces-3-2b-lawsuit-over-claims-it-violated-childrens-privacy/"&gt;number of issues&lt;/a&gt; with videos featuring kids. YouTube did not have a great 2020, but it wasn’t driven by a never-ending whirlwind of creator chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdgHwJ"&gt;It may have been factors brought on by the pandemic and the arrival of an enormous new rival that helped YouTube. The pandemic made it harder for creators to get together to film (although that didn’t stop some of YouTube’s more popular stars from &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jake-paul-interview-party-coronavirus-calabasas-mayor-2020-7"&gt;throwing parties at their Los Angeles mansions&lt;/a&gt;). Prank videos reliant on collaborations or travel diaries that can go astray were forced to transform into videos that could be filmed inside. Members of the “Vlog Squad,” one of YouTube’s most popular collaboration groups, worked on creative sketches that didn’t require them to be in each other’s space all the time, and Logan Paul mostly focused on his podcast that records in his California home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v3dr0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlLSE6"&gt;If YouTube had a quieter year, part of that is because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/10/21285309/tiktok-2020-user-numbers-revenue-smash-hit-mea-culpa"&gt;TikTok exploded in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. YouTubers also turned to TikTok as a way to continue making videos, staying on people’s radars, and having fun within a new ecosystem. Prominent YouTubers like Trisha Paytas, David Dobrik, James Charles, and Cody Ko have all been posting to TikTok regularly, building big audiences and even partaking in TikTok’s first creators program to earn additional revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1QUbv"&gt;Focus shifted to TikTok and a new class of creators who were experiencing meteoric rises to mainstream fame. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;Addison Rae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438111/charli-damelio-tiktok-triller-app-rival-dixie-marc-heidi"&gt;Charli D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, Chase Hudson, Josh Richards, and countless others found their way into the spotlight — and it was TikTokers whose questionable behavior was highlighted throughout the year. A pair of popular TikTokers was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405427/tiktok-parties-los-angeles-criminal-charges-bryce-hall-blake-gray"&gt;charged by the city of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; for throwing parties in a mansion, high-profile breakups and cheating scandals became &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/style/tik-tok-drama-taylor-lorenz.html"&gt;part of the “TikTokpocalypse,”&lt;/a&gt; and the possibility of everything disappearing after President Trump called for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;TikTok to be shut down&lt;/a&gt; sent the creator community into a panic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGUz1L"&gt;For years, YouTube has been the center of young creators doing dumb things and receiving global press for their antics. It was a never-ending cascade of pranks gone bad, mindless stunts, and fake drama spun up to generate hundreds of millions of views. It worked. Between 2016 and 2019, YouTubers were constantly in the news for the wrong reasons. The heyday of weird content on YouTube that attracted comedy lovers and people who lived online was replaced by a new era of teenagers with access to a lot of cash, no boundaries, and friends all trying to generate lucrative views on every video they posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5NYW"&gt;YouTube didn’t introduce a slew of new policies that suddenly made every creator on the platform start behaving. YouTube got lucky — people weren’t able to get into the same hijinks they could before. The company &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;tried over the years to mitigate poor behavior, but what helped the platform this year is the thing that, ironically, helped creators grow in the first place: making collaborations in very public, packed spaces became nearly impossible to do. CEO Susan Wojcicki once referred to the period between early 2017 and mid-2018 as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-25-susan-wojcicki-youtube-moderation/"&gt;YouTube’s “growing up years.”&lt;/a&gt; The executive wanted to find a way to move past the endless headlines about antics performed by popular creators on her platform. 2020 showed what a year of sensibility could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HLRufC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kduqVh"&gt;YouTube hasn’t grown up; its stars are still bickering with each other and getting into boxing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22158034/floyd-mayweather-logan-paul-fight-date-announced"&gt;matches with Floyd Mayweather&lt;/a&gt;. And YouTube creators were caught in various scandals this year. Old videos of Shane Dawson using blackface and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308288/shane-dawson-youtube-suspends-monetization-channels-blackface-older-videos"&gt;derogatory language resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;, leading to his channel being demonetized for a period of time. Jenna Marbles left the internet altogether after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21306858/shane-dawson-jenna-marbles-youtube-blackface-racism-content"&gt;racially insensitive videos resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;. Beauty mogul and YouTuber Jeffree Star found himself in a world of drama over &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9"&gt;alleged inappropriate past behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Jake Paul, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"&gt;continued to be Jake Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvgEB"&gt;The platform’s culture didn’t change in one year — but by happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to. In the early days of the pandemic, YouTube felt like old-school YouTube again. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;videos, always popular, seemed to soar even more as people had more time to play and make videos; people returned to daily vlogging; and lo-fi chillhop streams became hangouts for people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"&gt;stuck at home and trying to work&lt;/a&gt;. It was a quieter period for YouTube’s creators and a weird moment for anyone who’s tracked the site’s culture. For once, I’m not regularly talking about a severe incident to which a creator contributed. Instead, the greatest problems YouTube faced this year were on the policy side relating to misinformation and polarizing content — in many ways, problems of YouTube’s own making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gsVmb"&gt;I have no doubt that when YouTubers can start hanging out with each other there’ll be more headlines about antics. But for the first time in a few years, a year is ending without a YouTuber’s cataclysmic news cycle as the story of the year within the creator community. I genuinely didn’t think it was possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the pandemic inspired creative uses of technology in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEYyUpKLw8iwFwkfRnE3oB9potM=/205x0:1732x1018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68552676/one_zoom_to_rule_them_all_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Josh Gad’s Reunited Apart brought together the cast of the Lord of the Rings movies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5Rmva"&gt;The year that brought us the coronavirus pandemic, murder hornets, and the deaths of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Alex Trebek is probably one most people won’t be sad to bid adieu. Parents and kids were stuck together during lockdowns, trying to manage remote school and work, and everyone’s feeling good and frayed at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypCje1"&gt;At the start of the pandemic, media was abuzz with the notion that this pandemic and the resulting lockdowns would be a boon for the creative process. Suffering and isolation, the logic goes, beget great works of art and literature: just look at &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/broadway-shutdown-could-be-good-theater-coronavirus/607993/"&gt;Shakespeare, who apparently cranked out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Lear&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/em&gt; while quarantined during an outbreak of bubonic plague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="amwXv9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We built a 2020 time capsule out of synthetic DNA — here’s how","url":"https://www.theverge.com/science/22188122/dna-data-storage-synthetic-time-capsule"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jvr26F"&gt;While we may not yet know if another Shakespeare found their muse during the current pandemic, plenty of people found their creative spark thanks to technology, with librarians, artists, and even epidemiologists using the tools at hand not just to distract from the tedium of lockdown, but to put forth new approaches to how we learn and connect with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P7hhvl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;Librarians used Google Forms to create virtual escape rooms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Harry Potter escape room" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5EhT5Fc_DG9xnD9QDJtFMvDf04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20083663/Screen_Shot_2020_07_14_at_3.40.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;em&gt; escape room starts off by telling players where in the Wizarding World they are.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1bq9Ow"&gt;The easy-to-use format of Google Forms allowed librarians and teachers to create problem-solving exercises for students designed as digital versions of escape rooms. In addition to solving the puzzle of the game, the escape rooms let kids hone their geography, math, and reading comprehension skills, and are built around fun themes that included &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt;, and Marvel superheroes. Not only did they take away some of the tedium and chaos of online teaching and learning, but the virtual escape rooms were tools for staff development and community building. Brooke Windsor, a librarian in Ontario, put it this way: “We still want to sneak in that learning, broccoli-in-the-brownie style.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2QunsV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213184/tim-dunk-facetime-photoshoots-wedding-photography-lockdown"&gt;A photographer used FaceTime to create professional-looking portraits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzOf4M9xG5wUDXAv_tlv_LLK6fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22178797/facetime_photo_shoots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://timdunk.com/facetime-photoshoots" target="_blank"&gt;Tim Dunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographer Tim Dunk helped users create professional-quality photos via iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vcGMKJ"&gt;As big weddings were (mostly) canceled and postponed in 2020, UK wedding photographer Tim Dunk decided he needed another project to keep his creative juices flowing. “I had to deal with the shock and financial implications of [the coronavirus] like any other photographer. It also threw up another challenge: how do we as creatives stay creative?” &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2020/04/06/how-to-shoot-portraits-through-facetime/"&gt;Dunk wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7EmLQ"&gt;His solution: FaceTime photo shoots. The photo subject and Dunk connect on FaceTime, and he determines where the light in their house is best for a portrait. Then, using the Live Photo button on the iPhone (sorry, Android users) that lets you take photos during a FaceTime call, he snaps the pictures, then edits them in Lightroom. And £10 from every shoot — he charges £50 for a set of 10 to 15 photos — goes to the &lt;a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/about/"&gt;Trussell Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based charitable organization that supports food banks. He’s also created photo books of some of the portraits taken during the project, and he &lt;a href="https://timdunk.com/how-to-shoot-portraits-through-facetime"&gt;penned a how-to&lt;/a&gt; for other photographers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gxcZ1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/80s-zoom-reunion-josh-gad-film-giants-lockdown-reunited-apart-frozen-olaf"&gt;Josh Gad created Gen X nostalgia on Zoom by reuniting movie casts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q9qns"&gt;Okay, so not all of the movies in Gad’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCd3u3uQ0DtlDfVU0GlKpQ"&gt;Reunited Apart&lt;/a&gt; YouTube series are from the 1980s, but the casts of &lt;em&gt;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Splash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Goonies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; meeting on Zoom brought back the faces of some cultural touchstones of the American Gen-X childhood. Each episode benefits a different charitable organization and garners thousands, and in some cases, millions of views. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_U0S6x_kCs&amp;amp;ab_channel=JoshGad"&gt;One Zoom to Rule Them All&lt;/a&gt; episode featuring the cast of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; drew 5.7 million views and benefited nonprofit organization &lt;a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/"&gt;No Kid Hungry&lt;/a&gt;. “Everybody is going through the same craziness, trying to operate in a world that’s still very new and complicated, where our sole connection is through the internet,” Gad &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/80s-zoom-reunion-josh-gad-film-giants-lockdown-reunited-apart-frozen-olaf"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kN0UGS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/creative-ways-teachers-are-using-social-media-during-the-pandemic"&gt;A teacher created science projects on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="UblerN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrs.b.tv/video/6906654550380285190" data-video-id="6906654550380285190" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@mrs.b.tv" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrs.b.tv"&gt;@mrs.b.tv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie! &lt;a title="learnontiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/learnontiktok"&gt;#learnontiktok&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a title="happyholidays" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/happyholidays"&gt;#happyholidays&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="holidaycrafts" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/holidaycrafts"&gt;#holidaycrafts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="scienceexperiments" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/scienceexperiments"&gt;#scienceexperiments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="scienceathome" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/scienceathome"&gt;#scienceathome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Christmas Hip Hop 3 - Tini Mc" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Christmas-Hip-Hop-3-6839817225558296577"&gt;♬ Christmas Hip Hop 3 - Tini Mc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KtRNAT"&gt;If any app is having a moment in 2020, it’s the ubiquitous TikTok — fighting the Trump administration in court and at the same time becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/10/21285309/tiktok-2020-user-numbers-revenue-smash-hit-mea-culpa"&gt;most-downloaded app in the world&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. Jacksonville, Florida science teacher Nancy Bullard created a Mrs. B TV on TikTok, dressing like everything from an astronaut to a chicken in the name of science. Bullard guides students through science experiments they can do without parental supervision, so parents working from home can have a bit of a reprieve. The response from students has been overwhelmingly positive, &lt;a href="https://www.cms.k12.nc.us/News/Pages/Mrs.-B-TV-Science-teacher-gets-creative-to-reach-students.aspx"&gt;Bullard said&lt;/a&gt;. “Whether it is the latest dance trend or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, we have to find our kids on the platforms they’re comfortable with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZKBUyo"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545725/fauci-tufts-chart-mood-coronavirus-medicine"&gt;An epidemiologist created a Level of Fauci meme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edsj_DahYip5keonamfJOLd9ATU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22007308/fauci_level.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Karen Errichetti&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Fauci’s facial expressions say it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GXvAyI"&gt;During the coronavirus pandemic, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Anthony Fauci has become one of its most recognizable faces — and it’s an extremely expressive face that usually conveys what he’s thinking. Epidemiologist Karen Sautter Errichetti needed a way to check in with how her students were coping with... everything... and created an unscientific chart based on the five-part Likert scale, using photos of Fauci on a one to five scale (later expanded to a nine-photo scale) so students could choose their mood for that day. Photos of the NIAID director smiling were the most difficult to find, Errichetti noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc18sP"&gt;Word is that Fauci himself has seen the scale, which is not quite the introduction Errichetti envisioned; she and her colleagues consider him a rock star of sorts. “Creating your own memes,” Errichetti told me, “that’s a little bit of your own kind of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1cWUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sarah Cooper reflects on her whirlwind 2020 of Trump impressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1Wn9iJ6-_mwvhpS5IIQPrEsFfM=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547087/SCEF_Unit_06181R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Cooper in her Netflix special, &lt;/em&gt;Everything’s Fine&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Lacey Terrell / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens when a product designer becomes a creator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLg2i3"&gt;If you were on social media — &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;social media — in 2020, you probably saw a video of Sarah Cooper lip-syncing to President Donald Trump’s public appearances. And while her early videos were &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme?lang=en"&gt;made using TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, they migrated to Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. As the year ends, Cooper has a Netflix special called &lt;em&gt;Everything’s Fine&lt;/em&gt; under her belt and is developing TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKiUYG"&gt;Before all that, though, there was TikTok, perhaps best thought of as a video editing tool with a distribution network conveniently attached. Cooper tried it out, with stupendous results. Though she’d previously written two books, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/100-Tricks-Appear-Smart-Meetings/dp/1449476058?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GF3C6Y8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;it was her madcap take on Trump — the president as bad boss — that launched her into celebrity status. Cooper brought the observational style she honed working at companies like Google and Flickr to her study of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8y4bA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DzSVDm"&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them,” Cooper says. ”And that’s kind of true for companies. You see how the CEO acts. You see how leadership acts, and everybody imitates that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSYfNg"&gt;Unlike many other product designers, Cooper now finds herself on the other end of products — as a creator. It’s hard to monetize on TikTok and virtually impossible on Twitter, where Cooper feels her community is. Of all the platforms, YouTube was the one that gave her a financial windfall when she posted her videos. “It was really more like an afterthought, but in terms of monetization, it’s the only place really to make money with videos,” Cooper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzwDLa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme/video/6819061413877763334" data-video-id="6819061413877763334" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@whatchugotforme" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme"&gt;@whatchugotforme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6819046896666004229"&gt;♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wlv8xz"&gt;Moving to Netflix was similarly surreal — Cooper remembers when Netflix was just a DVD-by-mail startup. Now, of course, the company produces original content, including her own, which was produced by Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph and full of celebrity cameos. “I completely clammed up with Jon Hamm because I’ve watched every season of &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, like twice,” Cooper says. Also, she regrets not asking Winona Ryder what filming &lt;em&gt;Edward Scissorhands&lt;/em&gt; was like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUI9Nj"&gt;But, of course, the production was shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, with on-set tests, a virus scare, and Zoom meetings. “Everything was on Zoom, which is sad because I think Google Hangouts is a pretty good tool,” Cooper says. “I was on Hangouts at Google all the time.” We asked her to reflect on her whirlwind year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOcnTj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ2enk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had a big 2020. How are you thinking about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMh5UM"&gt;It’s been the biggest year of my career. I’m actually working on things, for the first time in my life, that I’m so excited to be working on. I’m doing right now, what I’ve always, always wanted to do. And so it’s just weird to feel that way about this year, but then also feel like, fuck 2020. Can’t wait until it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p3njEj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Work is just this fascinating place.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgDGAG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work seems like your most important subject. From &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, there’s a through-line to Trump. How did your interest in workplace dynamics play a role in what you’ve created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m71T7F"&gt;I fought it for a long time because I thought it wasn’t cool to talk about work. But work is just this fascinating place. At first, when I started making the Trump videos, I didn’t really know how they fit in with everything else I was doing. Then looking back, it was like, “Oh yeah, everything he does is this performance that he’s putting on&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;That’s the through-line of everything that I do. We’re all sort of putting on a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc86JK"&gt;I had this idea when I was like 21 that I was going to make a blog called My Life on Stage, because I always felt like I was performing, wherever I went. Work is just, it’s like a prime place for that kind of thing. Especially in tech, because you’re there because you’re being paid, because it’s a job. But in tech, you’re also supposed to be very passionate and excited about everything, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk9rwZ"&gt;That was kind of what led to me leaving Google really. I felt like I was living this double life. I was so much more passionate about writing than I was about what I was doing at work. And yet I had to be a manager, which means being a cheerleader, which means talking about how this is the greatest thing we’re doing... The project we’re working on right now is so important and it’s going to change the world and all of these things. And I just didn’t feel that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AItAMx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really curious about how your background as a designer informed your approach to social media platforms. How did you think about trying to build an audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZRzo1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2qa6D"&gt;Well, I’ve been trying to build an audience for a very long time. It’s just been a process of like, building an audience and kind of getting bored with something and then rebuilding and rebuilding and rebuilding. I was always just trying new platforms, new video platforms, new ways to share ideas online. I just tried everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5192g"&gt;I had my own blog for a while, thecooperreview.com. One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch, even when the blog went viral. A lot of these social platforms just have built-in ways of sharing and built-in ways of creating audiences. So I realized it was a lot easier to try to build an audience through Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIX4RI"&gt;That’s kind of why I tried TikTok. Everybody was doing it and I had nothing better to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQBeEy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You moved away from using the TikTok editing tool. When did that happen and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGn56N"&gt;TikTok’s [editing tool is] very chronological. I have different characters in my videos and it’s not like I could shoot all of one character, all of the other character, and then edit them together. It was really like me sequentially, like, now I’m Trump, now I’m the person responding to Trump, now I’m Trump again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnBc0z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8WWdYldVg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9whupN"&gt;But when I wanted to do anything that was longer than 60 seconds, it was just more complicated. I think the first one I did, on my own, without TikTok, was Don Jr. interviewing his dad for Father’s Day. Then I did “person, woman, two man camera” and that was just a longer video, almost two minutes. You can’t make anything over 60 seconds on TikTok, so I just had my own little hacky way of lip-syncing and recording myself and then editing it in Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdXaHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you think about moving your audience from social networks to Netflix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzT8GW"&gt;A long time ago, I wanted to make a video making fun of how Gary Vaynerchuk is on YouTube telling people to follow him on Twitter. And he’s on Twitter telling people to follow his Facebook. And then he’s on Facebook telling people to follow... So, he’s just like trying to get people to follow him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1voL3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2qIgE"&gt;I just don’t think that works. I feel like you need to meet people where they are and if people are on YouTube, bring your stuff to YouTube, and let them view it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIVqRj"&gt;With Netflix, it was just funny because I’d be on a call with Netflix marketing, and they’d be telling me about personalization and how their platform works and stuff like that. When I worked in tech, I used to design personalization features. It’s really interesting, being on these different sides of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUI9sM"&gt;I’d worked at Flickr and I left Flickr to do acting. I was doing a little bit of modeling and I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed. It’s kind of cool, seeing the other side of it, coming from a perspective of like, first I was designing these experiences, and now I’m creating content for these experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08WMrf"&gt;It gives me a better understanding of how things work. Like, how to caption things so that people will be intrigued by them — so that you don’t give it away, but you pique their interest. And all of these things, I feel like I’ve honed over the decades I’ve wasted in social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waw1yE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the most extreme example of dogfooding I think I’ve ever heard of. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyEd4n"&gt;Cut to doing the Netflix special, where I was doing the &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; bus scene with Dame Helen Mirren and trying to teach her how to TikTok. I would kill to be Dame Helen Mirren! And she’s like, “How do I lip sync? And I’m like, “Why am I teaching you how to lip-sync? You should not be lip-syncing. You’re Shakespearean-trained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ivZiXV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRu-QUeqoMs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8sluJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netflix special would have been a time crunch in any year. But we also have a pandemic. How did that affect filming? How did that affect the collaboration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADt1V7"&gt;Not only was it my first special; it was my first COVID production. It was a lot of people’s first COVID production. There were a lot of masks. There was a COVID specialist on set. There was a lot of like, “Hey, you guys are too close.” Or, “Do you need some hand sanitizer?” Constant COVID tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frRRGw"&gt;The last day, I walked onto set, and they took my temperature. I had a temperature, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m trying so hard not to get sick,” because I didn’t want to shut down this whole production. And now on the last day, I have a temperature! But it turned out I was just standing in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c57b9o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you focusing on television, or will we still see you on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="voprvC"&gt;I’ll always be on Twitter. I can never get away, for some reason. For the foreseeable future, I’m going to be focused on TV. But I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get away from social media. Plus, I think it’s HBO Max, is now going to be releasing all their films, simultaneously, online as well as in theaters. And so, all these big movie stars are all internet stars now. We’re just all on the internet now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Checking in on everyone who went remote this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="YtzU3H"&gt;2020 has been a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, not least because much of the world pivoted to remote work. Industries that typically rely on in-person connections, like fitness and religious institutions, found themselves having to engage their audiences through live streams. Ad revenue disappeared from influencers and YouTubers, who are used to working remotely so long as they make money. Fashion influencers whose livelihoods depend on peddling an image of beauty and aspirational clothing were without events to attend or reasons to get dressed. Everyone needed to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brc2fz"&gt;In this piece, we look back on a few people we previously interviewed this year to hear how their remote transition has gone — do they anticipate staying remote? What have they learned from this challenging year? And will we collectively agree to forget 2020 ever happened and try to resume normalcy in 2021?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhB6In"&gt;Check out what they said below, and click through on the posts to read the original pieces mentioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0IyvrQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21193904/instagram-therapy-live-sessions-covid-19-coronavirus-posts-influencers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What she was up to when we last chatted at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fR2b50"&gt;In March, Mancao began pivoting her therapy Instagram account to address COVID-related stress and anxiety. She had just posted her first couple test posts covering the pandemic, including one called “COVID-19 Compassionate Reminders,” which suggested checking in on friends and family who are immunocompromised and donating to small businesses that might be struggling. She saw her Instagram as a way to reach people who might be interested in therapy but might not be able to financially afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1j4uM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s doing now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wopFkg"&gt;Nine months later, Mancao says she’s actually moved her content away from pandemic-related topics because ample information is already available, and “COVID content overload can really exhaust and burn people out.” She’ll post about the pandemic if necessary, though, like when she recently posted about setting boundaries with friends and family who might want to hang in-person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wrdu4U"&gt;Although Macao’s business has managed to stay afloat with new clients, she says other therapists she knows have struggled. Clients lost their insurance and income and can no longer afford services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXazA"&gt;Many of her clients talk about burnout and the struggle with working, living, and having time off all in the same place: their home. She herself has focused on practicing what she advises, like not working from her bed and finding a routine that works for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gANF9i"&gt;“This year really taught us to find that balance between staying connected and having boundaries,” she says. Instagram is still a powerful, and free, place for her to spread information, but she’s found that throughout 2020, a post caption doesn’t capture the nuance of every situation and circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

Dana encourages us to think of and pray for the people in our lives as we string lights and hang ornaments in the coming days.

Thank you for joining us for this service of Morning Prayer and Reflection. Your support is appreciated!

*Please note that these services are filmed in advance.*&lt;/p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/12141462551"&gt;Washington National Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, December 8, 2020&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1qz7q3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Eckstrom, spokesman for the Washington National Cathedral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQbEIK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21209540/passover-easter-seder-zoom-holiday-celebration-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the cathedral was doing in April, right before Easter Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dpVQU4"&gt;Eckstrom and the team at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC, were preparing for virtual Easter services when we last chatted. The team had already been streaming live services on Sundays, but Easter was a major test of their remote work. It’s an essential day for the cathedral, which is typically packed with 3,000 people in the building. The remote operation involved only 10 people in the building at once with the clergy tailoring the service to the pandemic. They took “spiritual” communions in which they consecrated the bread and wine without actually consuming it. They said a special prayer, too, which expressed that they wanted to take communion but couldn’t at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V8lc8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the church has been doing since&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNTas"&gt;The team is now preparing for Christmas services, and in the months since the pandemic started, the cathedral’s services have reached 1.8 million people and average between 6,000 and 7,500 people streaming Sunday morning services. The cathedral team has focused its live stream efforts on how best to make services resonate remotely, rather than making them an “afterthought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1eNei"&gt;“We will be doing essentially two separate versions of the same thing for the foreseeable future, and that’s a kind of a radical shift for us to put as much energy and attention into an online experience as we are into the in-person experience,” Eckstrom says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSTGR"&gt;Although some global viewers might eventually return to their home church when cities, states, and countries eventually open up, Eckstrom says some attendees say the virtual ceremonies have become a routine they want to continue. The cathedral considers the online world a second location at this point and will continue to stream after the pandemic wanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83KsCo"&gt;At the same time, however, monetizing the streams hasn’t been easy, especially with no in-person visits. The cathedral anticipates a loss of $5 million this year, mainly because of the lack of tourists buying things in the gift shop and café, and from the loss in event rentals. The team now solicits online donations, and although people have given money, it hasn’t made up for the lack of in-person visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFUp1n"&gt;“People want to make a visceral physical connection,” he says. “And that’s really hard to replicate online. We can use some of [the in-person cathedral experience], but not all of it, so we’re really anxious to be able to reopen the door, so that people can have that experience that we’ve been working on developing for about 113 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KATqQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bee Roper and Theo Gove-Humphries, vanlife YouTubers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SBr7tJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21228400/vanlife-influencers-instagram-youtube-coronavirus-pandemic-impact-space-food-income"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where in the world they were at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PBYuCz"&gt;Theo Gove-Humphries and Bee Roper had planned, before the pandemic, to fly themselves and their van from the UK to Canada and make their way throughout North America. But as soon as their visas were approved, Canada banned most inbound flights. The UK then shut its borders, too. The couple decided to move into the home of a friend, who themselves was stuck abroad, and focused on writing an ebook about their Scandinavian travels. YouTube sponsorship opportunities slowed down and their ad revenue decreased, so they need to find a way to diversify their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9MVHW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where they are now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl2GVo"&gt;Gove-Humphries and Roper say their YouTube revenue is back, and they’re “thriving” on the platform now that everyone is stuck at home and streaming videos. They left the UK as soon as they could and traveled to Portugal where they own property and a barn, which they’ve focused on fixing up. This is the first time they’ve lived in a house in six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueQzug"&gt;“Owning the land where we are right now in Portugal was one of our best decisions because living in a van full-time, it’s all fine and well, but I always had that feeling that we never really belonged somewhere, like there was nowhere to fall back on,” says Gove-Humphries. “So having our own land where we can go, where we know that we’re not going to be moved on, or we know that we’re legally allowed to be here, is quite good. Even if you’re not here, it’s good for your mental health to know that you have got somewhere to fall back on, and this worked out brilliantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Tacj"&gt;Roper says multiple people they know, fellow vanlifers, looked into buying their own homes since the pandemic for this same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWmgdI"&gt;“It is quite scary when the whole world locks down, and you’ve got no way you’re allowed to be,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCCHVw"&gt;Still, they look forward to traveling again. Their original North America trip is still on the table, but they’re thinking it’ll happen in 2022 rather than next year, realistically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="zXbe0j"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195288/zoom-yoga-online-classes-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Katie Baki was teaching at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UKRPbM"&gt;Katie Baki almost immediately started hosting donation-based yoga classes on Zoom when the studios she worked at shut down in March. She appreciated being able to see students’ practice when their cameras were on and being able to record classes for later. She managed to set the mood by emailing her students Spotify playlists so they could recreate the yoga class ambiance in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7aqyb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How classes have been going since then&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbb31X"&gt;Baki now teaches four classes remotely a week for her own clients and two classes for a virtual studio. Her clients have stuck with her throughout the pandemic, which she greatly appreciates, but she says finding new students is “seemingly impossible” without the reach of in-person classes. Plus, she now competes directly with bigger studios that can afford to charge less than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="az6K03"&gt;“I don’t know if it’s sustainable, to be completely honest,” she says. “I’m sure that there are ways, but the teachers that I’ve spoken with, every yoga teacher is struggling. A lot of them only teach once a week, and a lot of students expect them to be free classes, and our industry got hit really, really hard, and it’s been challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiGThQ"&gt;Zoom classes have more or less acted like a Band-Aid on a large wound for Baki, and she’s ready to get back to in-person classes. She might continue teaching a couple remotely for viewers outside of her area, but otherwise, in-person classes are where she feels both she and the students get the most benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ysEUd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky, fashion influencer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MUzSxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21184344/coronavirus-covid-19-fashion-influencers-street-photography-instagram"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she was making fashion content at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Fdim"&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky’s fashion Instagram feed pivoted quickly when the pandemic took hold in the US. Instead of her usual glitzy looks and fun event photos, she posted herself with minimal makeup and her natural, wavy hair. She sang to her followers, who never knew she had a nice singing voice. She couldn’t rely on the same style or type of content she had been making previously, and couldn’t hire a photographer to help her take photos. At the same time, she had to strike the right tone and figure out what her followers wanted — they loved her luxurious, cool looks before, but would they still want that when they were all at home wearing sweatpants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TaRjjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s adjusted to the pandemic’s fashion trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yiq340"&gt;After months of being stuck at home, Savetsky says her followers seemingly want lighthearted, aspirational content again. She participated in her first professional photoshoots in around six months recently and says her followers crave a fantasy world where they could be dressing up and celebrating the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU1fEA"&gt;“People aren’t traveling,” she says. “People aren’t getting to do their normal holiday season glamorous gatherings and parties and all of that, and so to be able to give them a little bit of that on Instagram is, that’s kind of [my] angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOH4JD"&gt;That’s only the Instagram grid, however. Savetsky says throughout the pandemic she’s given her followers a peek into her real life, and they likely will want that to continue. The brands want that, too. Savetsky says the brand deals are coming back to her account but now involve more focus on her struggles and day-to-day life. Her followers are buying from her posts, too, she says, which she thinks reflects the lack of spending in other areas of their lives, like travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji5Him"&gt;“I feel like my audience really responds to this real factor. It’s nice to have the fantasy, but it’s not relatable, and people want to see your everyday life, especially when the world is hurting,” she says. “I think it’s kind of shown me that it’s not about the setting, or about the product, but it’s about me, and people wanting a window into my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is investigating data collection at YouTube, Facebook, and seven other companies</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjpNkX"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that it is launching a new inquiry into the privacy practices of some of the largest tech companies and social media platforms in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNNlYt"&gt;In a press release published Monday, the FTC announced that it is ordering nine social media and video streaming companies — including Amazon, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, Discord, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube — to provide data on how they collect and use personal information provided by their users. The companies have 45 days to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i8VQx"&gt;Each of the nine companies was contacted for comment. A Twitter spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge, “&lt;/em&gt;We’re working, as we always do, to ensure the FTC has the information it needs to understand how Twitter operates its services..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npGnAv"&gt;A Discord spokesperson said, “Discord takes user privacy very seriously and we look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions about our privacy practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gq6Xm"&gt;The FTC’s orders were authorized as part of a wide-ranging investigative inquiry and do not serve specific law enforcement purposes. However, the FTC could pursue enforcement actions should it find wrongful behavior throughout the study. In the agency’s Monday orders, the FTC requested that the companies provide information related to how they collect personal data, how that data determines which ads and content users are shown, and whether they “apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nul7Hu"&gt;The commission voted 4-1 to approve the orders with Commissioner Noah Phillips dissenting, saying that the probe was too wide-ranging to produce useful results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVKhwl"&gt;“These digital products may have launched with the simple goal of connecting people or fostering creativity. But, in the decades since, the industry model has shifted from supporting users’ activities to monetizing them,” three FTC commissioners who voted to approve the orders said in a joint statement Monday. “This transition has been fueled by the industry’s increasing intrusion into our private lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFJ99B"&gt;In February, the FTC used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2020/2/11/21133268/facebook-microsoft-apple-amazon-google-antitrust-review-joe-simons"&gt;this same investigative authority&lt;/a&gt; to request information on past acquisitions made by big tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Last week, the FTC sued Facebook to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unwind its acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of Instagram and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsLCCH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 12/14/20 at 5:10 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included statements from Twitter and Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first six minutes of Tenet now, from home, on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CkDiaBSErNGyJK-Y15kziZm3ps=/95x0:1112x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498986/Screen_Shot_2020_12_11_at_3.27.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pa5exA"&gt;Christopher Nolan recently went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;on a very public tirade&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of movies, including his, being seen on the big screen — but if anyone’s interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21330990/christopher-nolan-tenet-warner-bros-online-release-streaming-theaters"&gt;watching &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; opening prologue, they can do so now on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9n7h2"&gt;Warner Bros. has posted the film’s first six minutes on YouTube ahead of the movie’s digital release next week. Don’t worry about spoilers for the time-warping heist film, there aren’t any. (I saw &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;when it was released at a theater in suburban Canada; it was me and one other person at the other end of the theater.) The scene follows John David Washington’s Protagonist and a couple of other characters as they enter an auditorium to complete a mission. That’s really all you need to know. It’s a pretty fun, entirely Christopher Nolan segment that works on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2I7od"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;and Nolan&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have become part of the news cycle again following Nolan’s condemning of Warner Bros. for deciding to release all 17 of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;2021 films on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day they debut in theaters. As Nolan put it in a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” Since then, other directors including &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;Denis Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/judd-apatow-hbo-max-warner-bros-1234850713/"&gt;Judd Apatow&lt;/a&gt; have voiced their own displeasure with Warner Bros. decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzr7jn"&gt;In a year where theatrical movie releases all but ceased to exist, Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;was the last big blockbuster of 2020 — and it became a guidepost for other studios. Although the movie performed well internationally, amassing more than $300 million, it performed poorly in the United States, bringing in just $52 million. With coronavirus cases surging around the world, WarnerMedia decided to bet on growing its HBO Max service in the United States by pursuing a hybrid release format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNpRsd"&gt;If you missed &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;in theaters, and this six-minute prologue convinces you to check out Nolan’s movie, it’ll be available to purchase digitally and on Blu-ray &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551390/tenet-home-release-date-dvd-blu-ray-digital-nolan"&gt;on December 15th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsmU55"&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it will begin removing any content alleging widespread voter fraud influenced the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvfnVL"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the November 3rd election, YouTube came under fire for allowing channels to publish videos making false claims about election results. In one instance, One America News Network, a verified YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; declaring that “Trump won” the election. At the time, YouTube defended its decision to let the video stand, saying in a statement, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5dbuP"&gt;The company went on to say that content from “authoritative news organizations” were “the most popular videos about the election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXqZYU"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;Wednesday blog&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube said that its decision to begin removing misleading election videos follows the US’s safe harbor deadline and that “enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect.” Starting Wednesday, YouTube will begin removing any new content that misleads viewers about the outcome of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTLMS"&gt;YouTube’s announcement follows a series of lawsuits placed by the Donald Trump campaign challenging the results of the election. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected a request to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/supreme-court-republican-challenge-pennsylvania-vote.html"&gt;block certification&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania’s election results, making it nearly impossible for Republicans to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4kkjm"&gt;In the post, YouTube said its election information panels had surfaced over 200,000 election-related videos and were shown over 4.5 billion times. The company said that it would &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;update these panels&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, linking to electoral college results provided by the Office of the Federal Register calling Biden the official president-elect.&lt;/p&gt;
