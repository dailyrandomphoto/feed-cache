    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku calls out Google over YouTube contract stalemate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDXz5UnZzmDFuAoumDbn832oXIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025930/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R77EXb"&gt;Tensions between Roku and Google spilled over to customers in a new blog posted by the streaming service on Thursday. After months of failed negotiations for Roku to maintain the YouTube app, the company is accusing Google of anti-competitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIX9YD"&gt;Responding to the deadlocked negotiations, Google said that it would end all distribution of YouTube on new Roku devices after December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJq23"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Roku accused Google of making anti-competitive demands in carriage agreements, like requiring Roku to implement a dedicated YouTube search results row in the Roku interface. Roku also alleged that Google overrides music voice search and blocks relevant searches outside of YouTube’s own results while users are in the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLD5XS"&gt;“Doing business with an enterprise as powerful as Google creates complex challenges,” the blog post said. “Importantly, our concerns with Google are not about money. We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement. In fact, Roku does not earn a single dollar from YouTube’s ad supported video sharing service today, whereas Google makes hundreds of millions of dollars from the YouTube app on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZoqVB"&gt;Outside of these demands being hostile to consumers, Roku also alleged that Google’s requirements give it access to vast amounts of consumer data related to what Roku users watch on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLp2bb"&gt;Roku’s deal to distribute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;the YouTube TV app expired in April&lt;/a&gt; and the company removed the app from its store after failing to reach a new agreement with Google. Roku has consistently accused Google of making unfair demands while not requiring similar data-sharing and search features on other platforms like Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxugc"&gt;“Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYp5b"&gt;The blog comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bipartisan bill to combat anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt; behavior in the tech industry was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would ban similar behaviors alleged by Roku in its Thursday blog, like self-preferencing and discriminating against competitors’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2w4be"&gt;“Roku supports bipartisan efforts such as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to modernize our competition laws, promote innovation, and protect consumers in the Digital Age,” said John Kelly, Roku senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications at Roku in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/support-builds-for-bipartisan-legislation-from-klobuchar-grassley-and-colleagues-to-rein-in-big-tech"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBzllf"&gt;Roku told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday that company representatives were in contact with lawmakers over these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesJzu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/21/19 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wClyRx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGiguxru9rzApZKuJIVKuBLCoGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967245/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and YouTube will cut off ad money for climate change deniers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TFjnh6ir5kwdKu91SpykoqB3Ac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965820/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoHg1u"&gt;Google will no longer allow advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators to monetize content that denies the existence of climate change. The company detailed the changes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOxbM6"&gt;“Today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” the Google Ads team said in the document. “This includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3ybf"&gt;Google says it will use a mix of automated tools and human reviews to enforce the policy. “When evaluating content against this new policy, we’ll look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim,” Google said. Ads will still be allowed on climate topics like public debates on climate policy, research, and more, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWCsgW"&gt;The increased action against climate change deniers marks Google’s second big misinformation policy change in recent days, arriving about a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700171/youtube-vaccine-misinformation-antivax-ban"&gt;YouTube banned vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It follows new features announced by the search giant intended to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711623/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-footprint-maps-search-travel"&gt;shrink their carbon footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube cancels Rewind for good after years of everyone hating it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Will Smith in Rewind" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJbJjrli6W_ED6p4PlockymRPW0=/74x0:1370x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964471/Screen_Shot_2019_02_05_at_3.24.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2jX8n"&gt;YouTube Rewind — the company’s annual year-end round-up of trends, creators, memes, and the most popular videos on the site — has been canceled for good, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/10/07/youtube-no-longer-making-year-end-rewind-videos/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4eZN7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all the creators involved in Rewind - we’ll be   for your Rewinds as we refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube   with a different and updated kind of experience - stay tuned! → &lt;a href="https://t.co/kI69C24eL0"&gt;https://t.co/kI69C24eL0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube Creators (@YouTubeCreators) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeCreators/status/1446103025500577796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXGom"&gt;Instead, YouTube will “refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube [fire emoji] with a different and updated kind of experience,” although the company didn’t elaborate further on what it’ll be replacing Rewind with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeBa8l"&gt;YouTube will also be relying on creators on its platform to fill the gap, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll “continue to be inspiring to see the myriad of ways the most creative content producers in the world — our YouTube creators — encapsulate the end of year in their video recaps, as YouTube retires its own Rewind video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsiA"&gt;The news of YouTube canceling Rewind permanently isn’t a huge surprise. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1326947861305696263"&gt;already took off 2020&lt;/a&gt;, citing the difficulties of the year: “2020 has been different. And it doesn’t feel right to carry on as if it weren’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HCw9Sy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is canceling Rewind this year because 2020 has been too much ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562697/youtube-rewind-canceled-2020-pandemic-creators-community"},{"title":"PewDiePie makes his return to YouTube Rewind after two years of controversy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"},{"title":"YouTube Rewind 2018 is officially the most disliked video on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mInJcb"&gt;But Rewind had already been struggling long before the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;2018’s video&lt;/a&gt; was viciously panned by the YouTube community (to this day, it remains the most disliked video ever posted to the platform). Creators argued that the company was shifting focus from the “real community” — including controversial creators like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy"&gt;Logan Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095517/pewdiepie-t-series-youtube-fan-campaign-subscribers"&gt;PewDiePie&lt;/a&gt; — in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;more advertiser-friendly choices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u9LMp"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"&gt;2019’s video&lt;/a&gt; attempted to skirt controversy entirely by shifting its format from the big-budget mashup of YouTubers from years past to a more ordinary (and boring) list of clips of most-watched creators, videos, and trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s1yZV"&gt;But whether well-received or endlessly dunked on, Rewind videos have been a big part of YouTube’s culture for the past decade. Hopefully, whatever YouTube does end up doing to replace its big year-end celebration ends up a little less controversial going forward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal and YouTubeTV reach agreement to avoid dropped channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pkam8ki9vKonbOaWjIQxK5Od5G4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941898/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;After YouTube TV and NBCUniversal announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;a “short” extension&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to keep more than a dozen channels on the live TV service, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal say they have finalized a deal — meaning NBC-owned channels will stay put on YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfn9sz"&gt;“We’re thrilled to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying the full NBCUniversal portfolio of channels,” according to a Saturday &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;update to YouTube’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That means you won’t lose access to any of their channels, and YouTube TV will continue to offer 85+ networks for $64.99. We appreciate NBCUniversal’s willingness to work toward an agreement, and we also appreciate your patience as we negotiated with them on your behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imfEEA"&gt;With a deal reached just days after it looked as though the channels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;could get dropped&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV users will still have access to a dozen-plus channels that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;SYFY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;Plus, regional sports networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gauL3"&gt;NBC Sports Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPTSH"&gt;NBC Sports California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YwwI4q"&gt;NBC Sports Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3okHSr"&gt;NBC Sports Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGCh71"&gt;NBC Sports Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;YouTube TV had said that should the service lose the channels, it would have lowered its prices by $10 per month. But with a deal reached, the price will stay the same — and YouTube TV users will still be able to find their TV within one app without needing to subscribe elsewhere to get coverage from NBC-owned properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ah fuck: YouTube reinstates classic ‘I can’t believe you’ve done this’ meme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSJbf66JxNC5YwGRsrlZ-9sMhfE=/154x0:825x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924627/Screen_Shot_2021_09_29_at_10.19.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JP9Z5p"&gt;Whether it wants to be or not, YouTube is a guardian of internet history, with countless classic videos sitting in its archives. That makes it jarring when the company acts like what it is: a multinational corporation with no real understanding of this value. Case in point, this week, YouTube removed the original upload of the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;Ah fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this&lt;/a&gt;” meme, initially rejecting an appeal from its creator (and the guy who can’t believe this was done) and claiming that the clip violates the company’s “violent or graphic content policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADM4jv"&gt;In the words of &lt;a href="http://paulweedon.co.uk/"&gt;Paul Weedon&lt;/a&gt; himself, star of and uploader of the original video: Ah, fuck. “It’s completely out of the blue,” Weedon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; regarding the takedown. “I made the case that it’s been online going on 15 years and is basically part of internet culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGSbp7"&gt;Weedon &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1442952265552187394"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out the news of the takedown and his unsuccessful appeal, noting that the video had been on YouTube for 14 years and racked up 12 million views in that time with “no issues whatsoever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIdHJI"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKbU8B-QVZk"&gt;now the video is available again&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1443247423250444295"&gt;response tweet&lt;/a&gt; from its TeamYouTube account, the video hoster now says “this was a mistake on our end and your video is back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVy7jq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So this has happened. &lt;a href="https://t.co/O2baPp0ybq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O2baPp0ybq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Weedon (@Twotafkap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1442952265552187394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cypzMC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following up: this was a mistake on our end and your video is back up. We’re so sorry about the frustration this caused &amp;amp; have shared feedback with the team to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Look out for an email from us with more soon.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1443247423250444295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvPe6"&gt;The clip is a classic: low-res, contextless, and instantly funny. And, of course, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/O7lRV1VHv1g"&gt;countless re-uploads&lt;/a&gt; still exist (alongside the other, legitimately horrible content that YouTube is happy to leave up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYDRV4"&gt;The video has been &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;remixed and re-memed&lt;/a&gt; in countless ways since it first went viral in the mid-2010s, and Weedon himself has an interesting relationship with the content. In an &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnqj/my-life-as-a-meme-i-cant-believe-youve-done-this-revisited"&gt;article for &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, he describes how the clip was part of a series of “stunts” he and his friends filmed in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt; and how he sold the original rights for the video to the now-defunct &lt;a href="http://Break.com"&gt;Break.com&lt;/a&gt; and isn’t now sure who even owns the IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmVoXM"&gt;“At the time, going viral wasn’t really comparable to any other experience and it certainly wasn’t something I could discuss in solidarity with my friends,” writes Weedon. “All of a sudden you’re everywhere and it’s out of your control. You either try to fight it and get destroyed or embrace it and try to cash in. After yanking down several other videos on my YouTube channel, I opted for the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieeNQv"&gt;To add insult to injury, Weedon is currently exploring the possibility of making a documentary about the meme, so the takedown added a little twist to the proceedings. “This takes things in a completely different direction,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It says a lot about where YouTube is going. On Twitter, people seem to be saying the same thing: that this is a video that represents what YouTube used to be, and they’ve torched it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXLG9y"&gt;Weedon says he’s found all the footage from the day the meme was shot and that he and a group of friends are still exploring how to tell the story. “We’re still figuring out what we want to do with it,” he says. “Though, I definitely regret promising the documentary would be coming ‘soon’ in the teaser. I forgot how impatient people on the internet can be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube bans vaccine misinformation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwFvdJjRlIn8rwJqCXERzGNOQBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925721/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoXAgg"&gt;In a new attempt to stem the flow of anti-vaccine misinformation, YouTube said Wednesday that it &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123"&gt;won’t allow videos&lt;/a&gt; that claim vaccines approved by health authorities are dangerous or don’t work. The platform is also banning prominent anti-vaccine accounts, including Joseph Mercola’s channel and the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-linked Children’s Health Defense Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxHclE"&gt;YouTube pulled ads from anti-vaccination content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236839/youtube-demonetization-anti-vaccination-conspiracy-videos-dangerous-harmful-content"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and said in October 2020 that it would remove videos that pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. The new policy expands to block misinformation around other vaccines, including the flu shot, the HPV vaccine, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Videos that inaccurately claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism or that the flu shot causes infertility, for example, will not be allowed under the new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibtnR2"&gt;There are some exceptions: YouTube will still allow videos that include people sharing their personal experiences with vaccination. It’ll remove that content if the channels they’re on “demonstrate a pattern of promoting vaccine misinformation.” The guidelines say that the platform will also allow videos with information violating the policy if that video includes other context, like statements from medical experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmS7BT"&gt;Along with the new policy, YouTube is also terminating the channels of major anti-vaxxers, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those include Joseph Mercola, the Children’s Health Defense Fund, Erin Elizabeth, and Sherri Tenpenny. Channels for two other major figures, Rashid Bhuttar and Ty and Charlene Bollinger, were terminated a few months ago, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVYYO"&gt;Those anti-vaccine figures are all part of the “Disinformation Dozen,” a group identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes"&gt;responsible for the bulk&lt;/a&gt; of misleading claims about vaccines on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZZdql"&gt;YouTube expanded its vaccine policies after noting that misinformation around all vaccines could contribute to mistrust around the COVID-19 vaccine, Matt Halprin, YouTube’s vice president of global trust and safety, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/youtube-ban-joseph-mercola/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few months, the backlash to COVID-19 vaccinations has been expanding to target other vaccines: the Tennessee Department of Health temporarily suspended outreach around childhood vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;, and a Florida state senator &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/09/23/florida-gop-state-senator-reportedly-wants-to-review-non-covid-vaccine-mandates-for-schoolchildren/?sh=20057532545d"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he wants to “review” school vaccination requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlbn07"&gt;Facebook similarly expanded its vaccine misinformation policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272883/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-expanded-removal-autism"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; to block claims that the shots are dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afpaag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 30, 8:38AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article misidentified the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. linked fund as the Children’s Defense Fund. It is the Children’s Health Defense Fund. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music’s new Wear OS app is coming to older smartwatches after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scsn2o9zrSMFeCO3evBFGBk801w=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914927/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqxiAT"&gt;YouTube Music’s Wear OS app is rolling out to a handful of older Wear OS 2 smartwatches from the likes of Fossil, Michael Kors, and Mobvoi starting this week, after previously launching exclusively on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642047/google-youtube-music-wear-os-3-app-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;Samsung’s new Wear OS 3-powered Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The app lets YouTube Music Premium subscribers download songs to compatible smartwatches and listen to music offline without needing a paired phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZEED"&gt;The new app was first detailed when Google and Samsung announced they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging their Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to create Wear OS 3, and initial reports suggested it &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;wouldn’t be coming&lt;/a&gt; to devices running the older Wear OS 2 operating system. However, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621394/spotify-wear-os-2-app-offline-playback-smartwatch"&gt;Spotify’s offline support on Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, the new YouTube Music app will now be available for a broader selection of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y3vOsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Initial reports suggested it would be exclusive to new Wear OS 3 watches&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCvHZ"&gt;The app will be downloadable from the Google Play Store on compatible devices and supports Google’s Smart Downloads feature, which automatically refreshes the songs downloaded for local playback when connected to Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx6k83"&gt;Google says the app will be available this week for Fossil and Michael Kors’ Gen 6 lineup of smartwatches, as well as Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular / LTE, and TicWatch E3. More Wear OS 2 smartwatches are getting the app later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
