    <title>YouTube stars the Stokes Twins avoid jail after pleading guilty over fake bank robbery pranks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8TJmy"&gt;Alan and Alex Stokes, twin brothers who rose to fame on YouTube filming prank videos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor false imprisonment and reporting false emergencies in connection with a pair of now-removed videos they filmed in the fall of 2019 in which they pretended to have just robbed a bank. The 23-year-old brothers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356403/stokes-twins-youtube-felony-charge-bank-robbery-prank-video"&gt;charged in August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktdx8i"&gt;They faced a maximum of five years in prison if convicted on all counts, leading to the guilty plea in exchange for reduced sentences, according to a &lt;a href="http://orangecountyda.org/civica/press/display.asp?layout=15&amp;amp;Entry=6126"&gt;press release put out dated March 31st&lt;/a&gt; by the office of the district attorney of Orange County, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyIFUD"&gt;“The guilty pleas were in exchange for a judge reducing the felony false imprisonment charge to a misdemeanor. Prosecutors objected on the record and in a trial brief to the court’s offer to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor,” the press release states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8wzfnq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsuinD"&gt;Both received a sentence including 160 hours of community service and one year of probation in addition to both having to pay restitution. The Stokes brothers are also barred from returning to the University of California Irvine, where they filmed the prank videos, and they were also ordered not to produce any more videos “that mimic criminal behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECCuIT"&gt;The videos in question involved the Stokes brothers dressing in black garb with face masks filming themselves interacting with strangers, some of whom were distraught at the prospect of encountering what they believed were on-the-run criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isb0Rz"&gt;In one poorly thought-out situation filmed for the videos, the brothers called an Uber driver and demanded they be taken somewhere. The driver refused, but he was later questioned by law enforcement who initially approached the man with their guns drawn, mistakenly believing he was involved after numerous bystanders called law enforcement on the brothers for thinking they were attempting to carjack the driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGURr"&gt;The brothers pulled this prank twice in the same day on October 15th, 2019, choosing to film the second of the two videos at the University of California Irvine after already having been questioned and released by police elsewhere in Orange County earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQh71"&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. “An active bank robbery is not a casual police response and these police officers were literally risking their lives to help people they believed were in danger. It is irresponsible and reckless that these two individuals cared more about increasing their number of followers on the internet than the safety of those police officers or the safety of the innocent Uber driver who was ordered out of his car at gunpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6MEtV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StokesTwins/videos"&gt;Stokes Twins YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; remains active with more than 6.6 million subscribers. The most recent video, titled “FUNNY April Fool’s Pranks on Friends!,” was posted two days ago, and it’s already amassed 1.4 million views. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is relaxing some rules about ads on drug-related videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dY9SugOhPM8_9K-37U6fssO83fQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059189/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ds6gTM"&gt;From this month, Google is updating some of its YouTube ad guidelines about drug-related videos. In a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9725604?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/even-youtube-is-chilling-out-on-weed-1846594023?rev=1617228974804"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it’s “expanding monetization on educational, documentary or news content that may include violent interactions with law enforcement, recreational drugs and drug-related content, or sensitive events.” The update means more drug-related videos should be eligible to have ads placed next to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkRkDn"&gt;You can see the exact changes by comparing a backup of YouTube’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210324202410if_/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;old content guidelines from last month&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;guidelines that are live now&lt;/a&gt;. The guidelines break down drug-related content into three categories: videos where uploaders can turn ads on, videos where ads should be turned off, and videos where they can be turned on “but only brands who opt in will run ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9JYqm9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As New York becomes the sixteenth state to legalize use of marijuana&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jBfOCG"&gt;The biggest change is a new bullet point that’s appeared in the first section, covering videos where ads can be turned on. This now covers videos focusing “on the purchase, fabrication, or distribution of drugs, such as the fabrication of home-made opioids” and “news reports about cannabis farms” that do not glorify drug use. Previously, advertisers had to opt-in to run ads against this kind of content, restricting the amount of ad revenue they could make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bslg7s"&gt;There are also a couple of bullet points that have disappeared entirely from YouTube’s list of videos where ads have to be turned off altogether. These are videos “focusing on drug consumption (including its effects) without educational or documentary context,” or which contain “promotion of regulated legal drugs or substances that can induce a high (e.g. cannabis and derivatives THC and CBD).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ5S2"&gt;Although these exact descriptions haven’t been added to any of the other sections, YouTube has slightly amended the wording in its section describing opt-in advertiser content, which now covers “content focusing on the display or effects of drug consumption; or the creation or distribution of drugs or drug paraphernalia in a comedic, non-educational, or non-documentary context.” The exact status of content around legal highs is less clear, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk6SP"&gt;The individual changes are minor, but they should make it easier for YouTube creators to approach the topic of drugs in their videos without worrying about ad revenue. They reflect a broader acceptance of drugs in the United States that include New York recently becoming the sixteenth state to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360455/new-york-marijuana-legalization-conviction-expungement"&gt;legalize the recreational use of marijuana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has removed Steven Crowder from its Partner Program indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyFxfeZ2NIrOkeCWFoOrlI80dXY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051444/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.38.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G4rWQ"&gt;Two weeks ago, after YouTube revealed its definition of hate speech was so narrow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;that it couldn’t remove a wildly racist tirade&lt;/a&gt; for being wildly racist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;we wondered out loud&lt;/a&gt; what it would take for YouTube to stop promoting conservative commentator Steven Crowder as an official YouTube Partner and allowing him to profit from those tirades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pfv9P"&gt;Today, we have a partial answer: YouTube has officially suspended Steven Crowder’s main channel from the YouTube Partner Program indefinitely, which includes removing his ability to run ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p4gpN"&gt;It’s also banning him from uploading videos for a full week after his latest infraction: a now-removed video that reportedly challenged the legitimacy of the vote in Nevada. YouTube has a policy against false claims that the election was stolen. Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/steven-crowder/after-being-suspended-youtube-steven-crowder-announces-his-plan-evade-it-his-other"&gt;has already announced his intent&lt;/a&gt; to upload videos to his other Crowder Bits channel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzpvzm"&gt;Here’s YouTube’s statement (including links):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bac7lX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to monetize on YouTube, channels must comply with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Partner Program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which include our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/policies/#community-guidelines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google AdSense program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Channels that repeatedly violate our policies are suspended from the partner program. In addition, we removed a video from Steven Crowder’s channel for violating our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presidential election integrity policy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and applied a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning uploads are suspended for one week. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnnom"&gt;While YouTube isn’t telling us which straw broke the camel’s back when it comes to the YouTube Partner Program (and his ability to run ads), the company did point us towards two specific guidelines around &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Controversial_sensitive"&gt;controversial issues and sensitive events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Harmful_dangerous"&gt;harmful and dangerous acts&lt;/a&gt;. I would have guessed that awful, racist tirades would have already broken the YouTube Partner Program’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Hateful"&gt;hateful and derogatory content&lt;/a&gt; policy, but I guess I shouldn’t read too much into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzc9ck"&gt;It’s not the first time Crowder’s been removed from the YouTube Partner Program. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;,  it took him &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;just over a year to come back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nsbk4s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inexplicably, YouTube says extremely racist Steven Crowder video isn’t hate speech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"},{"title":"YouTube will let Steven Crowder run ads after year-long suspension for harassment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"},{"title":"Carlos Maza is back on YouTube and ready to fight   ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/31/21112724/carlos-maza-steven-crowder-vox-youtube-harassment-policies-breadtube"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube is experimenting with hiding dislikes to protect creators’ well-being</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s4RirOX9iMkRcEc-0mNwnWO-Hc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051226/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXNup"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s experimenting with hiding dislikes to discourage “dislike mobs” from deliberately downvoting videos from creators and channels. The experiment is a different implementation than the solutions the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;, but it is similar to other attempts platforms like Instagram have taken to nip targeted attacks in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuDtVC"&gt;In the current setup, stats for both likes and dislikes are viewable in a creator’s individual &lt;a href="http://studio.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube Studio&lt;/a&gt; page, but only likes will be displayed publicly on a video. In &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en"&gt;a support article&lt;/a&gt; explaining the test, YouTube says that dislikes can negatively impact a creator’s well-being and “may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video.” Basically, the idea is that seeing a dislike number and watching it go up could be enough motivation to join in and make the number larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ngXt4J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;   In response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike campaigns, we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks (example below!). &lt;a href="https://t.co/aemrIcnrbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aemrIcnrbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube (@YouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shLUNG"&gt;Creators rely on likes and dislikes as a form of feedback to guide their creative output, but much like purposefully giving a game a bad review on Steam, it’s easy to turn what could be a useful feature into another surface for abuse. When YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEdlaJo5YV8"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; it was looking into addressing problems with dislikes, it was considering three ideas: hiding the numbers for both likes and dislikes, adding more friction to disliking something through requiring extra interaction, or removing likes and dislikes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUsbYC"&gt;This test does half of what the first option promised, and it makes a certain amount of sense. If dislike numbers are the problem, why not just hide them and see what happens? Instagram experimented with a similar kind of test when it decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20956091/instagram-testing-hiding-likes-us-bullying-mosseri"&gt;to hide likes on posts&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, likes are inherently positive, but chasing a high like count can have its own negative impact on creators whose livelihoods depend on closely monitoring interactions with their posts and appearing well-liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmd8t8"&gt;YouTube isn’t testing hiding dislikes on all creators’ videos, but if you notice them on your page or you have an opinion as a viewer, &lt;a href="http://yt.be/help/feedback"&gt;YouTube is collecting feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube denies employee request to remove rap song with anti-Chinese lyrics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGczVJldUO-M8w3RSFlobXcCW5I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050807/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfs8IO"&gt;YouTube is facing employee calls to remove a rap song that allegedly encourages violence against Asians, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/youtube-refuses-to-remove-anti-asian-song-drawing-staff-ire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcEwIU"&gt;Rapper YG’s “Meet the Flockers” is a detailed description of a burglary — a relatively common trope in rap music — but it opens with a specific reference to Chinese communities: “find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don’t believe in bank accounts.” In light of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22274325/asians-racism-coronavirus-oakland-san-francisco"&gt;recent rise in street violence against Asians&lt;/a&gt;, a group of YouTube employees argued that message was straightforwardly dangerous, ultimately asking the Trust &amp;amp; Safety team to remove the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBEA0v"&gt;But YouTube ultimately declined to remove the song, citing &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;the platform’s exception&lt;/a&gt; for “educational, documentary, scientific, and artistic” (or EDSA) content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGerpX"&gt;“While EDSA is not a free pass for any content, there are likely thousands of music videos that would otherwise violate policies... were it not for these sorts of EDSA exceptions,” executives wrote in an open letter to employees. “Removing this video would have far-reaching implications for other musical content containing similarly violent or offensive lyrics, in genres ranging from rap to rock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqbIY1"&gt;It’s not the first time “Meet the Flockers” has generated controversy. Largely ignored on its release in 2014, the song became &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/yg-meet-the-flockers-controversy"&gt;a point of controversy for Chinese communities two years later&lt;/a&gt; after circulating in social media channels, with &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/yg-meet-the-flockers-knock-burglaries/1958131/"&gt;some police departments&lt;/a&gt; even blaming the song and a subsequent unauthorized music video for specific home burglaries. Concern became so heated that &lt;a href="http://sfist.com/2016/09/28/jane_kim_wants_youtube_to_remove_an.php"&gt;San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim&lt;/a&gt; called on YouTube to remove the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxa5wi"&gt;YouTube also declined to take action in response to the 2016 controversy, although the uploader later voluntarily removed the music video. The song remains on YouTube through the official YG account, played over a static album cover image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8gcMQ"&gt;Reached for comment, YouTube emphasized the importance of open disagreement within its workforce. “YouTube has an open culture and employees are encouraged to to share their views, even when they disagree with a decision,” a representative said. “We’ll continue this dialogue as part of our ongoing work to balance openness with protecting the YouTube community at large.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcyPeq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is already shutting down its live TV service, partners with YouTube TV and Philo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkjNGeYXyH83iWeu69Bj9WlB2G4=/179x0:2249x1380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044385/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_3.19.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzT0Ue"&gt;Only five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535264/tmobile-tvision-live-internet-tv-streaming-service-price"&gt;announcing its TVision streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile today shared news that TVision’s three bundles of live channels will all shut down at the end of April. The development comes as part of T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22120959"&gt;new partnership with Google and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s making out to be a huge deal. The carrier says YouTube TV will now fill the role of its “live TV solution.” It’s also positioning Philo TV as the replacement for its base offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6Up7y"&gt;The Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services that were available with TVision will go dark on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWpsbg"&gt;T-Mobile is giving a free month of YouTube TV to customers who had signed up for one of the TVision Live packages, and all T-Mobile subscribers will be eligible to save $10 on the usual monthly rate of $64.99; so if they want the service, it’ll cost $54.99 per month. They can also get three free months of YouTube Premium. On Philo’s side, customers can also get $10 off the usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VIIhE"&gt;“YouTube TV is a leader in this space,” T-Mobile said in today’s press release. “It offers the same great flexibility, robust content and convenience that TVision customers love.” The message is clear: T-Mobile is teaming up with a company that has been in this game longer and is already familiar with everything it takes to make streaming, watch-anywhere TV work — even if it feels like the costs keep climbing higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkan9Q"&gt;In what comes off as an attempt to sugarcoat a short-lived misstep, T-Mobile says its “TVision initiative was launched to give customers new choices and help millions cut the cord, while expanding appeal for the company’s forthcoming wireless home Internet service.” That doesn’t quite match the usual brazen “Uncarrier” tone that &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027005931/en/"&gt;T-Mobile had back in October&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO Mike Sievert said “just like we changed wireless for good, now we’re gonna change TV for good.” At the time, T-Mobile said TVision Live was “a total game-changer for anyone who wants live news and sports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYIAnX"&gt;Sievert has now changed his tune. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fturns-out-tv-is-better-with-friends&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, he acknowledged that TV is better “with friends,” and went into more detail on what led to T-Mobile’s revamped approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4znjJL"&gt;This shift may surprise some given last year’s TVision streaming services launch. But innovation seldom follows a straight line. Since launching the TVision initiative, we’ve learned a lot about the TV industry, about streaming products, and of course, about TV customers. We also saw trends that made us take a fresh look at how to best do in video what we always do: put customers first. With our TV software provider encountering some financial challenges and with our broader, strategic partnerships with Google and Philo, we saw an opportunity to deliver unique value to our customers and strengthen the TVision initiative with the best partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VKXEW"&gt;This industry is incredibly fragmented, with new streaming services launching all the time, and we’ve concluded that we can add even more value to consumers’ TV choices by partnering with the best services out there, negotiating incredible streaming media deals for T-Mobile customers, and helping our customers navigate the increasingly complex streaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8PqJk"&gt;Sievert describes the new arrangement as “a big upgrade,” adding that “YouTube TV offers more than twice as many channels as TVision Live, and Philo offers nearly twice as many channels as TVision Vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCCJ3h"&gt;TVision Live had started at $40 / month, with Live Plus and Live Zone each increasing by another $10. As other internet TV providers know, it’s unlikely that T-Mobile would’ve been able to hang on to those lower tiers for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeLpTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fvibe&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Vibe&lt;/a&gt; — a $10-per-month service that provides on-demand access (but not live streams) to shows from AMC, Discovery, MTV, and other networks — is also being phased out. Same goes for TVision Channels, which lets customers aggregate their subscriptions from Showtime, Stars, and Epix. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub 4K streaming dongle&lt;/a&gt; will remain available, and it sounds like YouTube TV will now get a prominent spot on that device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51iACF"&gt;You can look at this as a retreat on T-Mobile’s part, but I think its decision is probably the right one. YouTube TV remains the streaming TV service to beat, and there just wasn’t enough about TVision to make it stand out among YTTV and other competitors. Any price advantage was never going to last. Above all else, T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;still touting its strong 5G network advantage&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max data plan&lt;/a&gt; it announced in late February. The plan is the only one among major carriers to lift any deprioritization limits on data usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAubD5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 29th, 4:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article has been updated with more details on T-Mobile’s revamped TV approach, with new details on Philo’s role in the initiative and a blog post from T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube demonetizes David Dobrik’s channels over Vlog Squad sexual assault allegations  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2021 - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Eq-8Dsxzb54lspK9fpO5PmhzDc=/0x0:4485x2990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029317/1306933980.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgDDdk"&gt;YouTube has temporarily demonetized multiple David Dobrik channels after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-demonetizing-david-dobrik-following-vlog-squad-scandal-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of Dobrik’s channels have been demonetized; David Dobrik, David Dobrik Too, and the channel for his video podcast, Views. As well as Dobrik’s channels, YouTube has also demonetized Durte Dom, the personal channel of the ex-Vlog Squad member at the center of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfElQl"&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “We have temporarily suspended monetization on David Dobrik and Durte Dom channels for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgEN1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47Y84t"&gt;The video platform is the latest organization to take action against Dobrik after the allegations emerged in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. In it, a woman featured in a 2018 vlog said that the former Vlog Squad member engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. Footage from the night of the incident was later published in a since-removed YouTube video titled  “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyb00"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB734hc89x8"&gt;most recent video&lt;/a&gt; addressing the controversy, Dobrik apologized for his role in the incident. “I want to apologize to her and her friends for ever putting them in an environment that I enabled that made them feel like their safety and values were compromised. I’m so sorry.” Dobrik also confirmed he took the decision to stop filming with the former Vlog Squad member in 2019. “I fully believe the woman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sycRhp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2021/3/23/22346231/david-dobrik-advertisers-assault-allegations-old-videos"&gt;More than a dozen advertisers&lt;/a&gt; have cut ties with Dobrik after the report emerged, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook. Dobrik has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;parted ways with disposable camera app Dispo&lt;/a&gt;, an app he co-founded in 2019, in light of the allegations. The app has lost investors including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373855197831720963%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22344171%2Fdavid-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;Spark Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/david-dobriks-dispo-loses-another-investor-the-ceo-of-lime-2021-3?r=ts-sub"&gt;Lime CEO Wayne Ting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MrBeast working with $2 million fund to invest in up-and-coming creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of MrBeast." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1ZDD8zOsJrPZAKr-sL59N6Ouxw=/88x0:1140x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020695/18.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson. | Photo: Night Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wow8GJ"&gt;MrBeast said last year that he wanted a way to invest in up-and-coming creators, help them blow up, and get a cut of their business in return — and today, he’s announcing a plan to do just about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLNV5"&gt;The hit YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is working with a $2 million investment fund that will offer creators up to $250,000 in exchange for a stake in their channels. The fund, called Juice Funds, is part of a new company that Donaldson is a minority owner of called &lt;a href="https://getjuice.com/"&gt;Creative Juice&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance"&gt;announced this afternoon in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTyauU"&gt;“We’re gonna make sure we find [creators] that actually need a giant cash inflow and aren’t just trying to go buy a Lamborghini,” Donaldson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJcttY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Juice is going to change so much you guys don’t even understand. Genuinely excited :)&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1374806609604583429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iRvj4"&gt;Details about the investment fund are limited right now. Juice Funds hasn’t said when it will launch or what type of creators it’s looking to invest in. Donaldson said the idea is to help YouTubers “pour gas on the fire” the way a business might by raising an influx of cash once they’re already growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuIcB"&gt;MrBeast is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20924718/mrbeast-youtube-stunts-challenges-money-philanthropy-creators-morgz"&gt;one of the biggest creators on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He has nearly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/videos"&gt;56 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and gets tens of millions of views per video (his most recent, posted a week ago, already has 35 million views). He’s known for pulling off goofy, supersized stunts — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwy_rKc7gI"&gt;like making a “2,000 gallon” cereal bowl&lt;/a&gt; — but mainly, he’s known for giving away cars, houses, and cash as part of his videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QENCYp"&gt;The investment fund is just one part of what Creative Juice plans to offer. The company is developing tools to help creators track their performance across platforms. Investors are calling it “Square for creators” and say it plans to launch a suite of products to help creators operate more like small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYHz5t"&gt;While Creative Juice’s website says that “MrBeast will invest up to $2M” in YouTube creators, the reality is that he’s just one part of Juice Funds. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the $2 million comes from Creative Juice, not Donaldson, and that Donaldson will not be the only person picking out creators. “He will be involved in selecting and mentoring creators,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And while Donaldson will “share upside in creators” for his role in Juice Funds, it’ll be Creative Juice that directly owns the stake in these creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0eClvs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like when I see a channel that I think will blow up, I wish I could just like buy shares in it or something lol&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1333861470216609794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLGZ21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 25th, 2PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to clarify MrBeast’s role in Juice Funds. While Creative Juice initially indicated that he was overseeing the $2 million fund, the company has since clarified that he is an adviser to the company who will be involved in choosing investments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t remove a three-hour live-streamed video of the mass shooting in Boulder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gunman Opens Fires At Grocery Store In Boulder, Colorado" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dq5pQuyEwPAIJYc9e7BfBs2G5w=/0x0:3143x2095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012697/1231881876.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chet Strange / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEykZ"&gt;YouTube says the platform will not remove a controversial live-streamed video of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, despite criticism of the streamer’s tactics and commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBbeEq"&gt;“Following yesterday’s tragic shooting, bystander video of the incident was detected by our teams. While violent content intended to shock or disgust viewers is not allowed on YouTube, we do allow videos with enough news or documentary context,” YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We applied an age restriction to the content and will continue to monitor the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uemb1r"&gt;The live stream was broadcast from around the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8vn9/boulder-shooting-livestream-not-being-pulled-by-youtube"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it reached a live audience that peaked at around 30,000 people and has since been viewed around 585,000 times. The streamer, Dean Schiller, began recording inside the supermarket soon after the attack. He continued recording from outside for more than three hours, despite police requests for him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qxCUih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video has been viewed around half a million times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bM2SOR"&gt;Schiller has identified himself in the past as a citizen journalist, and in 2019, he and another videographer were &lt;a href="https://www.westword.com/news/citizen-journalists-discuss-lawsuit-against-boulder-cops-11381112"&gt;arrested and jailed for filming&lt;/a&gt; around the Boulder County Jail, following a series of videos that captured alleged police misconduct. But as &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; notes, Schiller has been criticized on several fronts for the shooting video. Some video commenters called him out for not dialing 911 or attempting to help people fleeing the building, while some &lt;a href="https://gazette.com/news/local/man-who-live-streamed-shooting-scene-at-king-soopers-well-known-to-boulder-cops/article_9d43b086-8b6a-11eb-9987-6f7ca1b5bb4c.html"&gt;other news outlets&lt;/a&gt; and anti-extremism researchers criticized him for speculating on the shooter’s motives, revealing police tactics, and briefly filming the bodies of victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5AAH"&gt;Yesterday’s shooting in Boulder left 10 people dead, and a police spokesperson &lt;a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/23/king-soopers-shooting-ahmad-al-issa-suspected-killing-10/"&gt;said the alleged killer&lt;/a&gt; was taken into custody after being shot in the leg by a police officer. Police have not offered a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTiS9"&gt;Videos of murder have created a quandary for social network moderators who are tasked with distinguishing between meaningful journalism and content that could inspire copycat attacks or play into a killer’s search for publicity. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have scrambled to remove video directly recorded by mass shooters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;including a 2019 attack&lt;/a&gt; on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. But they’ve also been criticized for &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/facebook-blames-technical-glitch-for-temporary-removal-of-falcon-heights-shooting-video/"&gt;removing video&lt;/a&gt; documenting newsworthy events like police shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2OGScb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mass shooting videos can amplify an attack’s harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWTfPh"&gt;Platforms have also responded by surfacing trusted news outlets or by limiting the reach of controversial posts, even if they’re not banned outright. But YouTube didn’t outline any specific steps it had taken on Schiller’s video beyond requiring users to log in and verify their age before viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfILwP"&gt;The video also plays into long-standing questions about how journalists should responsibly cover violence. While some YouTube comments called the video a negative byproduct of social media reporting, others drew parallels with sensationalist coverage in older mediums like TV news — comparing Schiller to the protagonist of the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbjLdF"&gt;Traditional media outlets have gradually reevaluated their playbook for reporting on mass shootings in recent years. That includes trying to avoid an inordinate focus on the shooter or unsubstantiated speculation about their motives, particularly in the early stages of an incident, when very little is known about the attack. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reportingonmassshootings.org/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; also include avoiding graphic violence that’s posted without a clear purpose — and could add to the trauma of people who have survived the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRKu1K"&gt;David Dobrik has lost more than a dozen advertisers and 300,000 YouTube subscribers over the past week after &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; detailed a rape allegation against a former member of his vlogging crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KW8egY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brands-no-longer-working-with-youtube-star-david-dobrik-list-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 11 brands, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook say they are no longer working with him. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1374204205754384390"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PopCrave &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Chipotle, which recently named a burrito after Dobrik, has dropped him. And &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/03/22/david-dobrik-seatgeek-hellofresh-sponsors-drop-vlog-squad-assault-allegations/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TubeFilter &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that SeatGeek — previously one of Dobrik’s biggest advertisers, having sponsored a number of videos in which he gives away cars to friends and family — also says it does not have plans to work with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkYmab"&gt;Advertisers are fleeing Dobrik’s channel following &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing a rape allegation against Dom Zeglaitis, better known as Durte Dom. Zeglaitis, a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad, is accused of raping a woman in the course of filming a video for Dobrik’s YouTube channel in 2018. Portions of the encounter were posted to YouTube and later taken down at the woman’s request. Dobrik said in a video posted early this morning that he stopped filming with Zeglaitis in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WTD9Y5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB734hc89x8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="npqW7y"&gt;The report followed another allegation of sexual assault by a former member of the Vlog Squad. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that Joseth “Seth” Francois said he was tricked into kissing someone as part of a “prank” video for Dobrik’s channel in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWchOI"&gt;Like many major YouTubers whose popularity exploded in the mid-to-late 2010s, Dobrik’s channel grew in part thanks to edgy videos that often involved salacious plotlines and immature pranks. As these creators have gained a bigger stage, those videos and other past behaviors have come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6v55n"&gt;Last June, several YouTubers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21306858/shane-dawson-jenna-marbles-youtube-blackface-racism-content"&gt;addressed old racist videos&lt;/a&gt; as fans demanded accountability during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308288/shane-dawson-youtube-suspends-monetization-channels-blackface-older-videos"&gt;suspended ads on Shane Dawson’s channel&lt;/a&gt; over old racist videos, Target stopped carrying his book, and the makeup company Morphe dropped his products. Jenna Marbles stepped away from YouTube as part of an apology over past racist videos. And Dobrik also issued an apology for filming racist videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noqUnH"&gt;Dobrik has faced growing consequences as the result of these latest reports. In addition to advertisers fleeing his channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;he’s parted ways&lt;/a&gt; with the hot new camera app Dispo, which he co-founded, and he’s &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/david-dobrik-angel-city-football-club-2021-3"&gt;no longer a co-owner&lt;/a&gt; of the Angel City Football Club, a US women’s soccer team co-owned by a number of celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npeE6h"&gt;There are still 18 million people subscribed to Dobrik’s YouTube channel alone, so it’s not as though his audience is gone. But sponsors are a big part of the way that top YouTubers earn money, since it insulates them from the uncertainties of YouTube’s built-in advertising system. YouTube doesn’t appear to have taken action against Dobrik’s channel. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1il5m"&gt;In his video this morning, Dobrik said he’ll be taking a short break from YouTube so he can add “infrastructure” to support his channel. That includes bringing on an HR person so people can “communicate discomfort in a way that’s comfortable to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
