    <title>The Google union just passed 700 members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHFMNM"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) passed 700 members on Monday, growing from roughly 230 at launch on January 4th. The group, which is open to employees and contractors at Google’s parent company, includes workers from 35 offices in the US and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Tu1J9"&gt;AWU organized in secret for almost a year, before &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/opinion/google-union.html"&gt;going public with an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The news prompted an outpouring of support from tech workers in Silicon Valley. “We were excited to see the response of the public and employees,” says Alan Morales, a Google engineer. “Now we’re welcoming all of our new members and hearing their motivations for joining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euzc3k"&gt;As a minority union, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22213494/google-union-alphabet-workers-tech-organizing-activism-labor"&gt;AWU can’t force Google management to come to the table to negotiate&lt;/a&gt;. But it can try to pressure executives by rallying members toward a cause. That’s exactly what happened last week, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;AWU called on YouTube to permanently ban Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4mjA8"&gt;“YouTube refuses to hold Donald Trump accountable to the platform’s own rules by choosing only to remove one video instead of removing him from the platform entirely,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1347331587315171330/photo/1"&gt;they wrote&lt;/a&gt;. The company “is avoiding the proactive action called for by both their workers and the broader public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3VjkV"&gt;The union categorized the letter as a public statement. So far, it hasn’t put out a list of demands, as it wants to hear from new members before settling on major initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJVQPQ"&gt;As of this morning, YouTube hasn’t changed its stance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrGa07"&gt;California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a former labor organizer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that AWU’s minority union structure could provide a template for workers at other tech companies. “I’m excited that it’s a little bit different,” she says. “One of the challenges we’ve faced in organizing the tech sector is that it might not be achievable in the standard National Labor Relations Board format.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLwSMg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Platforms take action against Trump after Capitol mob attack</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Keep up with all the developments here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8zuTUk"&gt;Online platforms have taken action against President Donald Trump in response to his encouragement of a pro-Trump mob that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th. That day, Facebook and Twitter removed some of Trump’s social media posts, a video, and instituted short-term bans on Trump’s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngqRae"&gt;But on January 7th, platforms began taking more drastic action, with Facebook deciding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;ban Trump&lt;/a&gt; “indefinitely,” and Shopify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;taking down Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt; (which sold Make America Great Again hats). More actions may follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z56WHr"&gt;We’ll be following the situation closely, and you can keep up with all of the developments right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says it will punish Trump and other channels that continue to spread election lies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Addresses Protesters In D.C. Via Video Statement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHrNqlSqjuRanr5ROEIqCTNbt5A=/0x1:5636x3758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633170/1230456036.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfS9fz"&gt;YouTube will temporarily restrict channels that post videos containing widespread misinformation about 2020 election results — including the channel of President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66dVUc"&gt;Instead of simply removing videos that spread misinformation, any channel that post videos with false claims about the election will now receive a strike, temporarily preventing them from uploading videos. This includes Trump’s channel. Channels that earn one strike are restricted from &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;posting for one week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXcjyh"&gt;In December, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan"&gt;issued a new policy&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any content designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. Since then, the company has removed thousands of videos, according to a company spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGZkN"&gt;Prior to yesterday’s events, a grace period was in place allowing YouTube to remove videos without applying strikes to channels. This often happens when YouTube institutes new policies, and it’s designed as an effort to be fair to creators while they adjust to the new rules. The grace period was set to expire on January 21st, following Inauguration Day, according to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ln7kLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prior to yesterday, YouTube was removing videos without applying strikes to channels as a temporary measure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MknGIJ"&gt;YouTube’s teams made the decision following “the extraordinary events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have been certified&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;according to a YouTube spokesperson. The company removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, any channel that receives three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated in accordance with YouTube policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3XW1v"&gt;This means that channels spreading misinformation about the election results will see strikes applied to their channels if they continue. For example, channels like OANN, a right-wing news organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;that has perpetuated statements&lt;/a&gt; made by the president that he won the election, could receive a strike on top of having videos deleted if it were to continue uploading similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bogF"&gt;Over the last 24 hours, several companies have taken stricter stances against the president’s content. Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to ban the president outright if he posted another tweet violating the company’s policies or inciting violence. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bf4f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th, 3:07pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story was updated to include details about how long the suspension lasts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKrBBH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Zq9fM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;As rioters attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Facebook removed a video from President Donald Trump responding to the violence. The decision came around an hour after the video was posted on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKxwZE"&gt;“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” said Guy Rosen, Facebook vice president of integrity, in a tweet Wednesday. “We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UaLv6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Rosen (@guyro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RKGut"&gt;In Trump’s video, he responded to the mob violence descending on the US Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the minute-long clip, Trump called on rioters to peacefully “go home” hours after the initial invasion began. He also made false claims that the most recent US election results were fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4gmSh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely in the video. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnyGq8"&gt;Less than an hour later, Facebook also removed a text post from Trump, which sought to justify the attack, telling supporters to “remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FdcDUK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="7aSiE7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="li1aEt"&gt;Facebook placed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;a handful of labels&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s video before finally deciding to remove it altogether. These previous labels focused on debunking Trump’s claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;also removed&lt;/a&gt; the video, saying in a tweet, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvLubB"&gt;In a blog &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/"&gt;posted Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook also said that it is searching for and removing content that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4HInwK"&gt;Praise and support of the storming of the US Capitol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvGAOa"&gt;Calls to bring weapons to locations across the US — not just in Washington but anywhere in the US — including protests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMApWV"&gt;Incitement or encouragement of the events at the Capitol, including videos and photos from the protestors. At this point they represent promotion of criminal activity which violates our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWARrK"&gt;Calls for protests — even peaceful ones — if they violate the curfew in DC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyl9R"&gt;Attempts to restage violence tomorrow or in the coming days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s67CI5"&gt;The company says it is also implementing new emergency measures, including using AI to demote content that “likely violates our policies” and automatically shutting off comments on posts in groups that “start to have a high rate of hate speech or content that incites violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7T6VR"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg also reportedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1346974086967173120"&gt;sent a memo&lt;/a&gt; to employees, calling Wednesday’s events “a dark moment in our nation’s history.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1K7Ze7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Zuckerberg just sent out an internal post/memo to employees. here's the Text below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TYvgvvaJIg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TYvgvvaJIg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— rat king (@MikeIsaac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1346974086967173120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dc21wg"&gt;Twitter first restricted and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;removed Trump’s video&lt;/a&gt;, citing a “risk of violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9ZS0H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 7:26 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFxMofaXSlSA_kPoXhAwV1xBcCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630050/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cvaxy5"&gt;YouTube has removed a video from President Donald Trump addressing a mob attack on the Capitol today because the president repeats false information about the outcome of the 2020 election, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfsjzd"&gt;The company will allow Trump’s message to appear in other creators’ videos if there is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;proper educational or news context&lt;/a&gt;; basically, if people are talking about Trump’s message as part of a greater point, YouTube will allow it to remain up. The removal comes after YouTube instituted a new policy update in December 2020 that forbids any type of content that alleges widespread voter fraud impacted the results of the 2020 presidential election. In Trump’s new video, which was also posted to Twitter and Facebook, he continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVcayh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9FRq"&gt;He also used the video to call on rioters to “go home” following hours of the attack. Trump did not denounce any violence that occurred today. Twitter initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;placed restrictions on his video&lt;/a&gt;, preventing people from liking, retweeting, or replying to Trump’s original post. Twitter cited “risks of violence” as the reason. Some time later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;Twitter fully removed the video and two other tweets&lt;/a&gt;, saying they violated its rules. Trump’s post on Facebook initially received a label saying, “The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the integrity of our elections,” but it has since removed it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajAMsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfUBcb"&gt;YouTube’s move comes after the company faced criticism over the way it handled misinformation appearing on its platform the day of the election. At the time, YouTube defended leaving up a number of videos from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;outlets like OANN and individual creators&lt;/a&gt; that  flocked to the site to spread misinformation about fraudulent results. Videos with titles like “Trump Won. MSM hopes you don’t believe your eyes” were allowed to remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zx5nHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="bNUZcS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mJUZpC"&gt;“Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way,” YouTube wrote on Twitter at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKCxjJ"&gt;Since then, YouTube has reevaluated its policies. Today, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;people live-streamed the attack on Capitol and posted videos&lt;/a&gt;, the moderation teams are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That didn’t stop a few channels from using the attack to monetize their own live streams. YouTube has not said if it will revoke those payments if the streams are found to violate the company’s guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRh3FF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter also eventually pulled the video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube are handling live streams of the Capitol mob attack</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udDCN2"&gt;A mob of President Donald Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the US Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, and the event was live-streamed. On YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and more, you could get a view of protesters gathered outside — and eventually &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; — of the US Capitol. In some cases, the streams were monetized through tipping features. In others, streamers encouraged viewers to donate to accounts on Patreon or GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHONTI"&gt;The event presented a sudden and serious moderation challenge for YouTube and other platforms, particularly ones that allowed live streams. YouTube, Facebook, and other social media networks prepared for the 2020 elections in November by setting up policies around labeling and banning misinformation and calls for violence. As protests started this afternoon in Washington, DC, however, the platforms were once again asked to assess whether comments on and coverage of the protests were violating their policies in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRpI8s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8fG8M"&gt;On YouTube, live streams of the mob illegally occupying the Capitol could be found by searching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF2OTDQHxu0"&gt;“Stop the Steal”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EZow4d1Ys"&gt;“Patriot Capitol’.’&lt;/a&gt; While the platform surfaced authoritative feeds from various news sources, including ABC and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, it wasn’t difficult to find pro-coup channels that were carrying feeds from a variety of other platforms, including Facebook and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNkfV0"&gt;Within those more radical YouTube feeds, chat rooms reacted live to what they were seeing. Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA.” Others expressed bewilderment over the images playing out in the Capitol as people climbed walls, pushed their way through the police presence, and tried to break down doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSRt5O"&gt;Some streams asked for donations — which were made outside of YouTube, on platforms like PayPal. Monetization features like super chat and super stickers were seen on a couple of live streams viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and a reporter saw ads playing on an RT live stream.  YouTube’s rules say that videos and live streams must adhere to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/#community-guidelines"&gt;site’s community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in order to be monetized, and they state that videos inciting or encouraging violence and showing violent imagery are not allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuyVCfPBilG6UMlD1FeBxRst0-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218237/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_3.43.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the “Super Chat” tips sent into a live stream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdxh3W"&gt;Teams at YouTube are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” according to a spokesperson. Since the attack began, the site’s moderators have removed multiple streams that actively incite or encourage violence or show people carrying firearms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAg8S8"&gt;YouTube does allow certain videos to remain up if they have proper news context, but that’s often judged on a case-by-case basis. On a number of videos that contain terms like “Stop the Steal” or “Patriots Capitol” in the title, YouTube has also included an information box that states “the electoral college has confirmed Joe Biden as president-elect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsa6rX"&gt;“We will remain vigilant in the coming hours,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVqPZ2"&gt;Outside of live streams, YouTube seemed to surface content from authoritative sources, like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and NBC. However, searching YouTube for “Stop the Steal” streams using Google Chrome’s Incognito mode highlighted videos from RT and channels with names like “Agentsix1,” “The Truth,” and “Real News Live.” YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992018/youtube-borderline-content-recommendation-algorithm-news-authoritative-sources"&gt;changed its search algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to try to prevent this kind of borderline content — videos that aren’t prohibited, but contain disturbing or harmful subject matter — from surfacing as top results on the platform. It is unclear how effective that measure is in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlS3k"&gt;Coverage of the event was harder to find on Twitch. Though the site is built around live video, its search features make it somewhat difficult to find live coverage of political events, so users largely have to browse through the site’s categories to find relevant live broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCygnh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch commenters responded in astonishment at what they were seeing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eTdnRP"&gt;Most streams on Twitch were from people commenting from afar. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch the streamer HayliNic talk about what she was seeing on CNN’s broadcast of the event at the Capitol, and thousands were tuned into a stream from Hutch, who was chatting over live footage from C-SPAN. The popular political streamer HasanAbi had around 100,000 people watching him talk about the event while flipping between news coverage and aggregated views of various streamers from the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxpQw5"&gt;Direct streams from DC were less popular. DylanBurnsTV had just under 1,000 people watching his stream while he was standing away from the protests; elsewhere, close to 900 people watched TouringNews’ coverage from within a crowd. Commenters on these streams tended to express their astonishment at what they were seeing, shocked at the protesters’ attempt to stop the certification of the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31hYgQ"&gt;Twitch said its moderation policies do not have exemptions for newsworthy content, so streams of the protests may still be removed if they violate existing policies around violence and threats. “We strongly condemn the violent protests at the Capitol today. Any content that incites or glorifies violence, or shows gore of any kind, is not allowed on Twitch,” a Twitch spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They said the platform would “continue to monitor and remove any content that violates” its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8wPCM"&gt;There didn’t appear to be any political labels or warning messages on Twitch streams pointing viewers to verified information, unlike platforms like YouTube and Twitter. Twitch has largely evaded the pressure faced by YouTube and other platforms in recent years, in part because its lengthy broadcasts can be harder to review and in part because the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915580/twitch-moderation-communities-ceo-emmett-shear-twitchcon"&gt;seems to take a more aggressive stance on moderating speech&lt;/a&gt;, rather than attempting to be a platform for anything and everything. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;President Trump was briefly banned&lt;/a&gt; in June for broadcasting “hateful” language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpFFV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tone was decidedly different on pro-Trump social platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYA4k"&gt;Platforms used by the president soon found themselves grappling with another issue: a video from the president himself, in which he restated his lie that the election was stolen from him and told protesters “you have to go home now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UL0KYT"&gt;Around 4:20PM ET, Trump posted the video to both Facebook and Twitter. Twitter labeled the tweet with a warning that his claims of fraud were disputed, and it deactivated most forms of engagement with the tweet “due to a risk of violence.” Around 6:30PM, Twitter removed the video completely saying it violated the platform’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfVEDF"&gt;Facebook initially added a far vaguer label that did not say Trump’s claims were wrong or disputed, allowing the post to quickly gain tens of thousands of shares, comments, and likes. Around an hour after it was posted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;Facebook removed the video entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AiuupJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Rosen (@guyro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WKDeok"&gt;Facebook’s VP of integrity, Guy Rosen, called the moment an “emergency situation” and said the company believed the video “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” The video was also posted to YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;which removed it&lt;/a&gt; under a policy banning misinformation around voter fraud impacting the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer of Facebook and an influential voice on platform policy issues, said on Twitter that it was time for the two platforms to “cut him off.”  “There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won’t do it,” he wrote. Facebook and Twitter have for years pushed back against pressure to ban Trump, though Twitter has been more aggressive about putting limits on his tweets since last May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MnWYJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There have been good arguments for private companies to not silence elected officials, but all those arguments are predicated on the protection of constitutional governance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won't do it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nji6A4sJum"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nji6A4sJum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1346932573235077121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lBwHih"&gt;On Facebook, it was easy to find footage from the protests. A stream from NewsNationNow, which was being carried by a number of local news stations, appeared to have more than 20,000 viewers across a number of channels it was being broadcast on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzMiA"&gt;As the mob stormed the Capitol, Facebook and Instagram continued to allow searches for #StopTheSteal, and the posts were presented without warning labels. It was hard to find live videos through the hashtag on Facebook, which mostly surfaced older information. On Instagram, the hashtag was filled with screenshots of tweets presented alongside photos and videos of people rushing into the Capitol. One video appeared to show police officers pushing back protesters who tried to rush by them farther into the building. Instagram initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it was reviewing the hashtag; shortly before 6PM ET, the company said it had restricted the hashtag so that only top posts would show up and most new posts were not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyjmWd"&gt;“The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGQXQX"&gt;The tone was decidedly different on Parler — a right-wing Twitter clone — where users mostly posted in support of the protest. “They pushed patriots too far,” one wrote. “1776 HAS COMMENCED AGAIN!!!” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKDPT8"&gt;On TheDonald.win, a successor to the banned subreddit r/The_Donald, a forum thread was posted as a central location to watch and chat as “PATRIOTS STORM THE CAPITOL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSHoKF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story has been updated with details on Facebook and Twitter’s responses to Trump’s video post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U1fVL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Facebook and YouTube have both removed Trump’s video. Instagram has restricted the #stopthesteal hashtag. This story has been updated to include the new developments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M71QMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Twitter has now removed Trump’s video as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘felony streaming’ measure is aimed at piracy services, not Twitch streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-HEARING-BANKING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1NHKOnCEC6e4pejDMhXKMi2j7Y=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567803/1229890894.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AL DRAGO/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gXrIH"&gt;Yes, Congress approved a new bill Monday that would classify illegal streaming as a felony offense, but the feds won’t be going after your favorite Twitch streamers, YouTubers, or their subscribers. They’re more interested in services dedicated to streaming pirated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir5jYQ"&gt;Monday night, Congress approved &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;an over $2 trillion government&lt;/a&gt; spending and coronavirus relief package that included a handful of controversial copyright and trademark measures. A felony streaming bill, authored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), was included as part of that massive package. The news circulated all across the internet; in a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/the-covid-19-stimulus-bill-would-make-illegal-streaming-a-felony"&gt;poorly headlined &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;article, tweets, and YouTube videos. Quickly, content creators and their fans grew increasingly concerned that the bill could threaten their livelihoods or their favorite means of entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEn8JQ"&gt;But according to a press release from Tillis’ office and statements made by tech advocacy groups like Public Knowledge, streamers and their fans have no cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79Uq7E"&gt;“As a general matter, we do not see the need for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement,” Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-responds-to-senator-tillis-felony-streaming-copyright-proposal/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. “However, this bill is narrowly tailored and avoids criminalizing users, who may do nothing more than click on a link, or upload a file. It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfmXR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CafsyX"&gt;The text of the bill affirms this reading. On its fourth page, &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-legislation-led-by-tillis-and-leahy-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations-to-be-signed-into-law"&gt;the bill outlines&lt;/a&gt; what would qualify as felony behavior under the law. Currently, streaming unlicensed content is a misdemeanor offense. Previously, organizations like the NFL would sue sites like NFLBite that recast games, but if approved, the Tillis measures would open the door for the FBI to pursue those website owners under threat of prison time. But while the penalties and enforcement are both stepping up, the bill wouldn’t change what’s legal and what’s not. More importantly, there’s nothing in the text of the bill that suggests platforms’ moderation of everyday copyright violations would need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjiikh"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/covid-relief-bill-still-includes-felony-streaming-act-1845929782"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Tillis’ office describing the purpose of the legislation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FghP3u"&gt;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act will apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fqIRyY"&gt;Still, it’s totally understandable that YouTubers and streamers would freak out about a bill whose final text was released only days before it was approved. Social video platforms haven’t done the best job in the past with copyright, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims, and strikes. YouTube’s algorithm frequently flags content as violating copyright even when it doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037763/youtube-copyright-claim-studios-update-automatic-trim-tool-studios"&gt;For a long time&lt;/a&gt;, copyright owners like Universal were able to claim videos without expressly stating where the copyrighted material appeared in the content. Copyright is messy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iog8Af"&gt;On December 16th, Twitch addressed this proposal in its town hall, saying that the company did not expect the bill to affect its platform or its users. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qy95f"&gt;That doesn’t mean copyright activists can rest easy. The multitrillion-dollar package did include a copyright measure that civil liberties activists fear could have dramatic consequences. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;The CASE Act&lt;/a&gt; was also approved in the package and would create a quasi-judicial copyright claims court within the Copyright Office. Copyright holders could be awarded up to $30,000 in damages if they find their creative work being shared online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um2tAb"&gt;There’s also more bad copyright news coming from Sen. Tillis in the next congressional term. The senator is planning to offer up additional copyright changes next year that have already spooked the tech and creative industries. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBordelon/status/1341399864287096839?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that Tillis has been circulating a draft proposal of a bill that would completely reform the DMCA. The bill would include a “&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything"&gt;notice-and-staydown&lt;/a&gt;” provision that could make copyright bots, like YouTube’s Content ID, stricter. &lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that Tillis’ office would limit this provision to “complete or near-complete works” and would focus on larger enterprises rather than small platforms or creators. Still, current copyright-striking tech has been hit-or-miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlX3NZ"&gt;“This proposal [the incoming DMCA reform] would result in massive legal uncertainties for small businesses, startups and new creators; hurt competition and consumer choice for the next generation of platforms like TikTok and Parler; and lead to significant overblocking of everyday content on the platforms that Americans use every day to work, communicate and have fun,” said Joshua Lamel, executive director of the Re:Create Coalition, in a &lt;a href="https://www.recreatecoalition.org/press_release/recreate-statement-on-proposal-to-undo-the-dmca-would-fundamentally-end-online-creativity-as-we-know-it/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tuPIb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvCTCb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cooking videos were one small savior of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czkdQnMAlPci8islJ_2EYJTHe1A=/165x0:2112x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556333/remicruz.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9q8dc"&gt;Early one morning, a week after the pandemic started, chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt strapped a GoPro to his head and filmed himself making breakfast. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw2UyqIaik"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;, you can see López-Alt rummaging through his fridge, slicing and frying bacon, and peeling a bit of egg off a pan to give to his excited dog. There’s no recipe beneath the video, no voice-over instructions detailing what we’re seeing — it’s just a guy in a kitchen making breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9tqPq"&gt;Videos like these became both much-needed entertainment and valuable educational resources early in the pandemic, as a world of people realized they would be stuck at home indefinitely with their own (not necessarily stunning) cooking, and a little extra time to put into it. Food and drink streams surged in popularity on Twitch, doubling in hours watched year over year in August, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.streamelements.com/state-of-the-stream-august-2020-fall-guys-has-an-incredible-debut-shroud-returns-to-twitch-and-9689227dc972"&gt;StreamElements and Arsenal.gg&lt;/a&gt;. On YouTube, “cook with me” videos more than doubled in popularity starting in March and maintained that growth through October, YouTube told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/youtube-babish-cooking-shows-virus-339e5283220590ab3c250ef54c946895"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pJjVo"&gt;“It gives [viewers] confidence to do stuff in the kitchen,” said López-Alt, author of &lt;em&gt;The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science&lt;/em&gt;. His own videos lack the polish and perfect cuts of a professional show and include the slip-ups he makes along the way. “It gives them permission to make mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VWAve"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2zBtiYF5Gw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tX9Rt2"&gt;Cooking shows have been around for a century, but new formats online have revitalized the genre in recent years. On YouTube in particular, you can find step-by-step instructional lessons, personal “cook with me” vlogs, and stomach-churning food challenges like stuffing McDonald’s burgers and nuggets into an oversized burrito. On Twitch, chefs and home cooks broadcast themselves live from their kitchen as they prepare meals. And on TikTok, you can watch videos teaching you how to make a new dish in under a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSjXA4"&gt;Many hosts noticed a pickup in views and engagement as the pandemic went on. “It definitely has been skyrocket high with the views on things you can do at home,” Zahria Harvey, whose YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XOZAHRIAAA/videos"&gt;XO. ZAHRIAAA&lt;/a&gt; is known for “cook with me” videos, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Harvey says one viewer wrote in about making an affordable date night meal featured on her channel for an anniversary dinner because she couldn’t go out to dinner. “It was like wow, these videos are actually helping a lot of people during this time,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eL6sih"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v838587873&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dRAsrl"&gt;The influx of new viewers has also meant more live interaction for hosts on Twitch. “I find that the community is way more vocal and involved past March this year,” L.A., a photographer and former sushi chef who runs the channel &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thehungerservice"&gt;The Hunger Service&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. L.A.’s streams typically run for three to four hours and show him preparing and cooking a meal, talking through his process as he’s working. As he cooks, viewers ask questions about the process, like how sharp a knife needs to be or how to turn a recipe vegan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt3q5P"&gt;For López-Alt, who’s known for his &lt;em&gt;Serious Eats &lt;/em&gt;column, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt/videos"&gt;his channel&lt;/a&gt; became a fun outlet for both him and his viewers. The format he locked into — strapping a GoPro to his head — is what made video finally click for him, and it helped him reach viewers who weren’t familiar with his writing. “The food I cook on my channel is stuff I was generally making for lunch and for dinner,” López-Alt said. “I could do it consistently, people seemed to like it, [and] I enjoyed making it.” Viewers told him the videos were a bright spot and were helping them learn how to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NKbuw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8h2MO1vPRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJeJvX"&gt;Some creators have found that the surge in interest in their channels extends beyond cooking. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RemLife/featured"&gt;Remi Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber who frequently features cooking on her two channels, said that people have been more interested in basically anything you can do at home. For “vlogmas,” she’s been using cooking to fill the gap where she’d normally vlog about outdoor activities and holiday shopping. “I’ve just been implementing some sort of cooking-related thing every day, and people genuinely love it,” Cruz told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xwpkx"&gt;Viewers won’t always end up cooking what they see, but these videos can still make their time in the kitchen a bit more fun — or at least, distract them while they think about the great meals they’ll eventually go back out to a restaurant and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKe0J2"&gt;“People are looking for some sort of comfort,” L.A. said. “Comfort food is a thing, and watching these shows can offer that comfort. You may not be making it at the time, but maybe you will.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube had the mostly unremarkable year it was looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube Brandcast Presented By Google - Presentation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w3bs_RCe4qj4Did548TJKlU2vyk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68553440/528526206.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Taylor Hill/FilmMagic for YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zk7m8O"&gt;YouTube started the last few years off with nothing short of catastrophic headlines about some of its creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcBdQ"&gt;2017 saw Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg receive global criticism for a video in which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14605060/pewdiepie-disney-deal-lost-nazi-anti-semitic-imagery"&gt;displayed anti-Semitic imagery&lt;/a&gt;; 2018 found Logan Paul uploading footage of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest"&gt;dead body to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; 2019 ushered in loot crate controversies and dangerous stunts by top personalities like Jake Paul who took part in the &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; challenge by driving while blindfolded, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184382/bird-box-challenge-youtube-policies-tide-pods-thumbnails-external-links"&gt;fundamental policy changes&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Those events were only within the first few weeks of each year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt4kap"&gt;2020 was much quieter. The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters. That’s not to suggest YouTube had a perfect year; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;faced ongoing misinformation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52662348"&gt;plagues on its platform&lt;/a&gt;, faced intense scrutiny for its lack of action around governing the platform &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/youtube-under-pressure-over-election-falsehoods-suspends-oan-for-covid-19-misinformation.html"&gt;during the federal election&lt;/a&gt;, and is still figuring out how to handle a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/google-faces-3-2b-lawsuit-over-claims-it-violated-childrens-privacy/"&gt;number of issues&lt;/a&gt; with videos featuring kids. YouTube did not have a great 2020, but it wasn’t driven by a never-ending whirlwind of creator chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdgHwJ"&gt;It may have been factors brought on by the pandemic and the arrival of an enormous new rival that helped YouTube. The pandemic made it harder for creators to get together to film (although that didn’t stop some of YouTube’s more popular stars from &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jake-paul-interview-party-coronavirus-calabasas-mayor-2020-7"&gt;throwing parties at their Los Angeles mansions&lt;/a&gt;). Prank videos reliant on collaborations or travel diaries that can go astray were forced to transform into videos that could be filmed inside. Members of the “Vlog Squad,” one of YouTube’s most popular collaboration groups, worked on creative sketches that didn’t require them to be in each other’s space all the time, and Logan Paul mostly focused on his podcast that records in his California home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v3dr0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlLSE6"&gt;If YouTube had a quieter year, part of that is because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/10/21285309/tiktok-2020-user-numbers-revenue-smash-hit-mea-culpa"&gt;TikTok exploded in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. YouTubers also turned to TikTok as a way to continue making videos, staying on people’s radars, and having fun within a new ecosystem. Prominent YouTubers like Trisha Paytas, David Dobrik, James Charles, and Cody Ko have all been posting to TikTok regularly, building big audiences and even partaking in TikTok’s first creators program to earn additional revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1QUbv"&gt;Focus shifted to TikTok and a new class of creators who were experiencing meteoric rises to mainstream fame. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;Addison Rae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438111/charli-damelio-tiktok-triller-app-rival-dixie-marc-heidi"&gt;Charli D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, Chase Hudson, Josh Richards, and countless others found their way into the spotlight — and it was TikTokers whose questionable behavior was highlighted throughout the year. A pair of popular TikTokers was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405427/tiktok-parties-los-angeles-criminal-charges-bryce-hall-blake-gray"&gt;charged by the city of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; for throwing parties in a mansion, high-profile breakups and cheating scandals became &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/style/tik-tok-drama-taylor-lorenz.html"&gt;part of the “TikTokpocalypse,”&lt;/a&gt; and the possibility of everything disappearing after President Trump called for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;TikTok to be shut down&lt;/a&gt; sent the creator community into a panic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGUz1L"&gt;For years, YouTube has been the center of young creators doing dumb things and receiving global press for their antics. It was a never-ending cascade of pranks gone bad, mindless stunts, and fake drama spun up to generate hundreds of millions of views. It worked. Between 2016 and 2019, YouTubers were constantly in the news for the wrong reasons. The heyday of weird content on YouTube that attracted comedy lovers and people who lived online was replaced by a new era of teenagers with access to a lot of cash, no boundaries, and friends all trying to generate lucrative views on every video they posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5NYW"&gt;YouTube didn’t introduce a slew of new policies that suddenly made every creator on the platform start behaving. YouTube got lucky — people weren’t able to get into the same hijinks they could before. The company &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;tried over the years to mitigate poor behavior, but what helped the platform this year is the thing that, ironically, helped creators grow in the first place: making collaborations in very public, packed spaces became nearly impossible to do. CEO Susan Wojcicki once referred to the period between early 2017 and mid-2018 as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-25-susan-wojcicki-youtube-moderation/"&gt;YouTube’s “growing up years.”&lt;/a&gt; The executive wanted to find a way to move past the endless headlines about antics performed by popular creators on her platform. 2020 showed what a year of sensibility could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HLRufC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kduqVh"&gt;YouTube hasn’t grown up; its stars are still bickering with each other and getting into boxing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22158034/floyd-mayweather-logan-paul-fight-date-announced"&gt;matches with Floyd Mayweather&lt;/a&gt;. And YouTube creators were caught in various scandals this year. Old videos of Shane Dawson using blackface and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308288/shane-dawson-youtube-suspends-monetization-channels-blackface-older-videos"&gt;derogatory language resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;, leading to his channel being demonetized for a period of time. Jenna Marbles left the internet altogether after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21306858/shane-dawson-jenna-marbles-youtube-blackface-racism-content"&gt;racially insensitive videos resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;. Beauty mogul and YouTuber Jeffree Star found himself in a world of drama over &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9"&gt;alleged inappropriate past behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Jake Paul, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"&gt;continued to be Jake Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvgEB"&gt;The platform’s culture didn’t change in one year — but by happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to. In the early days of the pandemic, YouTube felt like old-school YouTube again. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;videos, always popular, seemed to soar even more as people had more time to play and make videos; people returned to daily vlogging; and lo-fi chillhop streams became hangouts for people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"&gt;stuck at home and trying to work&lt;/a&gt;. It was a quieter period for YouTube’s creators and a weird moment for anyone who’s tracked the site’s culture. For once, I’m not regularly talking about a severe incident to which a creator contributed. Instead, the greatest problems YouTube faced this year were on the policy side relating to misinformation and polarizing content — in many ways, problems of YouTube’s own making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gsVmb"&gt;I have no doubt that when YouTubers can start hanging out with each other there’ll be more headlines about antics. But for the first time in a few years, a year is ending without a YouTuber’s cataclysmic news cycle as the story of the year within the creator community. I genuinely didn’t think it was possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the pandemic inspired creative uses of technology in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEYyUpKLw8iwFwkfRnE3oB9potM=/205x0:1732x1018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68552676/one_zoom_to_rule_them_all_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Josh Gad’s Reunited Apart brought together the cast of the Lord of the Rings movies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5Rmva"&gt;The year that brought us the coronavirus pandemic, murder hornets, and the deaths of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Alex Trebek is probably one most people won’t be sad to bid adieu. Parents and kids were stuck together during lockdowns, trying to manage remote school and work, and everyone’s feeling good and frayed at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypCje1"&gt;At the start of the pandemic, media was abuzz with the notion that this pandemic and the resulting lockdowns would be a boon for the creative process. Suffering and isolation, the logic goes, beget great works of art and literature: just look at &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/broadway-shutdown-could-be-good-theater-coronavirus/607993/"&gt;Shakespeare, who apparently cranked out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Lear&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/em&gt; while quarantined during an outbreak of bubonic plague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="amwXv9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We built a 2020 time capsule out of synthetic DNA — here’s how","url":"https://www.theverge.com/science/22188122/dna-data-storage-synthetic-time-capsule"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jvr26F"&gt;While we may not yet know if another Shakespeare found their muse during the current pandemic, plenty of people found their creative spark thanks to technology, with librarians, artists, and even epidemiologists using the tools at hand not just to distract from the tedium of lockdown, but to put forth new approaches to how we learn and connect with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P7hhvl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;Librarians used Google Forms to create virtual escape rooms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Harry Potter escape room" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5EhT5Fc_DG9xnD9QDJtFMvDf04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20083663/Screen_Shot_2020_07_14_at_3.40.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;em&gt; escape room starts off by telling players where in the Wizarding World they are.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1bq9Ow"&gt;The easy-to-use format of Google Forms allowed librarians and teachers to create problem-solving exercises for students designed as digital versions of escape rooms. In addition to solving the puzzle of the game, the escape rooms let kids hone their geography, math, and reading comprehension skills, and are built around fun themes that included &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt;, and Marvel superheroes. Not only did they take away some of the tedium and chaos of online teaching and learning, but the virtual escape rooms were tools for staff development and community building. Brooke Windsor, a librarian in Ontario, put it this way: “We still want to sneak in that learning, broccoli-in-the-brownie style.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2QunsV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213184/tim-dunk-facetime-photoshoots-wedding-photography-lockdown"&gt;A photographer used FaceTime to create professional-looking portraits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzOf4M9xG5wUDXAv_tlv_LLK6fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22178797/facetime_photo_shoots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://timdunk.com/facetime-photoshoots" target="_blank"&gt;Tim Dunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographer Tim Dunk helped users create professional-quality photos via iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vcGMKJ"&gt;As big weddings were (mostly) canceled and postponed in 2020, UK wedding photographer Tim Dunk decided he needed another project to keep his creative juices flowing. “I had to deal with the shock and financial implications of [the coronavirus] like any other photographer. It also threw up another challenge: how do we as creatives stay creative?” &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2020/04/06/how-to-shoot-portraits-through-facetime/"&gt;Dunk wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7EmLQ"&gt;His solution: FaceTime photo shoots. The photo subject and Dunk connect on FaceTime, and he determines where the light in their house is best for a portrait. Then, using the Live Photo button on the iPhone (sorry, Android users) that lets you take photos during a FaceTime call, he snaps the pictures, then edits them in Lightroom. And £10 from every shoot — he charges £50 for a set of 10 to 15 photos — goes to the &lt;a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/about/"&gt;Trussell Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based charitable organization that supports food banks. He’s also created photo books of some of the portraits taken during the project, and he &lt;a href="https://timdunk.com/how-to-shoot-portraits-through-facetime"&gt;penned a how-to&lt;/a&gt; for other photographers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gxcZ1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/80s-zoom-reunion-josh-gad-film-giants-lockdown-reunited-apart-frozen-olaf"&gt;Josh Gad created Gen X nostalgia on Zoom by reuniting movie casts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q9qns"&gt;Okay, so not all of the movies in Gad’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCd3u3uQ0DtlDfVU0GlKpQ"&gt;Reunited Apart&lt;/a&gt; YouTube series are from the 1980s, but the casts of &lt;em&gt;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Splash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Goonies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; meeting on Zoom brought back the faces of some cultural touchstones of the American Gen-X childhood. Each episode benefits a different charitable organization and garners thousands, and in some cases, millions of views. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_U0S6x_kCs&amp;amp;ab_channel=JoshGad"&gt;One Zoom to Rule Them All&lt;/a&gt; episode featuring the cast of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; drew 5.7 million views and benefited nonprofit organization &lt;a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/"&gt;No Kid Hungry&lt;/a&gt;. “Everybody is going through the same craziness, trying to operate in a world that’s still very new and complicated, where our sole connection is through the internet,” Gad &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/80s-zoom-reunion-josh-gad-film-giants-lockdown-reunited-apart-frozen-olaf"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kN0UGS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/creative-ways-teachers-are-using-social-media-during-the-pandemic"&gt;A teacher created science projects on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="KtRNAT"&gt;If any app is having a moment in 2020, it’s the ubiquitous TikTok — fighting the Trump administration in court and at the same time becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/10/21285309/tiktok-2020-user-numbers-revenue-smash-hit-mea-culpa"&gt;most-downloaded app in the world&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. Jacksonville, Florida science teacher Nancy Bullard created a Mrs. B TV on TikTok, dressing like everything from an astronaut to a chicken in the name of science. Bullard guides students through science experiments they can do without parental supervision, so parents working from home can have a bit of a reprieve. The response from students has been overwhelmingly positive, &lt;a href="https://www.cms.k12.nc.us/News/Pages/Mrs.-B-TV-Science-teacher-gets-creative-to-reach-students.aspx"&gt;Bullard said&lt;/a&gt;. “Whether it is the latest dance trend or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, we have to find our kids on the platforms they’re comfortable with.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545725/fauci-tufts-chart-mood-coronavirus-medicine"&gt;An epidemiologist created a Level of Fauci meme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Fauci’s facial expressions say it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GXvAyI"&gt;During the coronavirus pandemic, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Anthony Fauci has become one of its most recognizable faces — and it’s an extremely expressive face that usually conveys what he’s thinking. Epidemiologist Karen Sautter Errichetti needed a way to check in with how her students were coping with... everything... and created an unscientific chart based on the five-part Likert scale, using photos of Fauci on a one to five scale (later expanded to a nine-photo scale) so students could choose their mood for that day. Photos of the NIAID director smiling were the most difficult to find, Errichetti noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc18sP"&gt;Word is that Fauci himself has seen the scale, which is not quite the introduction Errichetti envisioned; she and her colleagues consider him a rock star of sorts. “Creating your own memes,” Errichetti told me, “that’s a little bit of your own kind of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
