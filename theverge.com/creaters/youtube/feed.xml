    <title>YouTube cancels Rewind for good after years of everyone hating it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Will Smith in Rewind" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJbJjrli6W_ED6p4PlockymRPW0=/74x0:1370x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964471/Screen_Shot_2019_02_05_at_3.24.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2jX8n"&gt;YouTube Rewind — the company’s annual year-end round-up of trends, creators, memes, and the most popular videos on the site — has been canceled for good, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/10/07/youtube-no-longer-making-year-end-rewind-videos/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4eZN7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all the creators involved in Rewind - we’ll be   for your Rewinds as we refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube   with a different and updated kind of experience - stay tuned! → &lt;a href="https://t.co/kI69C24eL0"&gt;https://t.co/kI69C24eL0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube Creators (@YouTubeCreators) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeCreators/status/1446103025500577796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXGom"&gt;Instead, YouTube will “refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube [fire emoji] with a different and updated kind of experience,” although the company didn’t elaborate further on what it’ll be replacing Rewind with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeBa8l"&gt;YouTube will also be relying on creators on its platform to fill the gap, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll “continue to be inspiring to see the myriad of ways the most creative content producers in the world — our YouTube creators — encapsulate the end of year in their video recaps, as YouTube retires its own Rewind video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsiA"&gt;The news of YouTube canceling Rewind permanently isn’t a huge surprise. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1326947861305696263"&gt;already took off 2020&lt;/a&gt;, citing the difficulties of the year: “2020 has been different. And it doesn’t feel right to carry on as if it weren’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HCw9Sy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is canceling Rewind this year because 2020 has been too much ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562697/youtube-rewind-canceled-2020-pandemic-creators-community"},{"title":"PewDiePie makes his return to YouTube Rewind after two years of controversy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"},{"title":"YouTube Rewind 2018 is officially the most disliked video on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mInJcb"&gt;But Rewind had already been struggling long before the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;2018’s video&lt;/a&gt; was viciously panned by the YouTube community (to this day, it remains the most disliked video ever posted to the platform). Creators argued that the company was shifting focus from the “real community” — including controversial creators like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy"&gt;Logan Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095517/pewdiepie-t-series-youtube-fan-campaign-subscribers"&gt;PewDiePie&lt;/a&gt; — in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;more advertiser-friendly choices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u9LMp"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"&gt;2019’s video&lt;/a&gt; attempted to skirt controversy entirely by shifting its format from the big-budget mashup of YouTubers from years past to a more ordinary (and boring) list of clips of most-watched creators, videos, and trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s1yZV"&gt;But whether well-received or endlessly dunked on, Rewind videos have been a big part of YouTube’s culture for the past decade. Hopefully, whatever YouTube does end up doing to replace its big year-end celebration ends up a little less controversial going forward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCS0PP8jNbuypyRbk4vOZm5qOas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948062/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal and YouTubeTV reach agreement to avoid dropped channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pkam8ki9vKonbOaWjIQxK5Od5G4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941898/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;After YouTube TV and NBCUniversal announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;a “short” extension&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to keep more than a dozen channels on the live TV service, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal say they have finalized a deal — meaning NBC-owned channels will stay put on YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfn9sz"&gt;“We’re thrilled to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying the full NBCUniversal portfolio of channels,” according to a Saturday &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;update to YouTube’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That means you won’t lose access to any of their channels, and YouTube TV will continue to offer 85+ networks for $64.99. We appreciate NBCUniversal’s willingness to work toward an agreement, and we also appreciate your patience as we negotiated with them on your behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imfEEA"&gt;With a deal reached just days after it looked as though the channels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;could get dropped&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV users will still have access to a dozen-plus channels that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;SYFY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;Plus, regional sports networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gauL3"&gt;NBC Sports Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPTSH"&gt;NBC Sports California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YwwI4q"&gt;NBC Sports Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3okHSr"&gt;NBC Sports Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGCh71"&gt;NBC Sports Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;YouTube TV had said that should the service lose the channels, it would have lowered its prices by $10 per month. But with a deal reached, the price will stay the same — and YouTube TV users will still be able to find their TV within one app without needing to subscribe elsewhere to get coverage from NBC-owned properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ah fuck: YouTube reinstates classic ‘I can’t believe you’ve done this’ meme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSJbf66JxNC5YwGRsrlZ-9sMhfE=/154x0:825x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924627/Screen_Shot_2021_09_29_at_10.19.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JP9Z5p"&gt;Whether it wants to be or not, YouTube is a guardian of internet history, with countless classic videos sitting in its archives. That makes it jarring when the company acts like what it is: a multinational corporation with no real understanding of this value. Case in point, this week, YouTube removed the original upload of the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;Ah fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this&lt;/a&gt;” meme, initially rejecting an appeal from its creator (and the guy who can’t believe this was done) and claiming that the clip violates the company’s “violent or graphic content policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADM4jv"&gt;In the words of &lt;a href="http://paulweedon.co.uk/"&gt;Paul Weedon&lt;/a&gt; himself, star of and uploader of the original video: Ah, fuck. “It’s completely out of the blue,” Weedon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; regarding the takedown. “I made the case that it’s been online going on 15 years and is basically part of internet culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGSbp7"&gt;Weedon &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1442952265552187394"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out the news of the takedown and his unsuccessful appeal, noting that the video had been on YouTube for 14 years and racked up 12 million views in that time with “no issues whatsoever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIdHJI"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKbU8B-QVZk"&gt;now the video is available again&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1443247423250444295"&gt;response tweet&lt;/a&gt; from its TeamYouTube account, the video hoster now says “this was a mistake on our end and your video is back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVy7jq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So this has happened. &lt;a href="https://t.co/O2baPp0ybq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O2baPp0ybq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Weedon (@Twotafkap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1442952265552187394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cypzMC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following up: this was a mistake on our end and your video is back up. We’re so sorry about the frustration this caused &amp;amp; have shared feedback with the team to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Look out for an email from us with more soon.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1443247423250444295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvPe6"&gt;The clip is a classic: low-res, contextless, and instantly funny. And, of course, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/O7lRV1VHv1g"&gt;countless re-uploads&lt;/a&gt; still exist (alongside the other, legitimately horrible content that YouTube is happy to leave up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYDRV4"&gt;The video has been &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;remixed and re-memed&lt;/a&gt; in countless ways since it first went viral in the mid-2010s, and Weedon himself has an interesting relationship with the content. In an &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnqj/my-life-as-a-meme-i-cant-believe-youve-done-this-revisited"&gt;article for &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, he describes how the clip was part of a series of “stunts” he and his friends filmed in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt; and how he sold the original rights for the video to the now-defunct &lt;a href="http://Break.com"&gt;Break.com&lt;/a&gt; and isn’t now sure who even owns the IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmVoXM"&gt;“At the time, going viral wasn’t really comparable to any other experience and it certainly wasn’t something I could discuss in solidarity with my friends,” writes Weedon. “All of a sudden you’re everywhere and it’s out of your control. You either try to fight it and get destroyed or embrace it and try to cash in. After yanking down several other videos on my YouTube channel, I opted for the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieeNQv"&gt;To add insult to injury, Weedon is currently exploring the possibility of making a documentary about the meme, so the takedown added a little twist to the proceedings. “This takes things in a completely different direction,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It says a lot about where YouTube is going. On Twitter, people seem to be saying the same thing: that this is a video that represents what YouTube used to be, and they’ve torched it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXLG9y"&gt;Weedon says he’s found all the footage from the day the meme was shot and that he and a group of friends are still exploring how to tell the story. “We’re still figuring out what we want to do with it,” he says. “Though, I definitely regret promising the documentary would be coming ‘soon’ in the teaser. I forgot how impatient people on the internet can be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AbL5kb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 29th, 6:13AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated the story with comment from Weedon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rQDKS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 29th, 1:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated the story to reflect the video’s reinstatement and added a statement from YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube bans vaccine misinformation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwFvdJjRlIn8rwJqCXERzGNOQBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925721/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoXAgg"&gt;In a new attempt to stem the flow of anti-vaccine misinformation, YouTube said Wednesday that it &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123"&gt;won’t allow videos&lt;/a&gt; that claim vaccines approved by health authorities are dangerous or don’t work. The platform is also banning prominent anti-vaccine accounts, including Joseph Mercola’s channel and the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-linked Children’s Health Defense Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxHclE"&gt;YouTube pulled ads from anti-vaccination content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236839/youtube-demonetization-anti-vaccination-conspiracy-videos-dangerous-harmful-content"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and said in October 2020 that it would remove videos that pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. The new policy expands to block misinformation around other vaccines, including the flu shot, the HPV vaccine, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Videos that inaccurately claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism or that the flu shot causes infertility, for example, will not be allowed under the new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibtnR2"&gt;There are some exceptions: YouTube will still allow videos that include people sharing their personal experiences with vaccination. It’ll remove that content if the channels they’re on “demonstrate a pattern of promoting vaccine misinformation.” The guidelines say that the platform will also allow videos with information violating the policy if that video includes other context, like statements from medical experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmS7BT"&gt;Along with the new policy, YouTube is also terminating the channels of major anti-vaxxers, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those include Joseph Mercola, the Children’s Health Defense Fund, Erin Elizabeth, and Sherri Tenpenny. Channels for two other major figures, Rashid Bhuttar and Ty and Charlene Bollinger, were terminated a few months ago, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVYYO"&gt;Those anti-vaccine figures are all part of the “Disinformation Dozen,” a group identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes"&gt;responsible for the bulk&lt;/a&gt; of misleading claims about vaccines on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZZdql"&gt;YouTube expanded its vaccine policies after noting that misinformation around all vaccines could contribute to mistrust around the COVID-19 vaccine, Matt Halprin, YouTube’s vice president of global trust and safety, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/youtube-ban-joseph-mercola/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few months, the backlash to COVID-19 vaccinations has been expanding to target other vaccines: the Tennessee Department of Health temporarily suspended outreach around childhood vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;, and a Florida state senator &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/09/23/florida-gop-state-senator-reportedly-wants-to-review-non-covid-vaccine-mandates-for-schoolchildren/?sh=20057532545d"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he wants to “review” school vaccination requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlbn07"&gt;Facebook similarly expanded its vaccine misinformation policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272883/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-expanded-removal-autism"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; to block claims that the shots are dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afpaag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 30, 8:38AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article misidentified the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. linked fund as the Children’s Defense Fund. It is the Children’s Health Defense Fund. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music’s new Wear OS app is coming to older smartwatches after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scsn2o9zrSMFeCO3evBFGBk801w=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914927/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqxiAT"&gt;YouTube Music’s Wear OS app is rolling out to a handful of older Wear OS 2 smartwatches from the likes of Fossil, Michael Kors, and Mobvoi starting this week, after previously launching exclusively on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642047/google-youtube-music-wear-os-3-app-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;Samsung’s new Wear OS 3-powered Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The app lets YouTube Music Premium subscribers download songs to compatible smartwatches and listen to music offline without needing a paired phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZEED"&gt;The new app was first detailed when Google and Samsung announced they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging their Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to create Wear OS 3, and initial reports suggested it &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;wouldn’t be coming&lt;/a&gt; to devices running the older Wear OS 2 operating system. However, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621394/spotify-wear-os-2-app-offline-playback-smartwatch"&gt;Spotify’s offline support on Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, the new YouTube Music app will now be available for a broader selection of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y3vOsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Initial reports suggested it would be exclusive to new Wear OS 3 watches&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCvHZ"&gt;The app will be downloadable from the Google Play Store on compatible devices and supports Google’s Smart Downloads feature, which automatically refreshes the songs downloaded for local playback when connected to Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx6k83"&gt;Google says the app will be available this week for Fossil and Michael Kors’ Gen 6 lineup of smartwatches, as well as Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular / LTE, and TicWatch E3. More Wear OS 2 smartwatches are getting the app later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord starts testing YouTube integration weeks after Google shuts down music bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRhV_mehDPmQbIRM8S0SwOau7Yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894750/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9XiKy"&gt;Discord is starting to test YouTube integration, just weeks after Google-owned YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;forced two popular Discord music bots offline&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube integration has started appearing in a small number of Discord servers today as part of what appears to be a new test of a collaboration between Discord and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EhvSS"&gt;The feature is called Watch Together, and as the name implies, it allows Discord members to watch YouTube videos together. A test of a similar Discord feature &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;started 10 months ago&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing and resurfacing as Watch Together today, and we understand the company has re-prioritized this particular feature due to the recent music bot shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MayWlMVw-gKQplzfV_ifr2UAej4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869385/discordwatchtogether.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new Watch Together feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGfKJu"&gt;Watch Together is very similar to the experience of someone broadcasting their screen in Discord, and the button to launch it even appears alongside the video and screen sharing options. It’s designed specifically with YouTube in mind, allowing Discord server members to create a playlist of YouTube videos by searching or pasting in YouTube links. You can even toggle a remote button that lets other Discord server members share the ability to control playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi2Pa4"&gt;While it’s not identical to the popular Rythm and Groovy Discord music bots, you can use Watch Together to listen to music through YouTube in Discord. You may end up hearing or seeing ads, though. Discord warns, when you first use the Watch Together feature, that “you may see ads during YouTube videos.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfAIIX3CAO2vnVHBRy3cZYO373k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870709/discordyoutube.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s YouTube ads warning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R6i2t9"&gt;The addition of ads and potential revenue opportunity for Google-owned YouTube comes just weeks after YouTube began aggressively shutting down Discord music bots. The Google-owned company sent a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;legal cease and desist letter to Groovy Bot&lt;/a&gt; last month, forcing the popular service offline within days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;YouTube then turned its attention to the most popular Discord music bot&lt;/a&gt;, Rythm, and it ceased working earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxnRQH"&gt;We understand that this is only rolling out to Discord friends and family servers today, followed by a wider beta to small servers and then broader availability in the next few weeks. Discord is tentatively aiming to launch it to all users by the end of October. If you’re interested in testing the feature, it’s currently live in &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/discordgameslab"&gt;Discord’s Game Labs server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIpVm5"&gt;We reached out to both Discord and Google to comment on the new YouTube integration, but Discord declined to comment. Google did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkthpV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 22nd 4:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with information about the ads experience in Watch Together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests video downloads for your desktop browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6P8Gezby4-eqIFQ2P1mRl5h1O2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894383/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lsg7EP"&gt;YouTube is testing an official way to download videos on your desktop web browser (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you want to see if you’re eligible for the test, which runs through October 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;check out YouTube’s experimental features page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists tests available for Premium subscribers. I was able to opt in to the test, but a colleague of mine wasn’t, which seems to indicate that not everyone is able to try the feature just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy3wOj"&gt;If you’re opted-in and on a supported browser (“the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera,” according to Google), when you’re watching a video, you should see an option to download the video under the player. When you click it, YouTube will download the video, which you can then watch from the Downloads section that’s accessible from the hamburger menu on the left side of the screen. I can’t find a way to download videos and watch them outside of my browser — this seems to be more of a way to watch YouTube videos offline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vY_jez-K439lpdn6Bmzyd6dgIBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870345/Screen_Shot_2021_09_22_at_11.14.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Downloads section looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nTmN2C"&gt;Be warned that the feature might be a little buggy. Shortly after I first opted in, videos didn’t download; their progress would hang at zero percent. But when I tried again a few minutes later, the feature worked as expected. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Demi Adejuyigbe reminds us that, once again, it’s September 21st </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-ckEXjcjxGV5E2WYUlT4LPsPGk=/287x0:2594x1538/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888999/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.28.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Demi Adejuyigbe/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhAGjL"&gt;The 21st of September? Buddy, that’s today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dNXMu"&gt;Lest you forget, comedian Demi Adejuyigbe has returned to memorialize Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire Day — more specifically September 21st, subject of the band’s evocative summer anthem “September.” For years, Adejuyigbe has jumped on the opportunity to mark the occasion with elaborate, often outrageous videos that have included everything from aerial banners to a mariachi band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nauq0I"&gt;The videos have become such a reliable marker of the end of summer that Adejuyigbe was able to hit a goal of $50,000 for charity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449277/september-21st-date-demi-adejuyigbe-earth-wind-fire"&gt;in just three hours&lt;/a&gt; last year, with the campaign ultimately generating more than $330,000 over the period of several days (more than $50,000 per charity listed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBlv5V"&gt;Adejuyigbe’s video for 2021 hit the interwebs not too long after 9:21AM PT. This year, he’s raising money for Imagine Water Works, a disaster relief organization helping with Hurricane Ida relief; the West Fund, a nonprofit for abortion access in Texas; as well as climate advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement. Adejuyigbe is raffling off a painting — September 21st-themed, as expected — that he promises to hand-deliver to the winner, regardless of where they live. Donations of $10 count toward a single raffle ticket. For each $100,000 reached, Adejuyigbe will also raffle off a September 21st jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nteekw"&gt;Adejuyigbe said this year’s video will be his last, but added that he hopes “we can use this last video to do some good.” Raffle tickets can be purchased &lt;a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21stthats-today-by-demi-adejuyigbe"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. As of 9:45AM PT, the fundraiser had already generated more than $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the YouTubers determined to find lost media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sCwC-RHX-F1GCne1KUh-_Mv9zQ=/119x0:1382x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866569/a2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bobdunga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AM5RO"&gt;When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ib-AJA7v9Kk"&gt;remember Slamball?&lt;/a&gt;) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It’s been stuck in my head for years. I guess you’re expecting me to link the commercial I’m describing, right? Well, I can’t, because I’ve never found it. I’ve never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what’s known as “lost media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM1W5Y"&gt;Online, there’s a lost media community dedicated to preserving everything from unaired television pilots to unreleased video game prototypes. Currently, the lost media community exists on both YouTube and &lt;a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home"&gt;the Lost Media wiki&lt;/a&gt;, an archive of thousands of lost media topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LSuperSonicQ"&gt;LSuperSonicQ&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known member of the lost media community and has many videos covering lost media topics such as the &lt;em&gt;Johnny Bravo&lt;/em&gt; pilot and unreleased My Chemical Romance songs. His fascination with lost media started on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6Hiq"&gt;“I knew nothing about lost media at all until I watched a video from this other kind of lost media YouTuber,” said LSuperSonicQ. “His name is blameitonjorge. And this is like, back in 2015… It was like, top 40 lost or banned episodes of kids TV shows.” LSuperSonicQ watched the video, and from that point on, he said, he was “hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ij0fR"&gt;Lost media searches can take a long time, depending on what is being sought after and whether there are any complications, such as nondisclosure agreements, people leaving jobs, or creators just not remembering past projects. LSuperSonicQ took months to find the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2s0nFAw8GeU"&gt;lost pilot for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Kappa Mikey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on Nicktoons Network in the mid-2000s. This lost pilot was made in order to pitch the show to MTV. LSuperSonicQ was able to contact the creator of the show and convince him to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8KoVLI3XuGM"&gt;upload that original pilot to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He now considers this his favorite piece of lost media. Plus, the search was a good learning experience for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNSk3y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KoVLI3XuGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDuUMd"&gt;“That was a really, really big deal, when that happened,” said LSuperSonicQ. “It was my longest-lasting media search at the time, and I learned a lot of techniques in that search that I have applied to future searches and how I go about contacting people and trying to find stuff. So it was a really, really big turning point in my own personal lost media journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3hu7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIqqmw"&gt;Not all searches end in success, but they can still be entertaining, since lost media is all about the search and why the media became lost in the first place. YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GWq_TBvJKWLFIb2eLp-bw"&gt;Bobdunga&lt;/a&gt; recently dove into the world of lost media in her hunt for the &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;video game, chronicling her search in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s"&gt;two-part Youtube documentary&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;game was always seen as a mystery by the lost media community, but most didn’t seem too interested in solving it. “I feel that a lot of that had to do with the fact that the game was inherently deemed as shovelware right off the bat,” said Bobdunga. The 2000s featured many licensed games that were created just to cash in on the popularity of an upcoming film release. “This was especially common for ‘girl games,’” said Bobdunga. “I think a lot of people behind the scenes didn’t have that good of a grasp at what girls liked in gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRERfr"&gt;For her, &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;was more than just another “girl game.” “What really drew me to wanting to dive into &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; was mainly because it was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation,” she said. “I think it was my want to dissect all of it, even if I didn’t come out finding the actual game, that really drew me into the project.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT0ECm"&gt;She told me this was her first time creating YouTube content about lost media, but not her first experience with it. “I’ve always been very partial to both true crime and lost media videos,” she said. “They seem to fit together really well, because they both share an ominous, almost storytelling-like atmosphere. And a lot of the time, the narrator will have a really calm or even creepy voice to further immerse the viewer. There’s something inherently spooky about lost media, especially in a digital age where we feel we can find everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFC0Qy"&gt;After months of searching, she eventually found it. An anonymous source sent her the game’s ROM file after viewing the first part of her documentary. Since then, she has recently &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3AQh9Nx6_Gw"&gt;uploaded footage of the game&lt;/a&gt; to her YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywokja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8ZUR2De15s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3SLvt0"&gt;Enthusiasts see lost media as a way to preserve history, even if it’s something as obscure as a canceled video game or lost TV pilot. “Not everything has such a strong digital footprint, and it’s important to preserve all types of media, whether it be physical or digital,” said Bobdunga. “It isn’t only a nostalgic memory for some but the media in question could also act as a small glimpse into what the world was like when it was produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuy427"&gt;LSuperSonicQ took a similar stance. “It has to do with pop culture. It has to do with, you know, what people were interested in at the time it was made. And there’s lost media that goes all the way back to the 1920s. They’re silent films that are lost for people to look for. And it goes all the way up to the 2010s and 2020s. By being able to preserve and archive and document that kind of thing, I really think, in a way, it really helps the historical aspect of our culture and where we came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CyiBe"&gt;Without the work of the lost media community, these parts of our culture and history would be lost to time. In the digital age, it has become harder for media to get lost, since almost everything is online, but it is still a possibility. If companies don’t do their part by making their older media easily available, then it’s up to the fans to do their part and preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;
