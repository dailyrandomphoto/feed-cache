  &lt;p&gt;The hidden costs behind your favorite apps, games, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iNHwd8"&gt;Online marketplaces like Etsy and Apple’s App Store allow businesses to flourish by connecting them to huge, global audiences. But these marketplaces are big businesses themselves, and in order to earn a profit, they take a cut of revenue from many of the other companies that use their space. It leads to a constant tension: apps like Tinder and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be nearly the phenomena they are today without the App Store, but they have to constantly pay Apple for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOSXIP"&gt;Apps are just one example of how online platforms for small businesses and independent creators have shifted the world we live and work in. Membership platforms, like Patreon, allow creatives to charge monthly payments in exchange for new videos, comics, and essays. Video services like Twitch and YouTube allow creators to monetize their time through advertising revenue. And marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon allow people to sell an assortment of products directly to customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flZWs"&gt;The cut each platform takes varies significantly: Apple notoriously takes 30 percent of many digital in-app purchases; Twitch takes a 50 percent cut of subscription fees and a cut of advertising; eBay asks people to buy space and then pay a fee.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing just how much each platform takes is crucial to figuring out what’s best for your business, or for understanding how the businesses you’re shopping from make money. Here are the various fees each platform takes, divided into four categories: app stores, creator platforms (including memberships, video services, and more), digital marketplaces, and games marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="da0jpB"&gt;App stores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kzShWw"&gt;App stores are where an enormous number of businesses operate. Whether someone is selling a line of jewelry on Etsy or spending oodles of money in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, app stores are the gateway to reaching people who shop on their phones and computers. Approximately 80 percent of Americans shop online, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, and more than half of those shoppers use a mobile device like a phone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwHDdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple App Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYKQp1"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in App Store sales can receive 15 percent commission through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769807344&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0P0P5jBkjzYy3mt-xf5cP3"&gt;Apple’s App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjDxJ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foAtEv"&gt;Google takes 15 percent in fees on developers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;first $1 million in Play Store revenue&lt;/a&gt; every year. After the $1 million threshold, the rate goes back up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXAXaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission &lt;a href="https://seller.samsungapps.com/help/termsAndConditions.as"&gt;on purchases through the app store&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be negotiated with Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBcY1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon App Store: &lt;/strong&gt;30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases. Subscription commission is 20 percent on video apps and 30 percent on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjo4FI"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in app store revenue can receive a 20 percent commission and 10 percent in “promotional credits” for Amazon Web Services through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537726/amazon-app-store-cut-revenue-1-million-80-20-10"&gt;Amazon’s Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcVW3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 percent commission on apps and 12 percent commission on PC games starting August 1st, 2021. A 30 percent commission on all apps, games, and in-app purchases on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsmi77"&gt;Non-game sellers can also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769796035&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pcTZw9XK5Y0m1YuGgSipt"&gt;use their own payment system&lt;/a&gt; and avoid Microsoft’s commission entirely as of July 28th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qZw43L"&gt;Creator platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SgT0wL"&gt;While app stores largely fit into the logic of their real-life, physical counterparts, an ever-growing breed of creator platforms allows people to monetize their personality and creativity more directly. Whether glued on to an existing social network like Facebook or reinventing old forms of entertainment like Clubhouse, creator platforms have found familiar ways to earn a buck on the backs of creator popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kw9kde"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pUePjZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;three types of plans&lt;/a&gt; creators can enroll in, and each plan comes with a different cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aKTu7G"&gt;Lite plan: Patreon takes 5 percent &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdqpTH"&gt;Pro plan: Patreon takes 8 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="27Ahq9"&gt;Premium plan: Patreon takes 12 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMLwm"&gt;The tiers are geared toward different types of creators and businesses. The pro tier lets a creator offer tiered memberships to fans, while the premium tier provides a dedicated contact at Patreon who can provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7bsBU"&gt;Then, there are payment processing fees. For creators in the United States, Patreon takes 5 percent plus 10 cents for payments of $3 or less. Payments over $3 result in a 2.9 percent cut plus 30 cents going to Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g66UD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans: &lt;/strong&gt;OnlyFans takes 20 percent of subscription fees and other earnings, like tips. Creators can set their subscription fees between $5 and $50 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLgHH"&gt;Tips &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/2/14/55"&gt;max out at $100&lt;/a&gt; for new users and go up to $200 for users who have had an account for four months or longer. You can tip $500 per day as a new user, with the limit increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl0STG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: &lt;/strong&gt;Twitter offers an array of ways for creators to make money. Super Follows &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator#sfstatus"&gt;allows creators to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month in exchange for perks like exclusive tweets. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; allow creators to charge for access to live audio events, with ticket prices ranging anywhere from $1 to $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmwxFS"&gt;For both products, Twitter takes a 3 percent commission on payments (after payment processing and in-app purchase fees, such as Apple’s 30 percent cut) until creators earn their first $50,000 on the platform, after which Twitter takes 20 percent. The features are only available to select users for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fREbo7"&gt;Creators can also &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tip-jar"&gt;receive money directly&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter’s Tip Jar feature, which is currently in beta and only available to some users. Twitter doesn’t take a cut, but payments are subject to the processing fees of whatever third-party payment service is linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIGoN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/646162679132229?id=558489708108283"&gt;lets creators offer monthly Fan Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; and receive support directly from their followers. Facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut each month, but the company has announced it won’t be taking any fees until 2023. Apple and Google do take their typical cut on mobile, though, reducing creators’ share to 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpksF"&gt;Facebook also offers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172"&gt;a tipping feature for livestreams called Stars&lt;/a&gt; — basically its answer to Twitch’s Bits. Creators get 1 cent per star, but (like Twitch below) viewers buy them for more than a penny each. If a viewer is buying only a few dollars at a time, Facebook might take upward of 18 percent of the money spent on tips. Creators also need to meet &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/understand-monetization-eligibility-status"&gt;Facebook’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to enable Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhjJ7q"&gt;Bulletin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;Facebook’s newsletter product&lt;/a&gt;, currently doesn’t take a cut of subscriptions, though Facebook has so far limited the platform to a select group of higher-profile writers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tAXPLP"&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwLzwg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube: &lt;/strong&gt;Creators primarily make money on YouTube through ad revenue. YouTube takes 45 percent of revenue from ads and gives creators 55 percent, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtube-standardizes-ad-revenue-split-for-all-partners-but-offers-upside-potential-1200786223/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzLo7"&gt;YouTube also has a number of ways for creators to get paid directly by viewers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9MnA3"&gt;The platform lets channels offer memberships, which are &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9355861?p=cm_internationalpricing&amp;amp;visit_id=637360435699211837-3596854631&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;monthly subscriptions that run between $1 and $100&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePlvW1"&gt;Similar to several Twitch features, YouTube’s Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks features give fans the ability to tip creators in exchange for perks like better comment placement in a livestream chat, custom stickers, and animations. Prices range from $1 to $500 for pinned Super Chat comments, $1 to $50 for Super Stickers, and $2 to $50 for Super Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEWAAi"&gt;YouTube takes 30 percent of the revenue earned on memberships and Super features once taxes and applicable app store fees are deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtIxX"&gt;Creators can also sell merchandise from select retailers directly to subscribers via the merch shelf underneath videos. YouTube doesn’t take a cut of merch sales, but creators may be subject to different fees depending on which of the 31 different supported retailers they partner with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3CbSp"&gt;YouTube also shares revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions based on the amount subscribers watch a creator’s videos. The company has not disclosed how that money is divided, but YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; most of the revenue from Premium goes to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cvnha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch: &lt;/strong&gt;A creator can start making money from ads, subscriptions, and donations once they become a Twitch affiliate, which takes a certain amount of streaming and followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOlblB"&gt;Twitch typically takes 50 percent of subscription fees. Subscription pricing varies by country to reflect the local cost of living. As an example, a base subscription is $4.99 per month in the US but around $1.20 per month in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmXvX"&gt;Twitch also offers streamers a way to be paid via donations using a virtual currency called bits. Twitch pays creators 1 cent per bit, so after receiving 100 bits, a streamer gets $1. The catch is, viewers pay extra up front to buy those bits: 100 bits costs $1.40 to buy on the web, or around $2 to buy on mobile to account for app store fees. That means anywhere from 29 percent to 50 percent of money spent toward tipping is being lost to fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZwiB0"&gt;Streamers frequently accept donations through third-party payment platforms, too. Twitch doesn’t take a cut of these, but the platforms themselves may come with their own &lt;a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/twitch-donate-button-online-donations/"&gt;deductions for payment processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1J8T"&gt;On top of subscriber fees, streamers also earn ad revenue — usually around $3.50 for every 1,000 views of an ad on their channel. For both subscriptions and advertising, bigger streamers may get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BAgG9v"&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rnekUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse: &lt;/strong&gt; Live social audio app Clubhouse allows listeners &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/introducing-payments"&gt;to pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; via a “Send Money” button. Clubhouse doesn’t take a cut of the payments, and the person leaving the tip is asked to cover the payment processing fee from Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Z3Y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its subsidiary Anchor, Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;allows podcasters to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify won’t take a cut until 2023, after which the company will charge a 5 percent commission. Creators have to cover payment processing fees out of their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEvz7v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;Subscriptions in Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are subject to the same rules as other subscriptions on Apple platforms: there’s a 30 percent commission to start, but if subscribers stick around for a year, the commission drops to 15 percent. Creators also have to pay $19.99 per year to offer subscriptions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFQOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its live audio feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, Discord offers creators the ability to sell tickets to their audio events. The feature is currently in a limited beta, and Discord hasn’t announced if it will keep a portion of ticket sales or when the feature will be available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l1Hn6e"&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rsWmOU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr: &lt;/strong&gt;A subscription feature, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus&lt;/a&gt;, lets creators offer subscriber-only posts for $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month. Tumblr takes a 5 percent commission on subscription fees, and for subscriptions made through iOS or Android, creators will lose an additional 30 percent to the respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L56CvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack: &lt;/strong&gt;The newsletter platform takes &lt;a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost-"&gt;10 percent of subscription fees&lt;/a&gt;. Substack lets writers choose how much they want to charge newsletter subscribers per month or year. (There’s also a free tier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHh9N7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wattpad: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiction publishing platform Wattpad offers a limited form of monetization for certain creators. &lt;a href="https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022692911-Paid-Stories-Program"&gt;Invite-only Paid Stories&lt;/a&gt; allows fans to purchase coins to unlock entries in an ongoing story or novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ARgg"&gt;Currently, Wattpad sells coins in several different packages (you can get nine coins for 99 cents, for example) and chapters are usually priced at three coins each (though some go for more). Wattpad says writers receive the “majority of the revenue from the program,” but it has not publicly disclosed the exact split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tas7Ql"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Vella: &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon has its own take on Wattpad’s Paid Stories, &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G5TFR9WSHB46ZKFN"&gt;called Kindle Vella&lt;/a&gt;. Writers who publish with Vella receive royalties based on the number of tokens spent on an “episode” in their story, with token cost determined by the episode’s length (one token per 100 words). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFCNQ"&gt;Writers get to keep half of whatever a reader spent on the tokens they used to unlock their story, minus taxes and fees. The complicating factor is that Amazon offers tokens at different price points — you can buy 200 tokens for $1.99 or 1,100 tokens for $9.99 — so payouts can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq6k84"&gt;At those price points, for example, a writer who receives 100 tokens would either get $1 or 90 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dvhlsk"&gt;Digital marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aekChA"&gt;Digital marketplaces for physical goods are at the core of online shopping. Many of us use Amazon on a daily or weekly basis, or peruse eBay at work to keep an eye on the latest auctions. But while large businesses can be built on these platforms, their terms can be complicated to navigate and tend to ensure the platforms make a cut on just about every sale that goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9l9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook collects either 5 percent per shipment of products sold (one order can include multiple shipments if items are mailed separately), or a flat fee of 40 cents for shipments of $8 or less. This covers taxes, payment processing fees, and applies to all checkout transactions on both Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYoJCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412"&gt;Facebook is waiving the selling fee&lt;/a&gt; for all orders shipping through June 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWvS6P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is a complicated one. First, &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_wic_n#selling-plans"&gt;businesses can choose&lt;/a&gt; between using a professional selling plan, which costs $39.99 a month, or an individual seller’s plan, which has no monthly fee. Those on the professional tier do not have to pay a sales fee on items sold, while those on an individual seller’s plan pay $1 per sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Jqm4G"&gt;Amazon then takes a commission on each sale, including shipping fees. This fee depends on what the item is, typically ranging from 8 to 20 percent. There’s also a $1.80 closing fee for products listed under media categories, including books, DVDs, music, game consoles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGMlxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy:&lt;/strong&gt; Etsy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsell%3Fref%3Dftr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charges a 20-cent fee&lt;/a&gt; for people to list each item for sale. Then, for every product sold, Etsy takes a 5 percent transaction fee, and a payment processing fee of 3 percent plus 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FDHHi"&gt;The company also runs an advertising program that’s somewhat controversial with sellers. Etsy pays to advertise their products on sites like Google, and then takes up to a 15 percent fee (but no more than $100) if they lead to a sale. Small sellers can opt out, but larger sellers have to participate; for them, Etsy only takes a 12 percent referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDJv8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay sellers might pay a small fee&lt;/a&gt; to list a product and a 12.5 percent commission on the sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIY9Z"&gt;Fees can vary significantly depending on product category and listing type, though. eBay also offers paid premium store features that can reduce fees. It’s a fairly complicated series of options — you can get a sense of some possibilities for paying stores from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/run-your-store/subscriptions-and-fees.html#m22_tb_a2__2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21209964__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="8EauQs"&gt;Games marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="im3fHn"&gt;From a single developer to a huge studio, being on Steam or in the PlayStation store is a big deal for distribution. These giant marketplaces are also key businesses for the companies that run them, often meaning steep fees on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjp36I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam takes &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838?content_only=true"&gt;30 percent of all sales&lt;/a&gt; made until the first $10 million. That cut becomes 25 percent when a developer sells between $10 million and $50 million. For every sale after the first $50 million, Steam only takes a 20 percent cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No2ULR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic takes 12 percent of the revenue from all games sold, giving developers 88 percent. Epic CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1120441795010338816?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that of the 12 percent Epic collects, the company nets about 5 percent as profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtIZnS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlayStation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reported to take a 30 percent cut from games sold in the PlayStation Store, though the split isn’t publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvkLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b"&gt;takes a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from all games and in-game purchases sold through the console’s store under its standard developer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMZpzT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch.io&lt;/strong&gt;: Itch.io takes &lt;a href="https://itch.io/updates/introducing-open-revenue-sharing"&gt;a radical approach&lt;/a&gt; to how it handles its revenue share with its independent creators. By default, the platform takes 10 percent of each transaction before payment providers take their cut. But if creators choose, as part of Itch’s open revenue sharing, they can lower that cut to zero or raise it to as high as 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nofJy8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 2021, 9AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published in September 2020; it has been updated and expanded for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Building a career on pushing buttons and seeing what happens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zhWGLk"&gt;Today I’m talking to Doug DeMuro, one of my all-time favorite YouTubers. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsqjHFMB_JYTaEnf_vmTNqg"&gt;Doug’s channel is real simple&lt;/a&gt;: he reviews cars. New cars, old cars, weird cars: he drives them, pushes all the buttons, and tells you about their quirks and features, a phrase that is now inextricably linked to Doug in the car community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA4ULP"&gt;And last year, Doug expanded beyond YouTube and launched &lt;a href="https://carsandbids.com/"&gt;a car auction website called Cars and Bids&lt;/a&gt;, which is tightly focused on selling cars made after 1981, something Doug told me he will never change.  Now, a lot of YouTubers I know are trying to hedge against YouTube, so I really wanted to know about Doug’s business — how does he make his videos? How big is his team, and how does he manage his costs? These are questions every creator faces, and I think it’s worth exploring them more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O4Z3z"&gt;What’s going to surprise you is how much data from YouTube Doug actually tracks and how he uses that data to make decisions about what videos to make. Doug’s also a product reviewer, so we talked about what reviews are for, who they serve, and how Doug manages to keep himself independent in the face of auto industry glad-handing. Doug was pretty direct that he considers himself a journalist — and direct about how various car companies try to get favorable reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZdIaS"&gt;Of course, I also wanted to know about Cars and Bids — how’s it going almost a year later? How many people work there? Is it the exit strategy from the YouTube grind? And if so, how’s he going to get people to use it without calling it out in every video? I think the answers to all of that will surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbsVVX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaHqC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doug DeMuro, you’re the host of a very popular YouTube car review channel. And you run Cars and Bids, a car auction website. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iyp4kO"&gt;Thank you for having me, I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUnwFC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I’ve watched so many videos, I have to say “Cars and Bids” the way that you say it, or go my own way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hv2v"&gt;Right, right. “Cars and Bids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFEX2r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very interested in the dynamic between you running your YouTube channel and using the channel to launch a car auction website. But let’s start with the YouTube channel, it’s very interesting. We talk to a lot of creators on the show. There’s a lot happening in the creator space. When did you launch the channel and when did it become a full-time gig?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3ODaL"&gt;I launched the channel in the fall of 2013. There was one video that I launched with. I didn’t have any other videos planned. It was just the one. And at the time &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/"&gt;I was writing for &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was like, sort of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; tech blog of car blogs, basically. It was like the big one that everybody went to. And I had gotten a note from a reader who said, “Hey man, you should make videos.” And this was in 2013. I mean, this was kind of the forefront of this. And I was like, “Huh, that’s an idea.” Of course, now that’s how everybody starts. Video is more now the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2M4H3"&gt;So I launched the channel at the end of 2013, and then it took off. And at some point in 2015, I realized that I was actually getting more views on the videos than on the writing. And I was like, “Well, maybe I should just be transitioning.” It’s never technically been a full-time job, I’ve always been doing something else on the side, but it has been sort of my main source of income since the end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017. So it’s been five years now — crazy to think about actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyQTaY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those five years seem very short, but in internet time you’ve lived through 50 different iterations of YouTube.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiaNkv"&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5nyLv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went back and watched some of your earliest videos and they bear a striking resemblance to the videos you put up now. The format is kind of the same. How have you thought about the pressures of YouTube as a platform changing versus what your audience is telling you versus what you want to make?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9bWKK"&gt;I will say, doing car reviews, you’re kind of insulated from some of the pressures of YouTube. It was interesting throughout this process. I watched from the sidelines the whole, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest"&gt;Logan Paul and the “suicide forest.”&lt;/a&gt; And I watched on the sidelines, the whole demonetization due to cursing, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849752/youtube-creators-ftc-fine-settlement-family-friendly-content-gaming-minecraft-roblox"&gt;I watched the child-friendly ad things, child videos&lt;/a&gt;. And none of that really applied to me because I do car reviews. It hasn’t really been that big of a deal in terms of how I structure my content to kind of deal with YouTube and with their changing policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="xD9J5k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0e9iaS"&gt;But there is this sort of pressure as a YouTuber to exist to create content and that sort of thing. And that’s always been the tough part of it for me. In terms of them changing the format, it’s interesting. When I first started, I didn’t know what to do. I thought I would do &lt;em&gt;Top Gear&lt;/em&gt;-style stuff, like funny videos and stupid car videos and stuff. And over the years I changed a little bit to do these car reviews that I do now. Which I prefer, frankly. So it worked out for the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EydgEh"&gt;But initially, I did a video about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcvHSmF28qc"&gt;how to pick up women in a Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, which was so stupid, and there was all this dumb stuff. But the reviews are where I prefer to be. And it seems like that’s where a lot of the audience is. More and more people are using YouTube to actually buy a car; “Is this something I’m interested in?” “How does this work?” “How is this better than that?” Whatever. And the automakers haven’t quite caught up with that completely yet, but people are there. And so those videos, they do really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMkIuE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first magazine that I loved, it’s a competition between &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And I feel like my car magazine consumption has tapered in direct correlation with how much car YouTube I watch. Whereas all the other kinds of stuff that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; covered, I’m reading more in all these other places. But when it comes to cars, I want to see it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JP6vQm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re very focused on, “I’m just going to push this button and see what happens and show you what happens” in a way that no written piece of journalism can necessarily capture. But that kind of focus and distilling lets you have a format, and a trademark — have you trademarked “Quirks and Features”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YlGLY"&gt;No, but I think at this point, if you were trying to use that, the YouTube audience would rip you apart. So it might as well be trademarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anPxuw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. You have a secondary enforcement mechanism. Like you don’t need to file the paperwork. The stan army has your back. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSt9hZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you find that format limiting? Because that’s kind of the other side of the coin. Now you’re known to deliver X thing and you kind of have to fit everything into X format. Do you find that limiting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f3Fid"&gt;Yeah, for sure. And for a long time I had a second channel where I kind of experimented a little bit more, and now I’ve taken the videos that I used to put on my second channel and I post them on the weekends on our main channel because I think there was an algorithm shift that kind of allowed me to do that. But yeah, it’s limiting for sure. It would be kind of fun to do some other stuff occasionally, but I have to say, I actually love this the most. Of all the content I’ve ever made, written, video, anything, I love checking out the new cars and pushing all the buttons and seeing how it all works. And based on the views, people seem to like that as well. So I don’t know. It is a little limiting, but I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfRzH9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I love checking out the new cars and pushing all the buttons and seeing how it all works ... It is a little limiting, but I love it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7nrmv"&gt;And I’ve been doing this format probably for about five and a half years. And I’m not even slightly tired of it. I would do it for the rest of time. Every single time, to this day, I go get in a new car, there’s like this sense of excitement and wonderment. ... Now some cars, I’ve just done a certain new Mercedes, then I do a different one, a lot of the tech is the same, that stuff I’m not as excited about. But &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzejSBdQ7LY"&gt;I just did this Hyundai pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, which is this little car-based Hyundai truck, it’s really weird. And I was just so excited when they delivered that. I was like, “Oh my God, I can’t wait to see what the hell this thing’s going to be about.” That’s still there, believe it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8vvcy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it the Santa Fe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymMWvV"&gt;It’s the Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8RGyA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santa Cruz, that’s right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrQsCv"&gt;Which is a terrible naming decision, in my opinion. You have two cars called Santa something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzrOOm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the listener, if you haven’t seen a picture of this truck, it does look remarkably crazy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTGpUk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You just mentioned an algorithm shift that allowed you to start posting more videos. That is kind of what we’re talking about here. Like did you get an email? Did &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neal Mohan, the chief product officer at YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, let you know? Did you perceive it? How are you tracking that stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ia7vJ"&gt;That’s a question not that many people ask me about. When people come to me in the street, they only want to talk about cars. They don’t really ask about the business of YouTube, which is half of what I do, right? Like half of it is cars and half of it is YouTube. And I only ever get to discuss this with my fellow creators, so it’s always interesting to me to have these conversations. I am pretty obsessive as far as YouTube creators go. I don’t know anyone else who’s quite as obsessed as me in terms of tracking metrics. And I’m sure there are others, but in terms of car YouTubers, certainly none of them. And so I am able to kind of pinpoint what I believe to be moments in time where there are algorithm shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vnUVan"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always found it a little bit strange. If [YouTube] told us a little bit more about the algorithm, we would probably be able to create content that better served it, but they don’t do that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TrAhsm"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicize it. They don’t want you to know. There are a couple reasons. It’s a proprietary algorithm, they don’t want you to know what it is. But I’ve always found it a little bit strange. If they told us a little bit more about the algorithm, we would probably be able to create content that better served it, but they don’t do that. And so anyway, the point is I noticed these shifts and I noticed them with other creators. I pay a lot of attention to what other people are doing, what kind of views they’re getting. And so for the one that we’re talking about, I had started a second channel to do some more creative content because it became clear to me that sort of lesser-viewed videos would pull down your more-viewed videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QyyeB"&gt;And what I’ve learned, in what I believe to be a recent algorithm shift, was that’s not true anymore. And maybe the algorithm is a little bit more advanced now, and it can detect these videos that are lesser and kind of distinguish between them and the bigger ones. Although I should note, I’m still kind of workshopping that and I’m not sure that’s true. I still need to look at some more data to come up with that conclusion, but that’s what it’s looked like to me. And so, I don’t know, you just have to pay close attention and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOC1wv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say you’re obsessed about tracking. What are the metrics you’re tracking? Is it view counts? Is it drop-offs? Is it minutes watched?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9WMgF"&gt;It’s a lot of different stuff. It’s changed over the years with the algorithm. A couple of years ago, the first five hours was everything. Within the first five hours, I could tell you how popular the video was going to be. That’s changed completely. The algorithm no longer rewards the instant success. It kind of builds over time. And so I tracked that for a long time. The first five hours was everything and the loss rate between hour one and two and three and four. What I’ve learned now is that the one-week number for views is a really, really good metric. And the change between the next morning and the one week is a really good metric. How much is it kind of growing in that time, that now is sort of the metric for me, that it’s going to be a more successful video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zf9K6H"&gt;But I also track a lot of other stuff, revenue and watch time. One thing I’ve been interested in recently is that YouTube has provided a new metric, which is you can see where in your video people drop off, like at exactly what point. And I found that tremendously interesting. “Oh, here’s what people don’t want to see.” “Here’s what they want to see more of.” You will even see sometimes videos actually increase in the middle of the video, presumably because people have been linked or something and it’s like, “Oh, well maybe that should have been sooner to hook more people or whatever.” And that is really interesting stuff. They give you so much data that you can peruse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gEmlT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s really interesting about this is, it is true, you seem like the most data-informed YouTuber that I’ve talked to … but for someone who makes something with a format that you’ve just described as kind of rigid, where would you see any of those data learnings coming through as a viewer of the channel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJE5b6"&gt;The biggest way to see it is the vehicles that I choose to review. It is very clear to me that certain types of vehicles do a lot better than others and even certain vehicles’ country of origin. And that heavily informs the decisions that I make about which vehicles to review. I’ve always told people and I believe deeply, if it was up to me, my entire channel would be ‘80s and ‘90s weird cars that were too high-tech for their time. I just did a review on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcKjCzd4Pyw"&gt;Nissan Maxima from 1986&lt;/a&gt; that talked to you, like when the door was open, it would say, “The door is open.” Ridiculous. And I would love to review more cars like that but my metrics tell me that actually people don’t really want that all that much, they want new cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrVq8j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of SUVs and family cars on your channel. Is that the connection between the metrics and what people are buying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F99oWt"&gt;Yeah, for sure. And obviously there is an ad rate connection there too. As much as I love to do videos with weird European cars, it’s the regular American cars like the Cadillac Escalade or Chevy Tahoe that just make all the money. You can get half the views and make the same money with a video like that because the ads can target in-market car shoppers, Americans looking for these cars, and Canadians. So that’s what pays the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRXBtV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your ads come through the YouTube partner program or do you sell them direct? How does that revenue work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQDec0"&gt;Yeah, all through YouTube ads. That’s what I use the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C17maH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your channel is a huge success. You were able to leverage it into launching another kind of business entirely — and I do want to talk about that — but the actual mechanics of how a YouTube channel works, where the money comes from, who’s getting the splits, and how predictable it is. They are just a black box for everyone on every side of the equation. And I’m always curious, like how big is your team that makes the channel with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z36WwK"&gt;I make all the scheduling, I write the script, I film the video, and then I have an editor whose name is Nick and he’s the best, and he edits them. Now I was editing my own videos up until a year ago and it just got too time-consuming with Cars and Bids. I actually really love editing the videos. It’s kind of a fun puzzle to put it all together and make it all work. But it takes about four hours to edit a video and I just don’t have time anymore. But that’s it and then I post it, and I’m the one who kind of solely analyzes all the data — and my best friend also answers my emails. And that’s it. That’s the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9aOAv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t have a business manager or business development person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7urBE"&gt;No. None of that stuff. I learned early on one of the key ways I think to do well on YouTube, especially financially, is keep the overhead low and people don’t want, necessarily, super high-quality stuff with seven camera angles. I think part of the appeal of my channel is I’m a guy who gets in a lot of cars and tells you about cars. I’m not necessarily like some crazy professional that leads you to wonder, “This stuff is so good, can I really trust it?” I’m  just a guy and that’s really who I feel like I am. I just show up and start pushing buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUkz1g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel that. I asked our video team for their questions for you and a lot of the questions were about video creation. Like are you shooting everything on iPhones? GoPros? What does that look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYP8Jf"&gt;Anytime you see me in the shot, I have a Sony 4K camcorder that I use. Anytime you see a button being pressed or a window rolling down, that is all shot on my iPhone. And what’s funny about that is people get upset. They see it occasionally in a video – I catch a reflection. I try to keep it out of the way, but sometimes it’s not possible. If you’re filming a mirror, you have to see the iPhone. And I get angry people in the comments, “How can you do this, you have this many viewers, on an iPhone? You need to upgrade your camera.” And I want to be like, “Hey dude, you’ve been watching for three years and you’re just noticing.” It doesn’t matter, right? So it’s just great quality, that stuff is great quality. Now it could be better obviously, but it couldn’t be a million times better. Like it’s good enough that it’s watchable for pretty much everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6xkfR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Apple rolls out new iPhone camera features, does that blow up your workflow? When they say  “It has HDR now,” do you think, “Crap, what does that mean for me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YFNeg"&gt;I am a tech person in the sense that I love certain gadgets, but I’m not a huge tech person. I do buy the new iPhones immediately because typically now the upgrades to the phone are camera-related. The stabilizing stuff was so big, that changed everything. That was what really enabled me to go to the iPhone for a lot of shots because you really can’t tell. It’s more stabilized than my stupid camcorder, which costs a ton more money. And the quality is so good. iPhone camera updates are a big deal in the Doug world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2sTiq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I’m honestly curious. When the iPhone 12 came out last year &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it added HDR video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I remember we had a conversation with our video team, “What does this mean for us? How will our workflow change?” And then we sort of had this side conversation, “Oh man, what’s Doug going to do?” Like, “Are all the Doug videos going to be in HDR now?” So do you turn that stuff off? Do you reinvent your workflow? Are you thinking about it ahead of time or are you just kind of seeing how it goes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yFXJP"&gt;No, not really. And it’ll blow you away, but I pretty much use the default settings that come straight out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9fkUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I mean, all of this stuff is super interesting to me because one of our theses on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is that your distribution platform really affects what you make.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And in this case that also means your capture platform changes what you make. So stabilization in the phone lets you make a different kind of video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="morgSN"&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATNURM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you connect that to distribution? Do you think, “Oh man, a lot of people are going to watch this on the same phone I’m capturing on.” Or “YouTube stats tell me lots more people are watching YouTube on TVs now, I should make something that will work on a TV”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBkbO9"&gt;That’s an interesting question. And I did switch to 4K. I was one of the earlier YouTubers to switch to 4K in part for that reason but mainly because I realized, people are watching on big screens now and you can get away with that stuff. And in fact, one of the things that I’m really a little disappointed about is the quality of some of my earlier videos. This is before anyone was doing 4K, before there was a period where you couldn’t even do that on YouTube. I did some great cars and they look kind of crappy — the camera quality is crappy. And there was not much I could do about that. Even then, there wasn’t much I could’ve done. But I look back now and I’m like, “Damn, I wish the F-40 was in 4K.” People are watching this on TVs today, the screens are huge, people want to see super high quality. But you know, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxXd8K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I’m reviewing something I want to spend a week with it. And I rarely get that, especially when there’s a video involved. I get the thing in my hand and a member of the video team is in my back pocket asking, “Are you ready? Are you done? What do you think?” I’m like, “I just got it.” How long do you get to spend with a car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4KzyJ"&gt;When I first started, I was militant about not taking press cars, because I thought that there was some kind of quid pro quo in the industry there. I still feel that way. But you do realize, when the press cars come and you have them for a week, as opposed to going to a guy’s house and reviewing the car for an afternoon, you learn a lot more about the product that way. And it is nice to get the stuff for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hGQmDH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People get mad at me because I don’t do my reviews on a racetrack ... But people don’t really use the car that way. They think they need that information, but they really don’t.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RuQL7a"&gt;On average, when it’s a press car, I do generally get a week with it. When I’m just shooting a car at a dealer or whatever, I shoot it in a day. I’ve made something like 600 videos. So I’m pretty good at figuring out what to look for, and knowing what’s going to be good, and what’s going to be bad. And I can drive a car for a short amount of time and decide, “Okay, is this part of the driving experience good, bad, whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiGktO"&gt;People get mad at me because I don’t do my reviews on a racetrack. And that would be nice to really experience the car at the limit and really find out if the M3 is better than the whatever, 911, I don’t know. But people don’t really use the car that way. They think they need that information, but they really don’t. They want to know, “Is it going to feel great on my regular commute?” And I can figure that stuff out pretty quickly, but yeah, the more time, the better. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAUIyp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I think about as a reviewer — versus other kinds of stuff you can do with new products — is that my goal is to help people make a purchase decision. I’m basically saying, “Is this worth the money or not?” And there’s lots of different ways to evaluate that. There’s lots of different ways to make the case that something is or is not worth the money. There’s lots of different ways to connect things like antitrust policy or chip shortages. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZReHsm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can connect a lot of things down to, “Is this worth the money for you?” Is that how you approach your reviews? Or is it, “Hey, I got to just generate a Doug score at the end of this video,” and you can think about all that stuff on your own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chO9BH"&gt;No, that is it. At least when I review new cars, or nearly new cars, that is my goal. And it’s actually kind of a weird thing. It’s a little bit difficult because there’s precisely two types of people who watch my channel. There’s enthusiasts who watch every video. And then there’s people who just stumble across videos here and there because they’re looking for a car. And trying to please both of those audiences in one video is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WM8Z5W"&gt;People don’t realize how tough that is. People will email me and be like, “This is the third time you’ve mentioned this on BMWs in the last year.” And it’s like, “Well, some people, they didn’t watch the M4 video and they’re only watching the X5 video because they’re not interested in M4.” That is the really tough part about being the product reviewer and the entertainer at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDtOPM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re writing your scripts, how long does it take you to write a script for one of these videos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2v5H4O"&gt;The script is only the part you see with me standing next to the car. For everything else I make a shot list on my phone as I’m going through the car and pushing all the buttons. So the script is just a few lines of background. “This is a whatever, and it comes with this engine and it came out this year,” and that kind of stuff. And that doesn’t take long, just a little bit of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbdSBt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start to finish then, is it, you said four hours to edit and a day to shoot? Is it two days? I mean, this is incredible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ME8hh"&gt;I can shoot a video in say, four or five hours. Plus the script is probably another hour, just to do the research, background, it’s an hour or two. And then editing it takes about four hours. And then that’s it. Plus travel time to get to the places where the cars are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFarxK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see that split in your audience? You probably have kind of a big, long-tail audience of one-and-dones, or search is finding you. And then you’ve got people who ring the bell, in YouTube parlance, who are watching every video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hga0mM"&gt;The videos that are the real home runs are the ones where you get both. So &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qen0ZlZM0ZA&amp;amp;t=460s"&gt;I put up Tesla Model S Plaid today&lt;/a&gt;, and that will get both. That will get the people who are interested in a Plaid, or any electric car, probably. And also my longtime subscribers who want to see every video. And those are the ones that they really blow up. But yes, otherwise, it’s bizarre. I’ll put up a video on a certain weird quirky car, and that will only be the Doug subscriber loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX1w9R"&gt;And then the next day, I’ll put up a video on a RAV4 that people are interested in buying and all the people from the prior day are gone. And the RAV4 video won’t get any views right away. But over time, as people search the car, and Google the car, that video rises up and probably eventually actually surpasses the quirky Doug car video because of so many in-market shoppers. It’s a bigger audience than the quirky Doug people. But yeah, that’s a weird one for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPHAH7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you map that back to your revenue? You said the channel is your biggest income stream. Are you ever thinking, “Man, I hope the car industry puts out more mid-range SUVs this month.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBb65N"&gt;No, I don’t have to worry about that. The car industry is doing just fine. Truthfully, if I wanted to, I could change the channel so that it was only new car reviews of cars people are going to buy. And probably I would earn more money and I’d probably get a little bit more views — but that’s dull. And so I don’t need to review the Volkswagen Tiguan after I already reviewed the CX5 and the Ford Escape. And it’s tiring. But no, I truly believe the car industry has so many new models that I could just review new cars and be completely 100 percent fine. But I like to do the weird stuff, and people would complain if I just did new stuff too. So I like to keep them coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGNcp1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I very much enjoyed the review of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UQ3ym2HXZA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Oldsmobile Silhouette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which my uncle had. And when I watched it I thought, “I knew this was a mistake when I was 13, I’m 100 percent sure it’s a mistake now.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q77gOk"&gt;Did his have the power sliding door?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8i0Ps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes. He drove it to all of our houses so we could see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TPkZO"&gt;That back then was the most legit luxury feature any of us had ever seen in a family car. Remember? It played the little noise, the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awl4YM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I remember the noise. I also remembered what that car looked like. And seeing it again in 4K, because I think that video is in 4K, I was like, “Yep, it still looks bad.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIyQXb"&gt;Well, here’s a little behind-the-scenes on that video. That car was on its literal last legs. And in fact, if you look closely in some of the shots you can see that I filmed it in a junkyard. If you look close enough at some of the shots you can see it. And I am certain that at the end of that video, the dude junked it. And that was its final swan song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrFBdB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s amazing. You talked about lots of cars coming out. You mentioned the Tiguan, Volkswagen has 9,000 SUVs that all look the same in slightly different sizes — it’s like they’re just pinching the zoom on the same design. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZMhKR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of cars seem to run the same operating system inside and they have the same button layouts. As a reviewer, are you seeing software just eat the car the way that it’s sort of eating everything else, and the cars are getting similar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXOmAH"&gt;Yeah. But it’s still really manufacturer-dependent. And so it hasn’t been a problem for me too much yet. Some of the Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini — those are all under the same roof now — they pretty much run very similar software. Those are a little bit more difficult to distinguish, but it is in the brand’s best interest to make sure the cars are relatively distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgUFwN"&gt;And so each car generally has enough differences, and they tend to come out with enough gap that if I’ve reviewed the Audi A8, and then the A6 comes out with similar tech, usually they’re 18 months apart or something and by then, it’s time for a refresher anyway so I could do all that stuff again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E71CEB"&gt;I was worried about that as screens started to become the thing and yeah, software started to become a thing, but I haven’t noticed any drop in views, even on cars where I reviewed sort of a similar thing twice in the same year. Last year was the big year Audi came out with RS7, and RS6, and RS5, and RSQ8. There were all these new Audis, and I reviewed them all. And they all had about the same stuff inside, but they all did well. I think people are interested in watching the video about the one that they want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE2Cjt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I asked because I think about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; stuff, which is often, “Here’s a computer inside the car. It’s slowly extending its tentacles everywhere.” I watch all kinds of car reviews. I watch a lot of yours. A lot of people just gesture at the center screen and say, “It has CarPlay and Android Auto,” and then they move on because honestly, that’s what people are using. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaLCtW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But do you think, as somebody who sees all these cars, is the industry doing a good job of getting away from the “put your phone on the screen” mentality? Because they need to get away from it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEOs of car companies come on this show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and admit they need to get away from it. But everyone who reviews cars still ends up saying, “It has CarPlay and Android Auto. We’re moving on to what’s actually cool.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v49lar"&gt;Yeah, I do. I think it’s interesting. This isn’t quite a direct answer, but you’ve hit on a very interesting point, which I think about a lot. Car reviewers are not great tech reviewers. And frankly, I think vice versa too, but that’s a different conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SpGzy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shots fired, dude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YZyQm"&gt;Not always, not always. But I’m sure you agree with me. You’ve seen some tech reviewers review some cars. But car reviewers, I think, are actually worse at being tech reviewers, in part because of the car industry. Those people are into it because of the sound they make or whatever. And a lot of times, they’re just bad at going through the tech. In more and more of these cars, the tech is a huge component, like an absolutely massive component of it. And car reviewers like to gloss over that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5XpKya"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Car reviewers are not great tech reviewers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YoxA46"&gt;And yeah, it’s become super easy for them to be like, “Oh, it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay,” and they move on. Well, cars have a lot more depth to that than their infotainment. And the problem is that users use them in a lot more ways and it does require more in-depth information that they’re not getting. And actually, I think in that sense, tech reviewers are way better car reviewers than car reviewers that are reviewing cars. And I think a lot of car reviewers need to watch out, because that’s going to become more and more of the car, and tech reviewers are going to gain a higher and higher level of advantage. … Car reviewers need to realize that the tech is a big reason people are buying a car now, it’s the software, the tech, the infotainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2wMer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I think a lot of the marketing that’s been around self-driving is you’re going to get in this car, and it’s going to go where you want it to go, and you’ll be in a world of screens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eL0c7n"&gt;Right. And you’ll be able to do stuff on these screens. And thus, the screens are really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDhdil"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whereas I don’t think we’re anywhere close to that, but the way some of that’s expressed now is, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313111/jeep-2022-wagoneer-amazon-fire-tv-integrated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the new Jeep Grand Wagoneer runs Fire OS in the backseat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And you have to know something about Amazon’s TV strategy to tell people whether or not the screen in the back of a Jeep is any good. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGxQ2D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is a huge collision. And there are huge business decisions that were made. They partnered with Amazon as opposed to Google to run Chromecast or whatever. And that to me feels like a level of complexity added to a car review that might turn you away from quirks and features like, “Here’s the light design. Here’s where all the logos are,” to, “Now I’m walking you through an interface of a Fire TV in the back of an SUV.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuzGRe"&gt;I do get complaints when I go too much into the infotainment, because I get really into it. When I get into a car that has fully new infotainment technology — I just did the new Mercedes S-Class the other day —  I’m really into that, but I have to walk it back a little because people get upset if you go through too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccp63w"&gt;I’ve always felt that as cars get more screen-focused, it’ll actually help me because I focus more on the quirks and features and less on the driving experience. These screens are now offering some wild quirks. Tesla’s got video games in the damn cars. That’s insane. I was in a Chrysler Pacifica, I think, where YouTube was built in. Baby Shark has its own app in the rear seat DVD entertainment. There’s all this crazy stuff in cars, and in car tech and in screens. And I’m here for it. Bring on the weird stuff because it’s just more quirks to talk about. And that’s what people seem to really love. I love that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2wDap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about helping people make a purchase decision. I look at all the screens. I look at EVs. I’m like, “Oh crap. These things are smartphones on wheels. I should never buy a car again. I should only lease a car and I should just trade it in every three years, the same way that I trade in my iPhone.” Do you see that from your viewership? Is that reflected in how you evaluate the purchase decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykzP5f"&gt;It’s certainly more and more how I’m feeling about new cars, but it’s not how everybody feels for sure. And especially because most people still haven’t even come close to making the transition to EVs — but there are a lot of screens and stuff. But out-of-warranty ownership of some of these vehicles is not the world I want to live in. I don’t know about my viewers. I don’t know that it would matter that much to my channel, because whether you’re leasing the car and then ditching it or buying it to hold, you still want to know the new stuff, what’s cool, what’s interesting. So I don’t know that it would matter that much to my channel, but I do think that more people are going in the direction you’re talking about as far as leasing. And improvements are made so quickly and so dramatically that I get it, who wants to buy a car? If you lease you can get it for a little while. And some of these leases are so heavily subsidized by tax breaks and such, especially for electric cars, that you can’t not lease them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUW6kz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think about software updates? Tesla has this full self-driving beta. That is a loaded term that we should talk about, but when there is a software update do you think, “Crap. I got to review the car again?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BStfF"&gt;No, I generally won’t re-review because usually there’s another car from that automaker coming down the line that I can review. But I do think about how the videos I make are not current for that long, when you really think about it. Maybe you can get three good years. But typically, at that point, the automaker is doing something else that makes me want to re-review the car anyway, like there’s a full redesign, or a big facelift, or a performance model comes out. And I can kind of sneak some of the new stuff into a review of that car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUcRBY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We spend a lot of time on the show talking about big tech; Apple, Google, Facebook. They’re in the cars, in some ways, with Android Auto and CarPlay. You obviously built your business on a Google platform. How have you seen all this collide? How has big tech shaped this industry? It seems like it’s shaped it in a lot of ways and no one has ever taken a step back and said, “This is what the industry looks like now.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4f08Q"&gt;Yeah. That’s an interesting point. In terms of taking a step back, I don’t really think about it holistically. Tech has shaped this industry. I think about 10 years ago, my Ford GT has no screen in it. In theory, you could turn your phone on airplane mode, get in that car, and no one would know where you are. Right? Now it’s insane. I record the videos on an Apple iPhone. I make all the money on a Google platform. The big tech has owned an enormous amount of every space, but of the car space as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeXJQS"&gt; And I think it’s only going to continue to increase. And Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is absolutely essential for most people in cars. It’s crazy. And like we were talking about earlier, I think a lot of traditional car people aren’t ready for this, or they weren’t ready for it. And they’re now either curmudgeonly going with the flow or new cars are leaving them behind. But it is pretty crazy how the tech world has taken over a lot of worlds, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddrOlh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So now you gotta answer. Which carmaker is doing the best and which carmaker is doing the worst?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zK3tnV"&gt;In terms of tech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZVcIL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luC6Ca"&gt;Not a popular answer, but I truly believe Mercedes-Benz has the best in-car tech. The MBUX system is amazing. It really works incredibly well. It’s fantastic. In terms of driver assist, Mercedes is also great there. Chrysler is also good, believe it or not. I was in a Jeep the other day that had amazingly good driver assist. And Tesla, truthfully, Tesla has great driver assist tech. I don’t think Tesla’s infotainment tech is quite at the top anymore, but I would put it right up there behind MBUX for the very best. But there’s a lot of great systems on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwvWmr"&gt;It’s kind of funny. Everybody says there are no bad cars anymore, which is kind of true. All cars are pretty good. They get good mileage, they’re safe, but there is bad tech in cars, and that’s the new frontier. You can get in some cars, you touch screens, and you have to wait after pushing a button. It’s a millisecond, but it’s not a tenth of a millisecond, so you’re upset. But generally I think that the luxury brands do a really good job, but I think specifically Mercedes-Benz is great. Tesla has some great stuff. Some of the cars are not quite as strong. Honestly, exotic cars are bad, Ferrari’s new tech is kind of a disaster. But yeah, I would say those two are probably the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky29Cu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; You were careful to call it driver assist there. I know there’s a little controversy in your world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3j1Rw"&gt;I’ve gotten called out on that, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfrqRI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a fight for every reviewer between the marketing, the reality of tech, the marketing of how tech works, and they often diverge. And then there’s what people just call stuff. And this is for every product, for every marketing decision. How have you landed on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLsRV0"&gt;I much prefer to say self-driving, as in “the Cadillac CT6 has this great self-driving feature,” because truthfully, if you talk to humans, any non-tech person or non-car reviewer, that’s how they know it. And I think in the end, the lexicon is going to probably win out. That will probably beat this movement to call it driver assist, but I have gotten called out for it. And so I’m very careful these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQPQrw"&gt;I call it driver assist. It is not self-driving. I’ll use those terms for now because I have to, but I do think there’s a lot of things in the world that aren’t quite what we call them, but that’s what they are. And I think that’s how people think of it, truthfully. You get in the car, the steering wheel turns itself, and it’s going and stopping and starting. To most people, that’s it. That’s self-driving. That’s all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BibAqF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s funny because the episode before this is my interview with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627847/argo-ai-bryan-salesky-decoder-interview-lyft-self-driving"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the CEO of a self-driving company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. He’s like, “We’re nowhere near there yet.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TD9daP"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cg9LbG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. And I think that gap is interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b62tKq"&gt;That is a good point. They’re not truly at the level that they would consider self-driving, but talk to your nephew, talk to your friend, right? You sit in a car and the steering wheel starts turning going around a curve and they’re like, “Holy crap, this thing drives itself.” That’s what they’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5wJGz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mom has a Mercedes that can do some of that. And she’s like, “F this. I will never trust it.” And then my sister has a Tesla Model 3 that can do some of that. And she’s like, “This is all I want in the world.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2r5ZzK"&gt;It’s all I want in the world. It’s so funny. Car enthusiasts are behind. I drive to LA twice a week to film. And in Southern California, driving from LA to San Diego, that’s a nightmare. With no traffic, it’s an hour and a half. With traffic, it can be four hours. Driving in a car that has good driver assist technology is crucial. My ultimate goal is to just answer emails. I love my Ford GT and I drive that on the weekends and I have so much fun — I just took it out before this, it was great — but in traffic, I want to answer emails and scroll Instagram. That’s what I want to do. And so I think car enthusiasts say they’ll never buy a self-driving car. But they’re wrong. It has a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbEevl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I think the second they can actually do it and that steering wheel goes away, the entire industry will change in dramatic and catastrophic ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8zcLo"&gt;Is your mom’s problem with it, do you think she’s too old to comprehend it or she’s scared of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSZEoz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She doesn’t trust it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And I think there’s just a generational trust of computers making decisions. And I don’t even know if that generational trust maps to age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2dm3q"&gt;Yeah. Yeah. True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxpHxB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have friends who don’t even use their cruise control.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They say “I want to drive the car,” and they’re my age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StMesu"&gt;It’s like boomer is a mentality, not an age. Right. It’s that same sort of thing. Yeah. That’s probably true. That’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IoUdN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like you brought up Tesla, so now we have to talk about Tesla. Tesla is this disruptive force in the auto industry. Do you get the Tesla stans? Whenever we review a car on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; like the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and we call out the parts that are good and the parts that are bad — all of our comments are just by Tesla people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CR2eoJ"&gt;The Tesla people are insane. I’ve never quite seen anything like it. On Twitter, they’re so insane. I mean, I get just crazy — well, not death threats, it’s not that level — but they just accuse me of being wrong about stuff that hasn’t come out yet or that’s years away, based on the promises of a CEO, which I just find so weird. ... And it’s also funny. Their anger is purely based on what I’ve said most recently about Tesla. I named the Model 3 Performance my Car of the Year in 2019. And I was every Tesla person’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOTzCg"&gt;But then I said that I think the Cybertruck is ugly, and stupid, and it’s not going to be sold like this, and it’s going to be bad compared to other trucks. People lost it. Then I was the worst. Well, just now I put out the Model Y video that was very complimentary, and that put me back in their good graces. And it’s kind of funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6YCyW"&gt;They’re so obsessed with the day’s story. And I think that’s in part because a lot of these people who are that obsessed have a big financial incentive. I think a lot of people own the stock and are paying very close attention to the hype that helps drive the stock. I don’t live in that world. I review the cars. I try to be as objective as possible. The Plaid was amazing, but it has drawbacks and I try to talk about all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHILKp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actually, right before we came on, you said you think of yourself as a journalist. There’s a Venn diagram of being a journalist, of being a YouTuber, of being an influencer, of being an entrepreneur on YouTube. Tell me why you say you’re a journalist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgEL0L"&gt;I consider myself to be more of a journalist than an entertainer. I’m doing product reviews. A lot of in-market car shoppers are basing decisions, or at least partially basing decisions, off what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWyFpL"&gt;And so I consider myself mostly to be a journalist. The automakers are the most interesting when it comes to this question. They vary in how they consider us. Some of them call me a journalist and they want to get the product to me as soon as possible for a review, just like the magazines. Some of them don’t want to work with YouTubers. They don’t care. They see us as influencers still. And I’m like, “Listen, an enormous portion of your buyers are using videos like this to buy cars.” And they haven’t got there yet. It’s an interesting mix about the legitimacy of this career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McTiVH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I say “I’m a journalist,” what I tend to mean is there’s a tiny link on every &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; page that says &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ethics-statement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ethics statement,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and you can click it. And that will tell you, we don’t have stock in Tesla — I’m not allowed to own any. We can’t take things for free. And if we do take review samples, we have to give them back, and on and on and on. Is that what you’re trying to communicate? Is that from your time at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, how does that play out for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWBKnW"&gt;I’m militant about stuff like that. So for years I didn’t take press cars. When COVID hit, my wife and I were trying to get pregnant, and I just couldn’t go into car dealers because we felt we had a little bit of a higher risk. So I started taking more press cars and that’s kind of continued. I would say, now, a third of the cars that are reviewed are delivered to my house and I film them and they’re from the automaker. But other than that, yeah, I don’t have any stock in any automaker in any capacity ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4TqDy"&gt;I’m very cautious about press trips. All of my journalist compatriots go on free press trips. This is something that not everybody is aware of, but I’m sure you are. The automaker pays to fly the journalist, often business class, to whatever city they’re having an event. They put them up in a beautiful hotel and they give them this amazing experience. Often, they do one day as a driving day of the car, but then the second day is like an adventure at a theme park, or a private tour of something. Then you’re supposed to go home and write an objective review of this product. I think that shit’s crazy. I don’t know if I’m allowed to say that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SpTzb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re definitely allowed to say that. We’re keeping that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGuyHN"&gt;I think that stuff is crazy. When I go on press trips, I pay my own way, and I think I’m the only car journalist right now who’s doing it. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; used to also do it, but they stopped reviewing cars, probably because it was so costly to have to do all that stuff. But I’ll put myself up in a Days Inn a couple of miles away. I don’t want to be involved in any of that stuff. I make good money from YouTube and I don’t want anybody to ever accuse me of, “Oh, you took some $400 flight, you’re biased.” It’s like, no, I can do it all myself just to be completely free of that kind of stuff. But be careful when you watch car reviews or frankly, any product reviews, but especially cars, because you have to get the person to the thing, it’s very different than when a company can just send you a product. And I find that to be so ethically troublesome, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz8cVJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, that’s our policy too, you can go read it. What’s funny is the two industries where it’s the worst, the car industry and the camera industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAgkmw"&gt;Oh, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFAZ4V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you review cameras, a camera company will be like, “Would you like to come to Iceland and use the camera to take pictures of an iceberg?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXHvef"&gt;I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuhdLt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it’s like, “No, dude, just give us a camera. It’s small, you can just send it to us.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYyz3K"&gt;That’s what I always tell the automakers about cars. I just got an invite to go drive the new Ford Maverick in Nashville. And they probably have some country music-themed thing that you get to go to — just bring the car to my damn house. I’ll drive it around my neighborhood where I usually drive, and then I’ll review the car. I don’t want the special treatment because there might be a day when you make something that I want to review negatively. And when that day comes, I don’t want to sit there and say, “Boy, if I review this negatively, I’m not going to get to go on that next trip. They’re going to cut me off from getting that next car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nFX5f"&gt;And so I’ve also always maintained very close relationships with car dealerships. I just had an incident this week where an automaker told me no, they wouldn’t let me review a certain car, and I called up a dealer and I’m reviewing it tomorrow anyway. And I’m cool with that, so if an automaker thinks I’ve said too many negative things, fine, I’ve got other sources, I’ll figure it out. But the other guys don’t always do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bf5nXu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, I feel like a part of that comes because you started at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; which was militant about that stuff too. Do you think that’s where it comes from and that’s maybe why the other car YouTubers don’t do it that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1Lls8"&gt;Yeah, that, but also because at the same time I was working for &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;, I was working for another publication where we would go on the trips. And we all kind of thought it was stupid. But I saw the stupidity firsthand when the guy from the &lt;em&gt;Schenectady Eagle&lt;/em&gt; is getting flown out to Palm Springs to review some new supercar. And I’m like, “How is this happening? I can’t believe this is so gross. I just don’t trust these things anymore.” And you mentioned the camera industry, don’t you think the travel industry is probably the same? Like hotels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BABPq7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, I feel like once you go into real lifestyle, like hotels, tourism, that stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="692MnR"&gt;I only look at Google reviews for that stuff. I don’t buy any professional reviews. They’re all lying to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChOQKD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luxury handbags, just down the line. But I feel like that coverage is tinged with a hint of absurdity. I know some of those writers and they know, it comes through, that fundamentally this whole cycle is ridiculous. And the luxury handbag, it couldn’t murder you the way a car can.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sS1SDa"&gt;That’s true. That’s true. And when you read it, it does come through in the pros. It’s like, “Yeah, this is ridiculous, but whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o87Ra8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kind of an important intersection here with YouTube is brand deals. There is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22636827/youtube-partner-program-2-million-members-creators"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a YouTube partner program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, that’s where you’re making a bunch of your money, but there are brand deals too. People want to do integrations. I’ve seen some of those ads that you’ve done. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbFGA3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re your own business manager. One of the lines for us is we have a sales team. I know they’re often irritated with me, but they’re off doing their thing and there’s a wall between our newsroom and sales. You don’t have that wall. Do you feel the pressure there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2VXZ"&gt;Yeah,  I almost never do those. So I’ve only done four in the entire time I’ve done this. And there’s a reason for that. And the main reason is  because I feel like I’m a journalist reviewing these products, in order for me to have an objective, nonbiased standard, I think it’s bad for the videos to have a stupid ad at the start, especially because you can just tell some of these guys are so hollow the way they introduce it like, “You should check out this watch,” or whatever. And it’s like they’re so obviously not believing in it, they’re just reading a script. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tutCIs"&gt;So I don’t get involved, I don’t like to do a lot of them, but at the same time, I look at everybody else doing them every video. And I’m like, “Well, here and there, I should do one.” And so if it’s a product that I’ve used or a product that I like, I will occasionally do them. But yeah, I don’t like doing that stuff. And also, I think the real key, the real important reason I don’t do those kind of things, and I like to believe this is true, is I’ve always felt that if I do those, I get more money up front, but I think long-term, people get annoyed with the content and I think people question your objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JVuj6"&gt;I think one of the reasons that I’ve been able to remain near the top in cars is because I don’t do those brand deals. And people believe the stuff I’m telling them and don’t think I’m getting paid off. And I think that that’s a really, really important standard to maintain. And so, yes, I know my colleagues are making more from those ads than they will for the whole video no matter how long it’s up and I’m not getting that. But I’ve been at this for eight years, I think that that longevity is rare on YouTube and it’s kind of proven that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ot5MuN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That kind of leads into sustainability. You obviously have pretty low overhead. You’re doing well. Is your YouTube revenue sustainable, can you keep doing it for a long time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQxQKe"&gt;Yeah, and I think with new cars, it’s interesting. Something I hadn’t even considered is the difference between a YouTuber who does lifestyle content and product reviews until I went on the MKBHD podcast and Marques brought that up. It was something I had never even thought of. Some of the lifestyle influencers fall off the face of the earth because people get tired of them. People will surely get tired of me, but at the end of the day, I’m doing product reviews. The product is the new thing, not the lifestyle thing, the weird new thing you decided to do that day for views. And so I think as long as I can do product reviews, I think it’ll sustain. I hope so for a long time, that’s the dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeCVDQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we had MKBHD on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and we had a version of the same conversation and he was like, “Look, it’s pretty hard for me to get in trouble like some of the other YouTubers. I’m just like, ‘Here’s a new phone.’ I don’t swear. And that’s enough to keep me in the pocket.” I think that’s pretty fascinating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1JUfl"&gt;It is fascinating. And whenever I watch some of these people, I think to myself, like, “Oh my gosh, that could happen to me.” My personality comes through in the videos to an extent but at the end of the day, yeah, I’m doing a car review. I think in some sense it’s easier to do a product review because I hear a lot about the pressure to come up with content from my fellow YouTubers and I have the opposite problem. I have too much content. I have the pressure of scheduling everything and actually getting everything filmed and that sort of thing. And I definitely would rather be in my position than trying to come up with something new every day or every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eB3OTa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you worry about burnout? Because that’s something I hear from creators all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XapThE"&gt;Yeah, I worry about it, but it’s never happened. Like I told you before, every time I go to film a car, I’m so excited. I am terrified that one day I’m going to show up and be like, “This sucks. I don’t want to do this.” But it has never happened and I’ve been doing it for a long time. So I don’t know. Yeah, maybe someday I’ll get burned out. I do worry about it because I hear about other creators feeling it and I also think for a lot of creators, you can tell when they’ve got to turn out content but they’re not into it. And I’m very lucky that that hasn’t happened for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PW7eIg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way that’s expressed is the algorithm changes and everyone chases the new format and then they burn it out and the algorithm changes again, but with you, you’re like, “Here’s my format. And I’m going to use the data to review different kinds of cars, but the structure is there.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiP6BQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s really interesting about this is that I have this whole series of questions about why you launched Cars and Bids, and baked into them is the assumption that you need to diversify away from YouTube in case there’s burnout or the algorithm kills you — but that doesn’t seem to be the case at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THQhBI"&gt;Well, there’s a couple of things I do see with the algorithm and with YouTube. Views are slowing down and that’s generally true among car YouTubers. There are more of us now and so it seems to me that we’re sharing in it more. When I first started this, the views were definitely stronger. Now interestingly, income is up almost enough to compensate, so it hasn’t really been a problem, but I could see it being a problem. The biggest issue that I have though with YouTube, ultimately, is I’m not in control of any of this stuff. So at the end of the day, they could turn it off tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhZ8UI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The biggest issue that I have though with YouTube, ultimately, is I’m not in control of any of this stuff.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Wdd2k"&gt;It’s obviously not in their best interest to do that, but I still worry. And so yeah, Cars and Bids was born from the desire to diversify. It wasn’t just necessarily a thought that I would lose YouTube or lose the revenue or lose the views, it was also like, I’ve got this platform, I would be stupid if I didn’t take more advantage of it somehow. And so I just felt like I had to. And so it is diversification in a sense, but it was also like, “You’re lucky. No one else has this platform. You should do something with it because otherwise you’re wasting this amazing gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rudFd5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I talk to other creators about diversifying, it’s usually to TikTok or it’s to another platform in some other way. You built a business from the ground up. There are major competitors in that space. What was your decision process that got you to car auctions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hIv3g"&gt;Well, it was clear to me that there was room for more. The biggest competitors, I think, were leaving a little bit of room for more. And also I don’t know, if I had known how hard it was going to be, I don’t know if I would’ve done it. I should’ve just gone on TikTok. I often tell my business partner, “I should have just started a damn podcast.” It would’ve been way easier. But the benefit of this is now that it’s been a year, I don’t feel like we’re safe in this business at any stretch of the imagination, but we’ve proven the concept, it’s working, we’re profitable, we’re running 20 car auctions a day. This works, and the benefit now is, here’s something I actually possess that I could sell or that I could transition to and the channel isn’t really quite like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMu74A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, when we had Marques on the show, he was hinting heavily that he was going to start another channel that other people were on. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG7J20LhUeLl6y_Emi7OJrA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’ve launched that channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You don’t have a B team. There’s not a secondary channel with other car viewers that you’re going to introduce, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn7IFG"&gt;Right, no, I don’t think that that’s a legitimate strategy really, if you’re trying to diversify away from YouTube, you’ve got to look at it and be like, “How is that the smart move,” basically. It seemed to me that the smart move was to create something like this. I didn’t realize that not that many creators had done it until I spoke to more people in the creator space, and the first thing they want to know is how I was able to take my audience and move them to a different thing. It seemed to me to be kind of a logical move. But at the same time, I can look at it and say, “It was and is an enormous undertaking, an enormous amount of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uazku8"&gt;I have my channel, I keep really low overhead; well, Cars and Bids, we have a dozen employees, it’s a whole different ball game. And that was all very, very, very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ckfog4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you launched this in the middle of 2020, obviously the easiest year to launch a business with a dozen employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkOge1"&gt;What were we thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWUqTi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just go for it, man. Did you hire everybody remotely? Do you have an office? How does this work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bH2lH"&gt;No, everybody’s remote. Most of us are in San Diego just by chance. My partner’s here and then a couple of other people. And then we moved a guy out here thinking we’d have an office, but we’ve all agreed that an office is not the way to go. We now have people all over the country. And a couple of our writers are in Europe. But yeah, what were we thinking, launching this business in the COVID? But you know what’s funny, obviously you’ve seen what’s happened in the car world and the home prices, consumer anything, any consumer goods have gone up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCEMKh"&gt;We got lucky. When we launched the business, we had spent so much of our initial costs paying salaries and developing it, that we needed to launch the website because we needed to start making some revenue. And we kind of thought it would fail because we launched it in June of 2020. And it was the worst time in the world to do anything. But obviously it actually turned out to be the perfect time and so it worked out okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaqOJL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have investors? Did you fund the whole thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJrPK6"&gt;No, I didn’t fund the whole thing. I launched it with a company here in San Diego that funds some startups, and we were kind of the first, and then I have a partner who’s my co-founder and it was his company. And so they backed us financially and now that we’re profitable, it’s a big load off. When you take on investors, that’s a big thing you’re thinking about. It’s a lot of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZPyxZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we’re in the heart of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; questions. You mentioned selling it, is that the goal, to sell it and exit, or is it to operate it, or just take profit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaDWt1"&gt;I honestly don’t know. I don’t come from a startup world. I don’t know anybody in my entire life personally who’s ever founded a startup. So I don’t live in that world. And so that wasn’t even something I was thinking about when we were starting this, which now seems ridiculous. The answer is it just depends on what happens. I would be happy to run it forever and make good money, or sell it if the right offer comes along. I truly and honestly don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Noqiww"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I say the heart of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; questions, we’re in it now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEEHp4"&gt;Go ahead, feel free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nob2Wf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your org chart like? Do you have a ton of management responsibilities and individuals in addition to making videos? How much extra work did you actually take on here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcjxWC"&gt;No, a lot. One of the stupidest things I ever did was decide that I should write my opinion of each car in each auction. And so now I’m writing 20 of these a day. This is truly the stupidest thing I ever did. It’s not scalable at all. And I don’t know what we’re going to do, but yeah, it’s a lot more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJvdui"&gt;And it’s important to me to put out a product that’s really super high quality, which is kind of funny if you watch my videos, because they’re sort of amateurish, but it’s really important to me. I wanted to launch this and make it damn good. And so I’m pretty involved trying to make sure when stuff is misspelled, I kind of get on my team like, “This can’t happen.” When the spacing is not right or words are wrong, that irks me. And I’m there every single day. Most of what I do in a day now is Cars and Bids stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC5rCs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The submission form is pretty involved. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.carsandbids.com/CarsAndBids-Photo-Guide.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to submit like 100 photos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Do you have a lot of experience buying and selling cars at auction? Or is this a clean sheet — this is what it should be like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT7LcR"&gt;I have a lot of experience buying and selling cars. The auction part is difficult because you basically have seven days to make a decision, these people on these cars. But I’ll tell you something —  some of these people are submitting 300 photos and videos and a description and they’re spending a week answering questions and you’ve got the Carfax. At the end of the day, there’s not a lot more you’re going to uncover from all that stuff. You’ve got service history for some of these cars. Having the auctions last for a week gives you the opportunity to pursue an inspection beforehand if you want. You can kind of organize that when the car lists before it sells. So I don’t know, it’s tough for people, but yeah, we distill down what you absolutely need to know about a car. And our hope is that that will provide you with the information that you can make a rational decision, a purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rBpAs"&gt;And honestly, very few people come back to us and say the car was not represented correctly. Very, very few. I was really afraid of that, that it would tarnish my reputation. That almost never happens. There’s just so much info in these listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmrQ5A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; As you’re launching it, selling a car in lots of different states, lots of different laws, lots of different regulations. Was that a challenge you had to overcome or you just kind of yoloed it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSZh32"&gt;Yeah, it was a challenge. We consulted a lot of attorneys. The good news is the legal technicalities are not as substantial going across state lines. Even into Canada. It hasn’t been that difficult. The more difficult part is we’ve been asked by a lot of our viewers and our fans, because a lot of my audience is foreign, “Hey, why don’t you expand to Australia, why don’t you expand to Europe?” And that’s just a little bit more difficult. The regulatory stuff there is harder. I’m sure it could be done not that difficultly, but it’s a lot of work on our end to try to think it through. And we’re not sure if it would even work. But no, for the states, we did spend a lot of time trying to figure that stuff out. And there were some states where it’s a little bit more complicated and we had to tweak certain policies or whatever, but we got it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSPsxJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. You’re targeting a younger audience.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;’80s, ’90s, modern, classic cars. There’s a lot of interest in that stuff. What’s the next audience you’re targeting? Are you going to try to go get some boomers and do some ’50s Corvettes? Are you going to be like Gen Z wants 2002 Acuras and that’s what we’re doing next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCqmCj"&gt;People ask us this all the time. What if someone submitted a 1960s Ferrari that was worth a million dollars? You would turn it down? Yes. We are not going to go older. At least right now. We have no plans. It hasn’t even come up. What we see is this trend is just going to continue. Young people are interested in the cars they were interested in when they were young. Some young people have money. Some older people are interested in the cars that young people like as well. And I think that the trend is just going to continue. And the good thing about our business is every year, it expands one more year. That’s the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwGDD4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, you’re not moving the window? The window is just getting bigger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWUPOp"&gt;Only forward. It’ll only move to newer cars. It will not go older than 1981. And people think this is crazy. And it seemed crazy when we launched. It seems a little less crazy now. There’s a sustainable business to be built from doing this. There is a big market in this type of car, and truthfully it was the cars that I was the most interested in. And to be completely candid, it’s more difficult to sell the ’50s and ’60s stuff. Stuff is less verifiable, records are less verifiable. And to be totally honest, the owners of those cars often have a more difficult grasp of the online auction process. And going after younger people has enabled us to be a little bit more streamlined than our competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mINBDv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have to say, you’ve pushed up the prices of Fox body Mustangs and no one should pay that money for Fox body Mustangs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPTzJQ"&gt;All cars. Some of the prices that are... I am blown away and I’ll tell you, I can’t take credit for any of that. Holy crap. The current car market is wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIPz8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got a lower commission rate than some of the competitors. You said you’re profitable. What’s the balance there? Are you having those kinds of business conversations where, “If we want to hire more people, we have to make more money?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApWLF2"&gt;Yeah, of course. And I’m sure all startups have those conversations. “Oh, it would be nice to have someone doing this. Well, revenue needs to increase. Maybe we should do this or that to increase revenue.” But I don’t know, the business has been scaling, it’s been increasing in scale. And so to us, that’s kind of the biggest thing. If we can just get more cars, more users, all the problems take care of themselves basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HUeaR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you’re the top of the funnel for users, right? This is the, “You’ve got a big platform, you’re going to move them to another kind of product.” Are you still the best part of the marketing funnel for Cars and Bids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ertdoE"&gt;Yeah, there’s no question about that, in part, because somehow I became ubiquitous in the online car space and so thus it was easy to direct people to a product like this. And I’ll tell you, proof of the fact that I’m still kind of the driver — there have been other sites that have popped up since we launched. There hadn’t been a lot of others before we launched, but since we launched, many others have popped up and nearly all of them have failed. And I think people see, “Oh, there’s stupid Doug with his stupid T-shirt and shorts starting this website, it must be easy.” It ain’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PogMMr"&gt;And it’s especially difficult to get people to it. It’s difficult enough to set up a website that works in this fashion. That was hard, but to actually bring people there, that’s a whole other thing. And especially when there are established players that you’re competing against. How do you compete against people where sellers know they’ll get top dollar at XYZ website? How do you compete? You have to have a huge audience. And I think you can really only do that if you already have a huge audience, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62HNKq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a formal connection between Doug the YouTube channel and Doug the proprietor of Cars and Bids? What if you get mad at yourself and you stop doing the Cars and Bids tout at the beginning of the videos? How does that actually work? Do you know that you’re going to drive audience? Do you depend on it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2VpUf"&gt;Truthfully, I don’t know the answer to that question. We’re terrified to find out. We’re terrified to stop advertising the videos because what if people don’t come? I don’t know, but hopefully it just continues in this path. I have thought about that, “What if I hate this? I hate these people, I want out. I’m done with this.” I don’t know. But that hasn’t happened and our fingers are crossed that it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIq2yr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if you sell it? If you get burned out of YouTube, and you’re like, “Cars and Bids is my job,” and your marketing funnel goes away, that’s one risk. If you sell Cars and Bids, they’re going to be like, “Well, now we want 50 videos a month to increase the funnel.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUyjV9"&gt;That’s right. And that was something we always thought about. And it’s something we often think about still, if we ever sell it. Yeah, they’re going to want Doug because he’s a part of that. I will say, if you go on the site, you’ll notice there’s not a lot of Doug integrated into it. And that was intentional for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmdXo2"&gt;We wanted to be able to break it away if we could. Either in a sale or honestly, if it ever became bigger and different than Doug, they wanted to go in different directions, we could do that. And so aside from that little thing I write about each listing, it could stand alone. And the goal, I think, is to get it big enough to the point where it does stand alone and you don’t really need Doug. But yeah, I’m terrified. If some buyer’s going to want to come and be like, “Hey, okay, we want the site, but we also want Doug.” And I’m just like, “I don’t want to deal with this crap anymore. Get me out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1UDwn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is kind of related to the overall question for every creator, which is expressed in different ways and different zones that we talked about. But if the business is you, you either don’t have a lot to sell and walk away with. There’s just you. And when you’re done, there isn’t lasting revenue. You’re just like, “I’m done making money now and I hope my Bitcoin investments pay off” or whatever it is that people are doing — I don’t know. I’m not allowed to do any of it. It’s a real disaster over here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSufeU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are one of the rare YouTubers that has set up an entirely independent business that once it’s self-sustaining could just be the business.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do you think your overall exit looks like? Or are you still just in the meat of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="331l1S"&gt;Well, part of the thing about YouTube is a lot of people just lucked into it. They started making videos here and there and it just sort of happened. And so a lot of people aren’t that qualified financially or from an education perspective, they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing. And I’m rare also in the sense that I got an economics degree from a decent college and I intended to work at a desk job my whole life, and the YouTube thing just sort of happened. And so I beg my other YouTube colleagues who do crazy stuff with their money. I say, please, please invest, save, buy property, buy anything you possibly can because this won’t last forever. I’ve been cautious for a few years and I’ll be continuing to be cautious for as many years as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GU3zo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The biggest advice I can give to any YouTuber on the planet or anybody trying to do anything in entertainment is just be really, really cautious.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uu6TDI"&gt;And that’s the biggest advice I can give to any YouTuber on the planet or anybody trying to do anything in entertainment is just be really, really cautious. If people do ever get tired of me and they’re done with me on YouTube, I feel pretty confident that I could survive for a long time before having to get some sort of extra job. I try to live relatively below my means, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mH9oZr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Says the man with the Ford GT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0p0rl"&gt;Hey, the thing is though, that’s an interesting point. It’s so funny. On the channel sometimes I’ll say, “Hey, I can’t afford this new car.” And people are like, “What do you mean? You got a Ford GT.” Well, that Ford GT is up 15 percent in value since I bought it. All these other YouTubers buy new Lamborghinis. Those cars lose $100,000 in value within the first year. And I look at that stuff and I’m like, “This is a terrible decision. How can you do this?” I try to make sure that any big purchases I make at least retain their value to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4NFZk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will say, I bought a Ford Raptor last year and I showed my wife your video, “You should buy a Ford Raptor.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And her response was, will this make you stop talking about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOEWNr"&gt;And did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN3ZW2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it was the best investment. No, definitely not. Now I just talk about how cool it is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNxBY0"&gt;Now you want to modify the Ford Raptor and so that’s where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBGl0N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might’ve already begun. Do you trust YouTube? By the way, Doug is smiling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obNxO2"&gt;That is an interesting question. In some ways, yeah. And in some ways, it’s not that I don’t trust it. It’s just that... I don’t know. I don’t expect they’re doing secretive stuff or they’re trying to screw me or anything. Truthfully, they’ve given us a great life, me and my wife, and so, yeah. But at the same time, you’re always a little bit nervous, I think, is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg42v2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have hedges? Do you have a Twitch channel that you haven’t told anybody about? Have you done Instagram Reels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryqgpz"&gt;No. Cars and Bids is pretty much that. And also a fairly engaged following that I think I could maybe bring elsewhere if I had to, like the site, but I don’t know. I believe in YouTube. I believe in the product. I believe in what they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjKIfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trust is a little harder when you can’t see every facet of [YouTube]. But I trust it as much as I can.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rdj4Vt"&gt;The greatest thing that YouTube ever gave us was the democratization of stuff. You can get how-to videos without having to check out a book at the library or buy a book or buy information. You can get car reviews. I can do car reviews without having to work my way up at a magazine where I’d still be making coffee for people at this age. It’s so cool to be able to have that. I know YouTube has flaws and they would probably recognize it as well, but from a pure perspective of what it’s done for the world and what it’s done for me personally, I love YouTube. I truly, truly love YouTube. Trust is a little harder when you can’t see every facet of it. But I trust it as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHkX2I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, the reason I ask is, we had &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the chief product officer of YouTube on the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a couple of weeks ago. I did my best to ask him all the hardest questions I could. And, to be perfectly candid, it felt like I was hitting a bunch of brick walls. And that is what it is. His job was to come and promote a thing, and he did a good job at that. But I asked him; people’s money, their livelihoods, depend on you. Don’t you need to be more transparent? And he was kind of like, I think we are. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYqEbu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that tension, to me, is something that — as every platform tries to become a creator haven and do NFTs, and Facebook is going to pay creators a billion dollars over the next five years or whatever they’re promising to do — the pull away from YouTube might actually be more transparency versus more money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoFaiF"&gt;Yeah. That’s an interesting point. YouTube has kind of drawn this line in the sand. This is how transparent they want to be. And yeah, maybe people will want more transparency, but it’s just so hard because disruptors come. Right now, there doesn’t look like a truly viable YouTube disruptor, but I wouldn’t have said that about a lot of stuff three years ago and you never really know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8NLR2"&gt;Creators are generally a little disappointed with the platform. I’m on YouTuber Facebook pages and closed car YouTuber groups and you get complaints, and I get it. Some days, some months, your ad rates are way down and you’re like, it doesn’t make any sense. But you just have to take the bad with the good... I just look at the opportunity that I was given and this amazing life and I realize, even if it did turn off tomorrow, it was a pretty cool few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGtZ5Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some other creators I talk to, especially the more lifestyle creators, they’re trying to leverage themselves into TV shows or Netflix deals or Hulu deals or whatever. I’m assuming a lot of people have approached you to make Doug for Peacock or one of the streaming services. Does that interest you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mHoA0"&gt;Yeah, I’ve been approached. But the deals are just never that good. That’s the problem. The flexibility that I have is wild. It’s just the next level of insane. I can shoot a video in a day, whereas I shot a commercial with Audi a couple months ago, and shooting a couple scenes in a four-minute commercial took a whole day. Shooting maybe 30 seconds of footage that they use took a day. I can shoot a 34-minute video in a morning and be home. And going up to LA and having to do all that stuff with TV, or even if it came here, doing all the canned stuff, it’s never great. If someone came to me and was like, you could do this cool thing for Netflix or whatever and it really jived with my life, I would do it, but I don’t know. Right now it’s just hard to look past the benefit you get from the pure schedule flexibility on YouTube. My wife is having a baby here in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1ZLjb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNUVn9"&gt;Thank you. And I’m able to shoot 12, 18 weeks of content beforehand. And then I can take a paternity leave. That’s not always that easy on other platforms. I don’t know. It’s just harder. YouTube is a good way to live if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrDZKm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think you’ve lucked into particularly a format and a category that allows for that.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I talked to other YouTubers. The idea of a parental leave is just terrifying to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrvDBd"&gt;That’s the thing that if it was up to me, beyond the transparency, beyond the income, beyond the ad rates, that’s the thing that YouTube should be getting taken to task more for — the inability to take a break. The algorithm probably punishes you if you do. And that’s not really great for people’s health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qNA9mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Beyond the transparency, beyond the income, beyond the ad rates, that’s the thing that YouTube should be getting taken to task more for — the inability to take a break.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ai03yq"&gt;Now the problem is no one wants to advocate for YouTubers. They’re living these great lives and making a lot of money and they have the cameras. They’re kind of annoying. And so nobody’s there helping the creators. But I really think that’s the one thing that I wish YouTube would do. Give two weeks off a year and just average of your last two weeks of views or whatever. And you don’t get penalized or anything for now. That would be nice. But I think you start to get into some employment law situations that they don’t want to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2cdU9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. You’ve given us way more time than I anticipated. Thank you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU3MeV"&gt;No, I’m happy to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKMycg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for Doug the channel? What’s next for Cars and Bids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K26kXU"&gt;And by the way, I’m happy to answer these questions, in part because I never get to talk about the business. Every podcast, everybody wants to talk about cars, which is great, but it’s so interesting to discuss this sort of thing. To me, at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNIRHc"&gt;What’s next for Doug the channel? I don’t know. I guess more car reviews, more new cars. I do a big December every year. So I’ve started thinking about that. It’s tough. It’s a lot of pressure, but the ad rates are always higher in December. So I try to take advantage of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02I2Le"&gt;The next thing for Cars and Bids is more growth and more new features. Those are the things that we’re looking at. More new, cool stuff that we can do to differentiate more and to make it an even better experience. So there’s always a lot of stuff happening. It’s a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikdJ8t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, that’s great, man. I love talking to you. I could keep talking to you for hours, but I know you got to go. Thank you so much for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wm9r1G"&gt;Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its Partner Program now has 2 million members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5HvgfuCsMLkbcs_IeRH5uM-oek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763043/acastro_200123_3880_Youtube_NDA_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program has passed the 2 million creator mark | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGOdvM"&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program, which allows users to make money off their videos, has passed the 2 million creator mark, the company said Monday. The platform has helped turn YouTube into a viable business for top creators like PewDiePie and Jenna Marbles, but it’s also been the cause of consternation for the company when eligible partners — often those same top creators — do something that reflects poorly on the platform and temporarily drives away advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqHByb"&gt;Creators who qualify for the Partner Program — you need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of overall watch time on your channel in the past 12 months — can earn money through ads, subscription fees, donations, livestreaming, and YouTube Premium revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daTupU"&gt;The Google-owned company has struggled at times to find the balance between having a lot of creators who rake in ad revenue and keeping advertisers happy. This has included deciding when to remove ads from channels that engage in harassment or other problematic content; while YouTube takes a cut of eligible creators’ ad revenue, if advertisers are wary of a channel’s content, they’ll pull their ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VExuM"&gt;YouTube updated its harassment policy in 2019 in response to some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754620/youtube-commentary-harassment-creators-bullying-susan-wojcicki"&gt;creator-on-creator harassment&lt;/a&gt;, which was a significant corner of the site for years, and has punished creators who cross legal or ethical lines by demonetizing their channels. In the past year, that’s included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164553/youtube-coronavirus-demonetization-sensitive-subjects-advertising-guidelines-revenue"&gt;demonetizing videos&lt;/a&gt; that mention the coronavirus, considered a sensitive topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0h5NP"&gt;Neal Mohan, chief product officer at YouTube, said in a blog post that the number of new channels joining the program in 2020 more than doubled when compared to 2019, and the number of YouTube channels making six figures or more in revenue is up 35 percent year over year (but he didn’t provide the specific number of creators who make that much money). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLHBx5"&gt;“Finding new ways to reward trusted creators financially and help them ramp up their businesses will always be a top priority for us,” Mohan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knY9Jo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will show video chapters right in search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F62xFfzmePlBnSwjOGov7rho4FY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736466/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBGCdo"&gt;YouTube is announcing some new features for search to make it easier to find what you’re looking for amid the huge amount of content on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5gBA"&gt;One helpful update is that YouTube will show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272095/youtube-chapters-feature-video-google-android-ios-desktop-mobile"&gt;video chapters&lt;/a&gt; right in search results, which should make it easier to jump to the exact part of a video that might be most helpful to you. Instead of having to tap into a video and scroll through the chapters just to find exactly the information that you’re looking for, you’ll be able to see the chapters from a search so you can navigate to certain spots in a video more easily. YouTube is also adding video previews to search results on mobile, meaning you can see a short clip of a video before you tap into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="48x0Ob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video previews are coming to mobile search results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14OB8H"&gt;Another change is designed to help people find videos if there isn’t any content about what they’re looking for in their local language. If that’s the case, YouTube will show videos with automatically translated captions, titles, and descriptions in search results. The videos that will show up, in this case, are in English to start, but the company plans to expand this to more languages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPUzIP"&gt;And to further help people find information on YouTube, the company is experimenting with adding website links and “other formats” from Google Search to YouTube search results. This experiment is only available on mobile in India and Indonesia, but the company says it will “consider expanding” the feature to additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jake Paul will not face federal charges after FBI raid</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nhD7h"&gt;The US Attorney won’t be filing any charges against Jake Paul, according &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/12/jake-paul-no-federal-charges-arizona-mall-incident-george-floyd-protest-scottsdale-looting/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;TMZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Paul’s lawyers. Paul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;raided his house&lt;/a&gt;, for his involvement in an incident that took place at an Arizona mall in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tuxpr"&gt;These particular legal troubles began when Paul was filmed in and around a mall in Scottsdale, AZ, which was being looted in the wake of police brutality protests sparked by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529934/darnella-frazier-filmed-george-floyd-murder-phone-pulitzer-prize-citation"&gt;the murder of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. Paul denied participating in the looting (and wasn’t seen doing so in the videos that circulated on social media), but was still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280476/jake-paul-arizona-protests-riots-youtube-filming-scottsdale"&gt;charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly&lt;/a&gt; by the Scottsdale Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDScL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;According to police&lt;/a&gt;, the charges against Paul were then dropped to allow the FBI to carry out a federal criminal investigation. In a now-deleted video, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;Paul said that investigation was why the FBI raided his home&lt;/a&gt; in California, in August 2020. At the time, the FBI confirmed that it did carry out “federal search warrants” in California related to the investigation, but would not comment on what they were looking for or what was found. Now, it seems, that investigation is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLBpFO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;same &lt;a href="https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C"&gt;https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/1424189582036373510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvxOmq"&gt;So far, Jake Paul himself seemingly hasn’t commented on the US Attorney’s decision. Last week, though, he made a reference on Twitter to running away from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAUZ7J"&gt;Paul’s counsel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they “are pleased that the United States Attorney reached the conclusion that no criminal charges should be filed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIuQKo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google restricts ad targeting of minors and will delist photos of kids at their request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/deMVcuNuh3-WUHd8pQ0Eze12oas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703530/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjSm2A"&gt;Google will no longer allow ad targeting of children based on their age, gender, or interests as part of a new series of measures designed to protect kids under 18 using its services, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/families/giving-kids-and-teens-safer-experience-online/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Other changes include a new option for anyone under the age of 18 to ask for their images to be removed from Google’s image results, while YouTube uploads from children will also gradually default to the most private setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFl8WW"&gt;The changes are similar to what Facebook introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595897/instagram-under-16-accounts-private-default-limited-advertising"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; when it said Instagram accounts for kids under 16 will be set to private by default, meaning users have to choose to make their profiles public. It also banned ads targeted at children based on their interests or their activity, although it still allowed them to be targeted based on age, gender, and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7FhFUZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube uploads will also be more private by default&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdvwgq"&gt;Google says it’s introducing its changes based on new regulations being introduced in some countries, and that it wants to offer “consistent product experiences and user controls” globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiK2mA"&gt;Requesting an image’s removal from Google’s image search won’t remove it from the web entirely, Google cautions, but it says this should give users more control over the spread of their images. Alongside its changes to ad targeting, Google also says it’s expanding safeguards to stop “age-sensitive ad categories” from being shown to teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiEgb9"&gt;The search giant is also making a number of other tweaks to its services for children. SafeSearch will now be on by default for users under the age of 18, after previously being on by default for users under 13. The feature, which blocks explicit results from appearing in search, is also coming to Google’s web browser on smart displays. Users under the age of 18 will also no longer be able to turn Location History on in their Google Account settings (Google says the setting is already off by default for all accounts). Assistant-enabled smart devices will also be able to block news, podcasts, and access to the web in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ocJFL"&gt;On YouTube, autoplay will be off by default for kids under 18, and it’s turning on break reminders. YouTube Kids is getting a new autoplay option, but it’ll also be off by default. And there will be new resources available “for young people and their parents to help them better understand [Google’s] data practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh6WrV"&gt;The new features are being introduced on different time scales. The option to request that images be removed from Google’s image search, as well as changes to default YouTube video privacy settings, will rollout in the coming weeks. The new restrictions on ad targeting, SafeSearch changes, and tools to block content on Google Assistant-enabled smart devices are launching in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube creators can now get $10,000 per month for making Shorts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWPkpGiuvRt7v7-hl7L8GpheuuE=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672262/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dheGLX"&gt;YouTube will pay creators up to $10,000 per month for making popular videos on its TikTok competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;plans to pay $100 million&lt;/a&gt; throughout the next year, with the first payments going out this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TrX7e"&gt;The fund could mean a whole lot of cash for creators, but payouts aren’t guaranteed. The popularity needed to earn money will depend on just how many people are making and watching Shorts each month, and payouts will also depend on where each creator’s audience is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWfP9W"&gt;YouTube is also requiring these to be original videos. Reuploads and videos tagged with watermarks from other platforms — aka TikTok, Snapchat, or Reels — will disqualify a channel for payments. The payments are only available in 10 regions for now, including the US, UK, India, and Brazil, among others, and YouTube says it plans on expanding that list “in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zmVYn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The model has to work differently.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sum57e"&gt;Creators have traditionally gotten paid on YouTube based on the ads that run in front of their videos, with there being a direct relationship between the number of ad views and the amount of money they receive. But with Shorts, YouTube doesn’t want to run an ad in front of every quick clip, so it’s building out this alternate form of payment to reward creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDfOHF"&gt;The Shorts Fund will eventually be replaced with a “long-term, scalable monetization program,” Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief product officer, said on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22370337"&gt;today’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fund is “a way to get going and to actually really start to figure out” how monetization should work for creators making these videos. “You’re essentially consuming a feed of shorts, and so the model has to work differently,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHUfFw"&gt;Payment schemes like this have become increasingly common. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; both pay out to creators based on the popularity of their videos, rather than based on ads. The result is potentially lucrative for creators, though there’s less transparency on how much creators may earn any given month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMC3Vm"&gt;For YouTube, the fund offers a way to kickstart its late-in-the-game effort at a short-form video service. Though TikTok has a huge head start, YouTube is, at the end of the day, YouTube — an enormous and hugely popular video platform — which could give it an edge as it tries to spin up Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRohP3"&gt;Mohan indicated that YouTube wouldn’t require creators to use Shorts in order to boost their overall engagement on the platform. “Our goal there is to give every creator a voice,” Mohan said on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;. “If the creator wants to do that through a two-hour documentary about a particular topic they’re passionate about, then YouTube should be the place for that. If they want to do that through a 15-second Short, that mixes in their favorite hit from their favorite music artists, they should be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube chief product officer Neal Mohan on the algorithm, monetization, and the future for creators</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A peek behind the curtain at the creator economy and what’s next for YouTube Shorts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1LzaEM"&gt;YouTube chief product officer Neal Mohan joined &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; this week to discuss YouTube’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22370332"&gt;$100 million fund to begin paying creators who use YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;, which is its competitor to TikTok. Mohan is bullish on Shorts, which he connects to YouTube’s earliest days as a way to quickly share personal videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p29UYs"&gt;But YouTube is now much more than that; it remains the default video hosting platform for the entire internet, in a way that can feel almost invisible. It operates a linear TV service that competes with cable providers and a music streaming service. And, of course, there are YouTubers, the influencers at the center of the creator economy — the people who have turned YouTube into not only careers, but multimillion dollar businesses that extend into everything from merch drops to cheeseburger restaurants. When people talk about creators and the creator economy, they’re often just talking about YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBMjTZ"&gt;Two notes: first, I encourage you to listen to this episode if you can. We love providing these transcripts, but for this episode I think there’s a lot that gets lost in the back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3yvTr"&gt;Second, at the end of this interview I asked Neal to let me watch YouTube videos at 1.5 speed on my TV. He said he’d heard the request before and he’d look into it. Turns out, that feature was shipped a month ago, and neither of us knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCxtuU"&gt;Because YouTube is so big. And so is this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K6oOxg"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7415686245" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XCzIRw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cPro8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a new monetization system for YouTube Shorts. It seems very interesting — it’s a big program, and you’re a full participant in the creator economy. But I want to start at the beginning with some very simple questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANo9Ej"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the chief product officer at YouTube do all day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6LlMQ"&gt;My responsibility is really to help run YouTube. I’m responsible for all of our products, everything that you use as a viewer of YouTube, everything our creators use. I work very closely with our partners across Google in terms of solutions for our advertising partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXNnET"&gt;So: all of our products, from the main app to the Kids app to the Music app. And I’m also responsible for our trust and safety organization, so everything that has to do with our content policies, what governs the type of content that we allow on our platform, the content that we take down. We call them our community guidelines, and so my teams are responsible for that, as well as the design of our products, how they look and feel, how they work, [the] critical user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KF2jp"&gt;That’s really what my team and I do all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzr8q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s unique, I think, among all the social platforms that the trust and safety team reports to the product team. I do want to dive into that, but just give me a sense of your day: what kind of meetings are you in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2TchO"&gt;I’m in a lot of meetings. Everything from one-on-ones to very large meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2UomS"&gt;But maybe I could give you a flavor of a couple of canonical meetings which, in my view, are the critical decision-making meetings at YouTube as they relate to product. A lot of the types of meetings that I’m in are what we call “product reviews.” They are meetings that could be about any of our products or features across all of YouTube, oftentimes involving multiple surfaces, multiple teams. There are venues where we are able to get a status of how a particular product is doing in terms of its roadmap, development, readiness to launch, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrFKqo"&gt;But they are, critically, decision-making meetings. By the time those types of decisions come to me, they’ve of course gone through multiple levels within my organization, and haven’t been able to get resolved for one reason or the other. Oftentimes, my job is to help tie-break across them, and make what is essentially a trade-off between whether we should do a feature this way, or whether we should do it that way. That’s typically a 30- to 45-minute discussion, and we have lots of those throughout the course of a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwIf1S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me an example. What’s a tie you recently broke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HkLNA"&gt;The interesting thing about YouTube — which will sound obvious but is actually something that’s pretty fundamental to all of our product decisions and in fact many of our policy decisions — is that it’s an app, but it’s really an ecosystem. That term gets used a lot, but in the YouTube context, it means a balance between viewers, creators, advertisers, and partners that are all participants in our ecosystem. Oftentimes, we are making decisions in our products that have a pretty big impact on all of those or some of those constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJtzNo"&gt;And so, an example of some of those types of decisions; if we design a feature this way, is it going to be something that is easy for our creators to use and understand? Is it something that we need to put front and center? Is it going to be cluttered that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn6T9q"&gt;For example, if you’re a creator, one of the tools that you use a lot is called YouTube Studio. It’s the place where you go to upload your videos and where you understand the stats around your videos. An example of a trade-off there is: if we have a new metric that we’re bringing to creators to measure the efficacy of how their videos are doing — are they getting the audience they’re looking for? — we can put that front and center, or we can put that in a flow that might be behind a couple of clicks in a way where it might not be as prominent, but it’s alongside other reports and metrics that make sense to the user. That’s an example of a relatively straightforward type of trade-off, but my teams are making hundreds of those types of decisions on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1dTmE"&gt;I think, just pulling it back up from that very specific example, what I try to do in terms of all of these meetings is really to establish principles. What is the framework or the set of principles by which we would make those types of decisions? And one of those north stars is how effective, how useful it is for our creators, based on their input, but also just based on the data that we see in terms of how they use it, are they getting value out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeLax4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I always ask this question: what’s your decision-making framework? You lead right into it; you’ve got some principles. What are the two or three core principles that come up in every decision for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZM5fO"&gt;I think actually there’s three critical things that every company or organization needs to think about when it comes to decisions. The first are our principles. And so, I mentioned putting our creators first, putting our viewers first, just like a uber-north-star-type principle. Another principle that comes up in the context of YouTube is: YouTube is an open platform, but it also has community guidelines. How do you balance those seemingly two competing principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FR5EMt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="elEEDO"&gt;That’s an example of principles that go into decision-making, but I don’t think it’s just about principles in terms of good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2hS9M"&gt;I think that there’s a couple other things that are just as important. The second is obvious: the people that make decisions. There are thousands of decisions being made across the YouTube organization every single day on behalf of our viewers and our creators. Of course, I’m not making all of them. What’s important there, for me, is to make sure that I have the right people throughout my organization to be able to make those decisions, because I can’t be there all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFfwaI"&gt;And the third thing, which I think often gets overlooked, [are] the processes by which you actually make those decisions. And so, you and I just talked about one of those processes in the context of meetings — product reviews. How are they set up, what’s the cadence, what’s the criteria by which decisions should come to those types of meetings? How do you measure the impact of those decisions? We have a process at YouTube called our OKR [objectives and key results] process. That’s a quarterly, yearly process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qf8c9"&gt;And so, I think those three things, principles, people, and then the processes by which you manage all of it, go into any effective decision-making framework. That’s how I think about things as it relates to my organization at YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wE1Qu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned people. You have a huge remit. How many direct reports do you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dVo8P"&gt;I’d say I have about eight or nine direct reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkCj2j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is that structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjTfn0"&gt;I have various leaders for the various product areas, many of which you would be able to guess from the outside. We have teams of people, including a leader, focused on tools for our creators. We have leaders that are focused on trust and safety, both on the product side and on the operation side. I have a leader that’s focused on overall design and the UX and user research framework. Leaders focused on our core experiences, Music, Premium, YouTube TV...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJG9CS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re way over nine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ivln"&gt;Some of these are lumped together. For example, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are under one product leader on my team. We have a leader who’s focused on what we call our vertical experiences, community experiences. I know you alluded to this at the top around YouTube Shorts. That’s a new product. I have a leader that’s focused on those types of community experiences. So it’s roughly about eight or nine leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osfcpD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about Shorts. Shorts is a new product &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that launched in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s now in the US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and now it is at the top level of the YouTube app on the home screen. It’s one click away, and there’s a new monetization system for it. That’s a pretty fast waterfall of emphasis, right? It was in one market as a test, now it’s on the top level of the app, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now there’s a monetization fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Walk me through that process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8ABeP"&gt;The way I would give you some insight into how all of this came about is actually going back 15 years to the very first video that was uploaded to YouTube, which is kind of a canonical, famous video now: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw"&gt;“Me at the Zoo.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av4DrU"&gt;That was an 18-second video that was uploaded in the San Diego Zoo, and it was the genesis of YouTube. Back then, “user-generated content” was a new term. 15 years later, the world has evolved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZaotP"&gt;One of the biggest differences has been the mobile phone and creation on mobile devices; you have this incredible camera and all of these incredibly effective editing tools right there on your phone. If you take that 18-second video that happened 15 years ago and fast-forward it to today, if something like that was being created today, how would it be done? Well, it’d be done on a mobile device. All the editing horsepower would be right there on the device. You might be shooting it vertically instead of horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yvdIMJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorts tries to address how video is made now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAv3pJ"&gt;So my team and I put ourselves in the shoes of today’s creators. [That’s] really where Shorts came from. Unlike 15 years ago, if you were a creator just getting started on YouTube today, how would you go about doing that? And that was the key product insight or genesis, if you will, of YouTube Shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlYIZx"&gt;You asked a couple of other questions in there in terms of how it got from that idea to where it is today. I’d say a few things; first of all, as you know, YouTube is a global platform. Some of our largest and fastest-growing markets are outside of the US and North America. You mentioned one of them, India. Increasingly, we have to think about things in terms of really trying to launch globally as quickly as possible. That’s always been a mantra at Google and YouTube, but we really want to live up to that with all of our products. And Shorts was an example of that, where, as you pointed out, we did launch in India first, then we came to the US, and now, of course, it’s global as of the last couple of weeks. That was a little bit of the insight in terms of why we decided to go about that route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G55g9Z"&gt;We’ve seen growth globally, across all of our markets, as we’ve rolled out this product. I think on the earnings call a couple of days ago, Sundar [Pichai] mentioned 15 billion views globally across Shorts, and that number continues to grow. So that’s how we got to where we are in terms of the core product. It is critically important, from a viewer standpoint and a creator standpoint, to the overall YouTube experience. I’ve talked about that and Susan [Wojcicki], our CEO, has talked about that in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LjvxY"&gt;That’s why you see its prominence in the app. That’s why you see it as a tab. I would argue that there are other surfaces that, from a user standpoint, are even more important. You see it right below a video that you watch, right? You can tap that “create” icon right below a video. And that’s actually what gives that some of its YouTubey flavor, because it ties this new format, Shorts, to existing videos in our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rvj9a"&gt;Then the third part of your question, which is monetization. I think this also ties back to where YouTube came from, the genesis of YouTube. There’s a lot of conversation today about the new creator economy. That’s almost become a buzzword. I think sometimes people lose sight of the fact that YouTube has been in the creator economy business for over a decade. [It’s been] 14 years since we launched the YouTube Partner Program. In the last three years, we’ve paid out over $30 billion to our creators, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22370332"&gt;the Shorts fund, this $100 million fund&lt;/a&gt;, is really just another step in that journey, and is really the first step in terms of figuring out what the long-term monetization program could look like for Shorts creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoiQFS"&gt;Sorry for the long answer, but I thought I’d give you the full color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1Smg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m here for it. I have follow-up questions for everything you said. Let’s start at the start. Your connection to the early days of YouTube and how you’d make “My Day at the Zoo” now, I buy it. I have a more cynical version of the story though, and I want you to clarify it for me. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LM9yq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more cynical version is: Snapchat launched Stories, and then &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram launched Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and then &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14653558/whatsapp-stories-status-tab-snapchat-clone"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp launched Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and then YouTube launched Stories, and then &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn launched Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and now there’s Stories everywhere. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAVvte"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then TikTok came out, and TikTok is a cultural phenomenon. And now there’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;something that looks exactly like TikTok in Instagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and there is Shorts, which looks exactly like TikTok in YouTube. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwgsEa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That feels like maybe an unfairly cynical reading, but it’s also definitely the correct timeline. Do you think of Shorts as a direct competitor to TikTok?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wa4fD"&gt;I’ll put it in context from my perspective. Thinking about things from a creator standpoint — you’re a video creator or you’re a creator that’s looking to build an audience — personally, I believe that it’s really great that there’s lots of platforms, lots of choices, lots of different ways that you can build an audience. I would argue that all of these platforms, while they might seem similar in many ways, are fundamentally very, very different, but I actually think that’s great for creators because it gives them a diversity of options. That’s what I would say first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRkauT"&gt;I would just say that we look at the Shorts product through the lens of “simple, fast, easy, but powerful mobile creation.” Ten years ago, you would have a camera, you’d have a tripod, you’d set it up in your family room or in your backyard or in your bedroom, and you would start vlogging. I really think the world is very different [now]. And, as you know, many parts of the world are leapfrogging that generation completely with the prevalence of mobile phones and the power on those devices. I really do look at what we’re doing with Shorts through that lens, and I think the roadmap that we have will also prove out that we’re thinking about those pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zhr3mX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorts can pull audio from YouTube videos or link out to them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gfyVq9"&gt;When you think about it through a mobile creation lens, there’s lots of pieces that might, at the highest level, seem similar. But then, when you scratch the surface, I think hopefully our users and our creators will start to see many of the things that make YouTube Shorts unique to YouTube. I’ll give you a couple of examples of those. And by the way, the Shorts product — I love it, obviously, I watch lots of Shorts every day — but it is by no means feature-complete. There’s a lot more work that we have to do, and I’ll be the first to say that upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHuWQw"&gt;But there are a couple of features that I’ll call out that you can see already, that I think are leaning into that unique YouTube aspect. The first is the ability to take any audio sample from an existing video on YouTube and mix that into a Short. That is the glue between this new product, Shorts, and our existing, vast corpus of videos. That audio of course can be music, [but] it can [also] be audio from another iconic, canonical video that exists on YouTube. So that’s a unique-to-YouTube feature in terms of going from videos to Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9ZDDp"&gt;And then, one of the other things that I think is cool is it can go in the other direction too, which is Shorts are oftentimes about music, right? We just did this big rollout with BTS and “Permission to Dance,” you might’ve seen over the last few days. Well, it should be really easy from that Short to be able to click on the song that’s sampled there, to get to the music video that exists on YouTube, where that video is getting hundreds of millions, oftentimes over a billion views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGQLjd"&gt;The conductivity between those two things can go in either direction, and I think that is something you can expect to see more and more of. That’s what I would say in terms of context: mobile creation first, and then what are the unique-to-YouTube features we can continue to build for something like Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vNCC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think one of the underappreciated aspects of TikTok is that it is a very powerful video editor. That’s the thing it presents to the user; they roll out a bunch of AI filters. Those filters take on a life of their own, they’re easy to use and repurpose. You see [their names] on the top level of the videos. Are you heavily invested in that as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1J3kx"&gt;That’s an area where you can expect to continue to see us invest [and] where I also think we’re going to take our cues from our creators. One of the analogies that I like to use with my product team is our job vis-à-vis creators is to “set the stage.” Our job is to actually create the world’s best stage from an innovation standpoint, but it’s our creators who basically perform on that stage, and that’s where the magic comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tmNBv"&gt;One of the things that we’re already starting to see, in terms of feedback from our creators, is they really like the product, but they would like to see XYZ. Some of that might be around effects. Some of that might be around things like filters, editing, all those types of capabilities that you described. Like I said, I think that we have the makings of a really fun and powerful product there, but we’re by no means done. So the answer in short is yes, we should be doing a lot more there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hF87P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me play with that metaphor for a minute. You say stage and players on the stage, but a much more boring way of breaking that up is that YouTube is a great distribution platform. Ninety-nine percent of the people who make YouTube videos make their videos in Adobe Premiere Pro, or Final Cut, or LumaFusion, or whatever, and they use YouTube for distribution and monetization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9jOHM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok has a distribution component, but it also has a powerful creation engine inside it. YouTube has historically not spent a lot of time on creation tools. Now you’re saying you’ve got to build up that creation skillset. Do you have that in-house? Are you ready to go? Is there a product roadmap there? Are you waiting to figure it out? What does that look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmJ6o3"&gt;The first thing I would say is that it is true that the predominant use case — at least when it comes to videos that have wide distribution, lots of views on YouTube — are videos that were shot [and] edited elsewhere, and then uploaded to YouTube. And YouTube Studio is about managing those videos on YouTube as opposed to having a suite of editing tools. So that’s correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meAhwS"&gt;But I think I’ll go back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the genesis of Shorts and things like that. And if you zoom back out from just the Shorts product and the Shorts roadmap as it is, and if you think about one of the core product insights — I’ll keep coming back to it — which is creation through mobile phones and the power that these phones bring to that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YbDAk"&gt;And it’s not just power in terms of tools, in terms of what you described. It’s actually also the flip side of power: ease of use. Because you can do things so powerfully on the phones, oftentimes on the client itself, you are enabling a whole suite of tools that can be really easy for creators to use. Yes, that’s an area that we want to continue to invest in. It’s also an area where, as we grow, our creators that are producing predominantly on their mobile phones, we get feedback where, it’s awesome that you’re doing this, but here’s the next set of things that you could be doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuSues"&gt;So I really do look at it through the lens of, if a creator is getting started today, what are their expectations? How are they going to build their audience on YouTube? And part of that is enabling a set of tools on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Al9hO3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok is a merging of distribution and creation. Instagram, I think historically, is the first app that really merged a creative tool with distribution. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEdgqG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube is a big app. There’s a lot going on in the YouTube app. You’re adding more to it. Are you going to add the creation tools to the YouTube app or are they going to be in a different app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYtz82"&gt;I don’t think I can say specifically today. What I will say though is, bringing it back to Shorts, a lot of the ways that you can enhance the video that you shot for your Shorts should live in that overall Shorts workflow. Now, does that mean that there shouldn’t be another set of capabilities for videos outside of Shorts? I can’t comment on that specifically today, but our goal is to continue to make the Shorts experience more feature-rich for video creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl8p0U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see a lot of repurposed TikTok videos on Shorts. I see a lot of repurposed TikTok videos on Reels. I know repurposed TikTok videos on Instagram Reels bothers Instagram. Does it bother you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95pmzG"&gt;I would tie this back to where we started the conversation. One of our core north star principles in terms of product design at YouTube is doing what really works for our users and our viewers. That is the lens through which we look at it. Obviously we have lots of signals and lots of data that we get from our users there. And our goal is to make Shorts content of whatever form easily and readily available to our users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOqIyo"&gt;That’s why you see the Shorts shelf right on the home feed. It’s also why you see the tab that’s there, the permanence of that Shorts tab. So that’s how we look at it from a user standpoint. From a creative standpoint, I think what I’ll tell you is that those trends are changing on a regular basis. The amount of, first of all, new creators, but also creators that are coming back and producing original Shorts on our platform, that number is going up and to the right on a week-on-week basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zO1fos"&gt;And so that is another set of metrics that we look at, not just the viewer metrics, but also how easy, fun, powerful the toolset is for our creators. We’ve begun the journey there. We launched globally just a couple of weeks ago. So there’s still a lot more to be done, especially on the creator side, to make it so that it’s easier and more powerful and even more fun for them to produce original content for YouTube. But even with where our tools are today, that number continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqpfEb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I say, “Instagram is not happy about it,” what I mean specifically is they openly announced &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that videos with watermarks in them would get lower engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; than videos without watermarks. Which is a very roundabout way of saying, “Hey, when you export a video from TikTok, it has a watermark. And if you repurpose it to Instagram, we’re going to lower its engagement.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlJ3my"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you thought about similar moves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="up8uoj"&gt;The high-level answer I’ll give you there is that first of all, we make decisions and tweaks and updates to our recommendation and ranking algorithms all the time, multiple times a month, just to make it work better and better for our users. But we have a set of core north star principles and metrics by which we govern that. And they are driven by things like viewer satisfaction, engagement from our viewers, the feedback that we get directly from our viewers in those little surveys that you see in the app on a regular basis. That is the lens through which we will make decisions on things like ranking of Shorts, just like we do for quote unquote traditional videos on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxufGw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other thing is, with Instagram particularly, they’re very explicit with their creators that using their additional products boosts their overall engagement. So when they had Stories, using Stories boosted your engagement. Now they have Reels; using Reels boosts your engagement. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Et5K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a similar set of products. You have a similar, if not nearly overlapping base of creators on your platform who are used to that dynamic. Are you saying to them, “Use Shorts to boost your overall engagement, and if you don’t, your engagement will go down”? Because I hear that dynamic from creators all the time, that they feel like they have to expand into every surface of the app to keep that core engagement high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlvM9K"&gt;We don’t talk about that in the explicit way that you’re describing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6erAJU"&gt;I like to keep tying these back to what the core principles are — and I gave you examples of that on the user side. On the creator side, our goal is to give every creator a voice. If the creator wants to do that through a two-hour documentary about a particular topic they’re passionate about, then YouTube should be the place for that. If they want to do that through a 15-second Short that mixes in their favorite hit from their favorite music artist, they should be able to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqBeYN"&gt;That’s why I work at YouTube; the diversity of creators that we support. I think it’s the core mission of YouTube. When we have conversations with creators, it’s about — what are the sets of products and features and policies that we should put in place that allows them to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="kz4VKw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have lots of creators that are never going to try Shorts, and that’s fine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQijUf"&gt;We have lots of creators that are never going to try Shorts, and that’s fine. We have lots of creators who have been video creators and vloggers on our platform for 10 years and are super, super excited about Shorts. And that’s awesome too. The way I look at it is [that] all of these products can be successful, and creators know what really works for them and their audiences. Our job is to address all of those lanes for our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcMEvd"&gt;We’re talking here about Shorts, which I’m incredibly excited about. It’s great to see the growth of it. But we’ve also had other products and other modes that have existed on YouTube for a long time, and not all creators take advantage of all of them. For example, we’ve had live products on YouTube for many, many years. Not all creators are comfortable or want to do live content, but lots and lots of creators do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moJFkH"&gt;I have a team that’s focused on live products for creators. They want to make those best in class for creators all over the world. It’s probably going to be a fraction of overall creators on YouTube that use those live products, but when they do, we want them to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrIcL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think it’s important to be explicit though, because a lot of the creators we’re talking about, the professionals — this is their living, their livelihoods. The pressure to win the algorithm to make more money, or to make more stuff to feed the algorithm, is very high, and the opacity of the algorithm drives people crazy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ7bxd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I always joke that the life cycle of every YouTuber hits a point where they all make a video about how they’re mad at YouTube. It’s the end of one road and then that road branches off. And I think the heart of that is the opacity of how the product works. How do you balance needing to change, to be flexible, with needing to be explicit and transparent about how your product affects people’s money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw2xvI"&gt;Yeah, I think it’s a really, really interesting question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Hm8G"&gt;I would say a few things, and there’s a lot to your question because you talked about money, there’s a distribution component obviously to that as well. I think that our job is to be as clear as we possibly can about what works on YouTube [and] what doesn’t work on YouTube. We have entire teams — business-facing teams, creator-facing teams — that are focused on helping everything from creators getting started on our platform, to how do they grow their audience, [to] how do they think about monetization — not just ads, but a lot of the new monetization products that we have developed. So we do have teams that are working with our creators. We have ways of doing that, not just for our top creators, but we also have ways of doing that in a scaled fashion for our up-and-coming creators as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URCn0T"&gt;Those are programs that we’ve invested in. Could we do more there? Yeah, of course we could continue to do a lot more there. Every year I feel like we get a little bit better in terms of explaining all of this and laying this out for our creators so that they can make informed choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBtFJb"&gt;I also recognize that there’s lots of things that creators have to think about: distribution, monetization, our community guidelines, etc. So I do think it is my team’s responsibility, YouTube’s responsibility overall. Susan, our CEO, has talked about this too, of making it easier for our creators to navigate all of this. And so that’s a journey that we’re on. We need to continue to get better and better at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM5XfJ"&gt;But I will also say that we have creators that have been on the platform for three, five, 10 years who continue to build a living, [who] continue to build an audience. They are some of the most inspiring, amazing people in the world. They are attuned to their audience. They adjust with their audience, they get feedback from their audience on a regular basis and they continue to produce incredible, awesome content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPQvO3"&gt;One of the other areas though — how do we give creators the tools that they need to be able to take a break, something as simple as just literally being able to take a vacation? How do we give them the tools and the insight in terms of whether that actually has any impact in terms of how their videos show up in recommendations, etc? Those are always ongoing conversations with our creators. I personally get input from creators along those dimensions, and we have a team on my team that’s focused on building out those sets of tools for our creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWYCv0"&gt;We’re talking a lot about distribution and monetization, [but] one of the big areas of feedback that I get from our creators that factors into their overall experience with YouTube is how they interact with their fans, the comments below videos. That is an area that is oftentimes incredibly rich. You can see some of the most amazing conversations there around picking apart a physics video or something like that. But it’s also an area where I feel like sometimes our creators in the past have been getting overwhelmed, just with the sheer volume, or even sometimes the tone of the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCyFr"&gt;So we’ve built a whole slew of tools to help creators manage that both in an automated fashion, like moderated comments, a much better ranking of those types of comments, etc. That’s an example of how we’ve taken feedback from our creators and tried to turn it into tools that allow creators to have a much better experience managing their channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRL4fU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the theses I have on the show is that distribution platforms have a direct effect on the kind of media that is made. This is historically true: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/26/18514953/disco-invention-changed-pop-music-12-inch-single"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12-inch singles made for longer disco songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb55Dk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I look at YouTube, and I look at all the things you’re describing, and all the pressures and the ad pressures, and I talk to YouTubers, and it comes up every time: the combination of rules around monetization and the [pressure] to win the recommendation algorithm means that YouTube titles are always hyperbolic, the thumbnails are over the top, and videos always hit 10 minutes so you can get one of the midroll [advertising] slots in. Those pressures, they just create that product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFOws6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I could abstractly describe that kind of YouTube video to anyone, and they could immediately think of a video they’ve seen that fits that exact mold. Do you think you need to ease the pressure on the product so it stops producing that kind of thing? Because I’m not sure everyone loves that kind of video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzNC15"&gt;The way that I think about it is, ultimately the way the YouTube system works, so the way our product works is a reflection of, again, some of these core north star metrics — how satisfied are our viewers? Are they getting what they want out of their connection with their creators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHKIuz"&gt;Similarly, for creators, we have similar ways of looking at it. And so two things that I’ll call out that are, even up-leveling, the way that you described it, that I think about are, do we feel like the core milestones for our creators are correct, and are they healthy? So, for example, are there lots of creators that are getting started on YouTube? Is it dramatically harder to get started? Is it easier? How do we measure that? What’s the velocity of creators getting started? I can tell you that that’s something that not just my creator teams, but all of the YouTube teams look at carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dcDOuE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creator feedback often focuses on building connectivity with an audience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3E4hfO"&gt;So that’s sort of at the beginning of the journey, if you will. We also — to the second part of your question around monetization — one of the key milestones we look at is how many creators on our platform, new creators, are able to have a sustainable living on our platform? And we actually measure that, not just here in the US, but around the world, [adjusted] according to purchasing power parity and the like. Those are not perfect because they’re measuring snapshots in time. But again, just to kind of peel the onion back a little bit, those are things that I look at pretty closely, because I think they are fundamental ways of answering the questions that you’re describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwOOqV"&gt;Are we actually still creating a place where new people with new ideas can come, get started, find an audience? And once they find that audience, are we building products and capabilities that allow them to stop whatever else they were doing, and actually earn a living on YouTube if they want to become full-time YouTubers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yqlOL"&gt;And those are metrics we look at literally on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis to make sure that we’re doing the right thing by our creators. When I talk to creators, the feedback that I get is around, “What are the new types of tools and capabilities you’re building to help me continue to connect better with my audience?” Every single question or feature request I get ultimately boils back down to that in some flavor. And there might be a monetization objective behind it, there might be just a “growing an audience” objective behind it, but it really is about connectivity with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7ZJPe"&gt;And so I gave you the genesis of Shorts, that’s one example. Everything I talked to you about with respect to comments and how creators can manage that, it’s all about connectivity to an audience, even a lot of the monetization products we’ve developed. There’s ads, but we have eight or nine other products that allow creators to monetize on our platform. And the fundamental thread to all of them is actually connecting with the audience. And so whether it’s Super Chat or Super Stickers or channel memberships. And so that’s always, for me, the fundamental question that I get when I speak with our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEGkcF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543655/patreon-ceo-decoder-interview-jack-conte"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We had Jack Conte from Patreon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on the show. He said, “I started Patreon because I put music videos on YouTube and I was getting no return. You need an independent relationship with your audience that’s outside of the platforms.” I hear this argument a lot. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLjC8B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve built a suite of products where the entire relationship a person has [with their audience], could be through YouTube. Everything they do comes through YouTube and one of its products. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQBaBV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You run a business. Do you think it’s smart for a creator to have one supplier, one platform vendor, or should creators be distributed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyPTza"&gt;I will say that I think it’s great that creators have multiple ways that they can generate revenue. If you talk to YouTube employees, I think many of them will tell you this, what’s really cool and inspiring about YouTube is that it creates this platform for YouTubers where — of course they can monetize on YouTube, and I gave you super detailed metrics in terms of how we actually measure the health of that for our creators, but lots of creators start on YouTube, but then they diversify in terms of their revenue streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4dpja"&gt;I know you talk to YouTubers all the time: many of them have written books. Many of them have shows on other platforms or on television, or what have you. Many of them have built audiences elsewhere. All of that is awesome, from our perspective on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxdFfX"&gt;What I also hear from creators, often, is that their core, most authentic, most deeply engaged, leaned-forward audience, is on YouTube. I hear that over and over, from our largest creators, to up-and-coming creators, to literally creators who’ve only been on the platform for a few months. That is the reason why we also want to give them the choice to be able to monetize beyond ads on YouTube itself. That doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t or can’t use other products or capabilities to earn a living on our platform, but what I hear is that seamless integration within YouTube with their core audience is what’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gs3GUz"&gt;I’ll connect it to what I said previously, which is the reason why these monetization tools have worked so well for our creators is because they’re not just about helping the creators make money, they also help them enhance their connection with their fans on YouTube. Look at a product like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14249630/youtube-super-chat-pay-pin-comments-live-stream"&gt;Super Chat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949437/youtube-live-streams-super-stickers-chat-cartoons-twitch-revenue"&gt;Super Stickers&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it’s a way for a creator to generate revenue from a live chat that’s happening on a stream, but it’s also a way for them to connect with specific users, specific fans. They give them shout-outs, and they build a community that way. Those two things are reinforcing. I think that that is what’s really cool about all of these monetization products that we’ve built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEHZEy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube is also a search engine, right? You can show up on YouTube, you’re not part of anyone’s audience. You’re just bouncing between home repair videos. How do you think about that audience? Does it belong to the creators? Does it belong to you? Is it a mix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2MjEd"&gt;I feel like that audience wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t for the connection they have with those creators. I have three kids. They have their favorite sets of creators on our platform. Back to my stage analogy, we want to build the world’s best stage, but it really is about the people in the audience connecting with the people that are on the stage. That is the magic of YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBvV5p"&gt;That is our creators’ fanbase, the audience that they’ve built. Our creators say that all the time. We enable it through our platform. Our platform allows them to get scale. One of the cool things that I like about a creator’s experience on a platform like YouTube is they can share an idea, and it can be received by somebody on the other side of the world in a way that’s incredibly powerful and inspiring. That happens on YouTube all the time. That’s really the way I think about it, and the tools that we’ve built are along those lines too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxgOM9"&gt;You gave an example I thought was interesting, around people searching on YouTube, “how to fix my garage door,” or what have you. I would say, there, too, there’s a means to actually create a connection between me as a viewer and that particular creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwQX1f"&gt;I had to make an adjustment to the water heater in my house. There was an awesome video on YouTube that enabled me to do it. It probably saved me like two hours of time and probably several hundred dollars to do that. We just launched a product called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584330/youtube-tipping-feature-super-thanks"&gt;Super Thanks&lt;/a&gt;, because I think it was certainly worth $10 from me to that creator, because that creator delivered enormous value for me. Am I going to watch that creator’s videos on heater repair every week? Probably not, but I still connected with that creator. That’s an example of another monetization product that’s about connectivity, but also allowing that creator to make money. That’s how I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNBUFD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advertising products on traditional YouTube are very direct, right? You watch a video, there’s some breaks, the ads play. Some percentage of that revenue goes to the creator. With Shorts, there’s not a one-to-one. You watch Shorts, you scroll, an interstitial plays, and then this new Shorts program is going to deliver bonus payments somehow, from $100 to $10,000. How does that program actually work? How do you determine the value that creators get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLTyq4"&gt;I’ll say a few things about it. First, it is really the first step. That’s why we’ve described it as a finite Shorts fund, I think it’s $100 million through the end of next year, because it is a means by which my team’s goal is to develop what we hope will be the long-term, scalable monetization program for Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in3qlX"&gt;I think you should put it in that context, which is a way to get going and to actually really start to figure out a way to describe how monetization can work for Shorts creators. Because you’re right. The experience is very different. You’re essentially consuming a feed of Shorts, and so the model has to work differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hIaxHP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Payment for Shorts take into account engagement at the account level, not just an individual video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBO8TK"&gt;You obviously have the standard eligibility criteria, to be in good standing in terms of our community guidelines, [be] over 13 years old. We’re starting in 10 countries, although we want to expand beyond that very quickly. [You’re eligible for the Shorts payment] every single month based on viewership metrics, engagement metrics at the channel level, and if you obviously have created a Short in the last, I think, 180 days, is the cutoff we have right now. You will then qualify for a payment which, as you described, is between $100 and $10,000. That criteria could change, but it’s roughly on the order of viewership and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nuuem7"&gt;That’s one of the things we want to learn, is, how do we actually measure [engagement] well? How do we measure that in a way that can be transparent with our creators? I think a lot of that learning will come about through the Shorts fund. It might vary regionally because audiences are different in different regions. The addressable viewership is different. Those are all the types of things that we’re looking at, but that’s roughly how the program is designed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za2k0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to make sure we spend some time at the end here on trust and safety. As far as I can tell, it is unique that the trust and safety organization reports to you as the head of product. Why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4U4W8"&gt;First, it’s hard to imagine a YouTube product experience without taking into account how the community guidelines impact our viewers and our creators. We spent the last hour talking about all of these products and features, and the decisions that go behind creating them. I would argue that a core part of that overall product experience for our entire ecosystem — viewers, creators, advertisers — are our community guidelines and how they work. That’s the first thing that I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBmvdd"&gt;The second thing is a little bit more subtle, but I think in some ways is even more critical in terms of how YouTube works, which is [that] when we talk about content moderation or community guidelines, we tend to focus on [a] very, very small portion of what happens there, which is videos that stay up or come down on the platform. That is not by any means the be-all and end-all of how content manifests itself for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zr6btp"&gt;What I mean by that is it’s not just about videos that come down or stay up, it’s also about how our recommendation systems work. It’s about how the ranking system works. It’s about how our search systems work. It’s also about how creators, 99.9 percent of whom are looking to do the right thing, are rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tb79MP"&gt;In terms of our responsibility to our ecosystem, to all of our viewers as a global platform, the way I think about it is this four Rs framework that we have — again, going back to first principles and frameworks. Only the first R is about removing content that’s violative of our community guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z0YDQ"&gt;We have three other Rs: Raising up authoritative content. You’ve seen this in the context of the pandemic that we’re living through. We have information panels. We have a COVID news shelf that runs on your home feed every single day that has videos from authoritative news sources, from health authorities, etc. We raise up authoritative content when it comes to people looking for news or medical misinformation, critical information like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8I4x"&gt;We also reduce content in our recommendations and ranking algorithms when they are not clearly community-guideline violative, but could be borderline for other reasons, harmful misinformation, etc, where oftentimes the lines are very blurry and not clear. What’s the line between political speech and misinformation? We might reduce the recommendations of that type of content in users’ feeds. That’s the third R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWEnMH"&gt;We bring it all together with the fourth R, which we call reward, which is orienting the monetization resources towards those creators that are looking to do the right thing, build an audience, build a business on YouTube. I just would say that all four of those Rs are actually what govern the overall experience for our users. We tend to always focus the conversation on the first R, but don’t realize that those other three Rs oftentimes play an order or two orders of magnitude more impactful role in terms of number of videos on YouTube than just what we remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhUVl9"&gt;All of that is seamlessly integrated into how the product works. Everything I described to you is around our ranking algorithms, in terms of how the UX works. Where do these all show up? How do they show up? What’s the language of them? Can they click through? How do our monetization programs work? Those are all products that we built for our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozaPxI"&gt;I think viewing them as two separate things is actually doing a disservice to the entire ecosystem. It is creating a situation where you can’t actually develop the right set of products and services you need to address this challenge in a holistic fashion. You’re just focused myopically on one sliver of it, that I would argue is in some ways maybe the most high-profile because it’s very clear to see, but in other ways, the least impactful in terms of what’s actually happening on the platform. It’s a bit of a long answer to your question, but I wanted to give you that full color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4fUHP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s focus on two of the Rs, raise and reduce. That’s the recommendation algorithm. That’s, “We’re going to show more people good videos, authoritative videos. We’re going to show fewer people the videos that are fuzzy.” How big is the team that runs the recommendation algorithm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spGuYm"&gt;I can’t get into the specific numbers of the team, but there’s dozens of engineers, and product managers, and UX designers who are making tweaks and improvements to our algorithms on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OFUSW"&gt;By the way, one thing that I would just clarify is it’s not just about recommendations and ranking in our home feed, on search, etc. It’s also about products and features that we bring to bear, like information panels or search result panels. For example, if you search for “COVID information” or “coronavirus information” on YouTube, you will get a full panel that has information, including text, from health authorities, whether it’s the CDC, or, in other parts of the world, the World Health Organization, or whoever their national health authority is. It’s not just about how our recommendation algorithms work, it’s about how the entire product works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpLzZh"&gt;In fact, the COVID panel, that you’ve probably seen underneath videos or in feeds in many places, I think has received on the order of 600 billion impressions since March of last year. We’re going to continue to run it, because we believe it’s a good source of information as users are making decisions with respect to the health of their family, whether they should get vaccinated or not. ... Raise and reduce are, yes, about recommendations, but they’re also about all of these other products that we give to our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARGl1C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would put all this in the category of discovery. You’ve got a lot of discovery features, but I want to stay focused on recommendations. I’m assuming there’s a single main PM for recommendations, a product manager for recommendations. What are her [key performance indicators]? When you do OKRs at Google, what are her KPIs for the recommendation algorithm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3d6Fzw"&gt;What I’ll say is our recommendations team is a fairly large team across YouTube, so it’s not just one product manager, there’s a number of them, but I’ll give you a few things. Maybe to give you even more insight,  I’ll actually give you kind of the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOAdMH"&gt;You’ve been, obviously, very familiar with YouTube since the early days. You’ll remember that, in the very early days, one of the things that we looked at were things like views of a video as a signal of whether that video was interesting, or not, or what have you. That was obviously not sufficient, because it would lead to some of the things that you mentioned earlier, like, clickbaity thumbnails, or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHd75y"&gt;Then we evolved to measuring not just the views, but the viewership of the videos. Are people actually watching the entire video? That factored into the overall KPIs of how that team thought about it. We’ve evolved since then, recognizing that it’s not just about that type of engagement, but it’s about long-term satisfaction of our viewers. That’s why you see some of those questions that you get directly in the feed that ask you how you felt about that video, that channel. That was an evolution. KPIs then evolve around satisfaction of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KD2Uez"&gt;Then we’ve layered another on top of that, which is related to this overall responsibility framework that I described. Which is, how do we measure whether we are doing a good job in our recommendation algorithms to raise up authoritative content or reduce some of this borderline content, or however you want to call it? We have KPIs around that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OybO0i"&gt;One of the ones that combines a number of these Rs is one that we actually released a couple months ago now. It’s called &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/building-greater-transparency-and-accountability/"&gt;violative view rate&lt;/a&gt;, VVR for short. I think the latest number that we had was, I think, somewhere on the order of like 0.16 percent to 0.18 percent. It fluctuates, of course. That is a core north star metric that this team would be OKRed on. What it measures is, in a sample-based way, the number of videos, weighted by viewership, or views, that were deemed to be violative of our community guidelines. Of course, the goal of our teams, the KPI, is to drive that down as near as possible to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMAag6"&gt;That is a challenging task. We’ve driven that number down dramatically over the course of the last year and a half, two years since we’ve been measuring that in earnest. But that’s an example of something that that team would get OKRed on and treat as one of their core north star metrics for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbZXHP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big criticisms of recommendations — I’m sure you have an answer for it — is the radicalization funnel. We hear about it over and over again with YouTube. We’ve heard there have been big internal debates inside of YouTube about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how the recommendation algorithm fueled radicalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji7A2J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that something you’re measuring? Is that something you have a handle on, and you can turn it off and show people more viewpoints, or keep them out of the radicalization funnel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUETEP"&gt;As you can imagine, there’s a lot to that question. I think what I will say is that we have looked at this internally. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;external studies&lt;/a&gt; on this. I think there was one a few months ago that was &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2101967118"&gt;a joint study at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard&lt;/a&gt; that didn’t find any of this. They felt that YouTube viewership was really just a reflection of media consumption habits, just in the world in general. There’s been studies in both directions. It’s obviously a really hard thing to measure, because each individual user’s journey is different. In an aggregate level you could look at things, but that’s not to say that I’m dismissing any individual viewer’s own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZSpXt"&gt;I’ll just point back to the fact that the best way I know how to address all of this in a holistic sense is to really focus on those two pillars of raise and reduce. That is a way that we can determine what our north star principles and metrics should be and really work towards those. Yes, I look at things like, “are we doing a good job of raising up authoritative content,” especially in those contexts that I described. It is a continuous journey. I will be the first to say that we are not perfect, and we can always get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TA749"&gt;We also do the same thing on the reduce side. I gave you a very detailed explanation of how that works. That’s what my team is focused on on a weekly basis, and we do measure ourselves on those in terms of whether we’re hitting those metrics. That is the best way I know how to make sure that our recommendations are doing what we think is the right thing by our viewers and our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJboOt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other major YouTube content moderation system that is of particular interest to me is Content ID. When I talk to YouTubers, right at the top of the list [of frustrations] is the automated copyright system that exists in YouTube. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTVJXB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of it’s out of your hands, right? There’s the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, there’s notice and takedown. There’s a lot going on there. But it is the largest automated copyright enforcement system in the history of the world. How do you think it’s going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njW82A"&gt;Just from a product and technology standpoint, I do think that it is one of the most critical aspects of the YouTube experience for our creators, but also for our rights holders. In some sense, it’s what has enabled a lot of the incredible user experiences that happen on YouTube. Again, like I said, with our other product areas, all of these products are capabilities that we want to continue to make better year on year, month on month, I would say that when it comes to Content ID, we really do try to strike the balance as best as possible. You mentioned some of the constraints, of course, that this whole world exists under, but again, tying it back to principles, our core principle there is trying to balance the needs of rights holders with content creators on our platform. For example, if we’re having a product review discussion around something like Content ID, it is trying to balance that core set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uAABZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you think Content ID needs to improve right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrZgFY"&gt;I think that one area that we have been focused on is really around ease of use and transparency. You described DMCA. You described all of these constraints. That’s a really complicated world that exists out there. There’s lots and lots of lawyers that are very focused on it in terms of both protecting rights, creating fair-use use cases, etc. So I think one of the things that YouTube has done and I think we can continue to do is just offer more transparency on that in our tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMEyOv"&gt;So how do we build those capabilities for our creators and rights holders in a seamless way? We’ve done that. I also think that accessibility of the tools, that’s an area that we’ve been very focused on. I think you’ve seen just over the last couple years how we’ve expanded access to those tools in a way that works for a much larger set of creators. So those are the types of things that I think you can see us continue to invest in going into next year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erAwUN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to tie these two ideas together. Content ID is the largest automated content moderation system at scale. It has a bunch of constraints, but it runs. People can issue strikes. It is contentious. And so you probably know more about the pitfalls of automated content moderation than anybody, except for maybe the people on your team that actually run it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mp0sX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next to that, you have a recommendation algorithm, you have principles around it, you have community guidelines, you have AI content moderation. It’s all building towards another kind of automated moderation system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wh8x8V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you learned from Content ID that’s going to shape the future of your community guidelines moderation and what are you going to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFzKDo"&gt;I think that’s a really interesting lens to look at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16NcDT"&gt;I would say the common thread between those two pieces is what I believe technology is good at — what machine learning classifiers can do well — is around scale and speed. That sounds obvious, but that is where a lot of the focus here is. And in the realm of Content ID, I believe that it has served rights holders, as well as content creators well. There’s always more we can do, but in general, that has been a system that has enabled billions of dollars worth of economic value for both of those constituents over the course of many years on our platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saZx6j"&gt;I would say the difference between something like that and the broad realm of content moderation is [that] machine learning and algorithms can do that first part around scale and speed, but I have also learned that it is important to have a highly trained group of individuals all over the world to be able to make the actual decisions, the nuanced decisions around our content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoWmlq"&gt;So what machine learning classifiers are really good at is identifying a set of videos, or comments that are candidates for potentially being violative of our community guidelines. But where they often fall short is in terms of the actual decisions about whether that candidate video is actually truly violative or not. My learning, over the course of the last three or four years being really focused on this — and again, this is one of the reasons why it’s such a core part of our product organization — is that those two things are fundamentally tied together. In order to achieve what we are looking to achieve and drive that violative view rate number down as low as possible, it really has to be a combination of machines because they bring us scale and speed, but also highly trained individuals that can take our enforcement guidelines and apply them to videos in a systematic way, thousands and thousands of times a day to achieve the best possible results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17rRgG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that moderator workforce work for Google? Is that part of your team or is that contractors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9Zujs"&gt;We have multiple components of this. But at the highest level we do have employees of YouTube that are part of that team. And then we also have an extended workforce in offices all over the world where we work with partners to really wrap that up in terms of scale and numbers. And they’re all incredibly highly trained, always going through training in terms of new policies and enforcement guidelines, also are provided resources in terms of helping address a lot of the challenges of their work because it is obviously very challenging work. And so it’s a combination of full-time YouTube employees, as well as our extended workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VCPvG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I hear from people in the larger conversation around platform moderation is we spend all of our time looking at Twitter and all of our time yelling at Facebook. And YouTube slides along in the background. It’s a frustration I hear from academics and even other reporters that YouTube doesn’t seem to get the attention that Twitter — in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;particular&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Twitter — gets. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pe6m1H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you still paying attention to the debates? Around [Section] 230? Around the guidelines for misinformation? Does that influence you or are you waiting for someone in Congress to wake up and haul you in front of a hearing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpAh1M"&gt;I mean, everything I talked about with respect to our responsibility as a global platform is something that I pay attention to, [that] Susan [Wojcicki] pays attention to. It is literally my number one priority. It is the thing that I pay attention to more than anything else. And the reason I pay attention to it is less for the reasons you’re describing and more because I believe it is a fundamental part of our viewers and our creators and our partners’ experience on YouTube. It is core to how they experience the product. So it is my number one priority. It is the highest set of OKRs and goals that I have and my team has. And that’s the reason why we’re focused on it. It’s the reason why we have thousands of people working on it every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPbinS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to let you off easy with lightning round. You just have to tell me over and over again that you can’t talk about future features. Don’t worry. It’s going to be easy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EreYRH"&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM1Vur"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube wasn’t in 4K on the Apple TV for the longest time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299637/apple-tv-youtube-4k-tvos-14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and now it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. What changed? What was that fight with Apple like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JtlhV"&gt;I don’t think I can get into the specifics of that. But I’ll just say that our goal is to try to bring all of these features to all of our surfaces as quickly as possible. And sometimes we’re just constrained by the reality of the various platforms. But the goal from a product standpoint is to try to bring it as quickly as we can to all of our surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUuLva"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you win that argument or did they?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npcj1P"&gt;I don’t think I can get into specifics of any of the ongoing conversations we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byBD7Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to note for the listener that Neal was grinning and you can just interpret that however you want. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKdVjR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two, when can I watch YouTube at 1.5 speed on a television? Because I cannot do that on my Chromecast or my Apple TV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVcfmn"&gt;It is a good question. So I can’t ... Again, I can’t give you specific timelines, but you should know that’s not the first time I’ve heard that request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YZIvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. Put it at the top of the pile. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZqsLg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; YouTube viewership on TVs, smart TVs in particular, is skyrocketing. You also make YouTube TV. So now you have two apps with very different business models that are competitive. Do you think core YouTube will overtake YouTube TV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuZ4kM"&gt;Overtake in terms of viewership on living room devices? Is that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjryUR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;YouTube on television just replace television?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsymub"&gt;That is not a lightning round question. &lt;em&gt;[laughs]&lt;/em&gt; That is a very involved answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYshQo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a yes or a no — there’s a way to answer that that is a lightning round answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N5xXu"&gt;I don’t see that in any time in the near future. There’s two different use cases there as you know through your own experience. Linear broadcast or cable is still very different, primarily driven by things like news and sports, from the video-on-demand world of YouTube. Stay tuned for how we’re thinking about those things in the future, but today they’re very different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zEwEy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube TV, another product that you are responsible for, recapitulates a cable bundle. The price of it is going back up towards the price of a standard cable bundle. What’s the future of that product? Does it remain a big linear TV bundle or are you going to disaggregate it in some way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrlXP4"&gt;I shouldn’t talk about how we’re thinking about it in the future. What I would say is there’s the economic realities of how content pricing works and the like. A lot of what you’ve seen in YouTube TV in terms of the new channels that we’ve added have been driven by user demand. Users have asked for that content to be explicitly added to the bundle as it exists on YouTube TV. So that’s what you’ve seen there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArbtL9"&gt;We are also very focused on making it easy for users to add add-ons, to give them the flexibility of what else they’re looking for in the package. And we’re also doing more around either content-vertical type bundles or even feature type bundles. You saw that with the 4K bundle on YouTube TV. So we’re trying to bring more choice to our users. And a lot of it is, frankly, just driven by the feedback that we hear from YouTube TV users. There’s not another any price hike or anything in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcbL7y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When can I watch YouTube TV picture-in-picture on my phone or my iPad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVJYKY"&gt;That is not something that I think I have a timeline on. And there’s more to that than just some of the technology enablement, but I don’t think I have a timeline to give you on that today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjPc3w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a contract problem, not a technology problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMF33U"&gt;I may not have all the details on that specifically, but there’s lots of pieces that go into that. But again, like I said, I know that’s something that our users have asked for. Are you looking for that around normal picture-in-picture use cases like sports?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLyp3N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpkNmp"&gt;That’s the core use case, yeah. Yeah. I’ve heard that before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEr1n1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I run a team. There are things I want on the site and I can’t get them to the top of my pile. You’re the [product] boss of YouTube. What’s the feature you want that you can’t get to the top of the pile?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9ZDxO"&gt;Oh, wow. That’s really interesting. In the realm of Shorts, for example, it’s not a feature-complete product. There’s lots of things that I would like to see and I am by no means a talented creator at all. But I play around with all of our products. You mentioned some of the ones that I would like to see, which are: better filters, better editing tools, etc., for that product. And of course, I’d like to see it sooner rather than later, but I also know our teams are working on it. So that’s probably the latest and greatest thing that I’ve called out. But I think that if you asked me that two weeks ago, I probably would have said a different set of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMbnHA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we’ll have you back in two weeks and we’ll ask it again. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMMZv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for YouTube? What should people be looking for from your team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrPGvt"&gt;I think we touched on so much here. I think that I’ll just say at the highest level you should continue to see us invest both on the creator side and the viewer side around the concept of mobile creation, Shorts as one example of that. We talked a lot about that and you’ll continue to see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYNPjA"&gt;I think another big area of investment is continuing to develop streams for our monetization for our creators. I talked about Super Thanks — we literally just launched that a week or two ago. There’s more to be done there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwskrT"&gt;One area that we didn’t talk about that’s related to that, that I’m really excited about because it also helps connect viewers and creators is shopping and commerce. That is something that I think I’m particularly excited about. And then the thing that I know for sure on the overall roadmap, that will remain at the top of it going into next year, also is all the work that we do from a product standpoint, policy standpoint, around our responsibility efforts. So that’s one thing I know, even though we’re not in planning season for next year, that I think will be at the top of the list, will be that, because it always is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube ‘Premium Lite’ subscription offers ad-free viewing for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6NECyPc8xuv3SWADeaSNCuItoQ=/0x0:1622x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69665466/image__13_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premium Lite offers ad-free viewing at a lower price.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRLkpV"&gt;Google is piloting a more affordable premium subscription tier for YouTube that offers ad-free viewing without YouTube Premium’s other features like offline downloads or background playback. The new “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite"&gt;Premium Lite&lt;/a&gt;” plan was &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-sub-is-a-thing-now-in-select-countries.465198/"&gt;spotted by a user on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;, and YouTube subsequently confirmed the test offering in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Premium Lite is currently being tested in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkVuqp"&gt;“In Nordics and Benelux (except for Iceland), we’re testing a new offering to give users even more choice: Premium Lite costs €6.99/month (or local equivalent per month) and it includes ad-free videos on YouTube,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. In comparison, YouTube’s existing Premium plan costs around €11.99 a month in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Z0wbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re testing a new offering to give users even more choice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQkv3n"&gt;Premium Lite includes ad-free viewing across YouTube’s main app on web, iOS, Android, smart TVs, and games consoles, as well as in the YouTube Kids app. However, it doesn’t include any YouTube Music benefits like ad-free listening, and it doesn’t include &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6308116?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cyoutube-music-premium%2Cyoutube-originals"&gt;Premium’s other features&lt;/a&gt; like background playback (for when you want to switch to another app while continuing to listen to audio from a YouTube video), or offline downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV8IOv"&gt;Speaking as someone who hates the amount of ads on YouTube, but isn’t too interested in Premium’s other features like offline downloads, Premium Lite sounds like a tempting proposition. But at its current pricing, it costs around 60 percent of the price of a regular Premium subscription, while only offering around a quarter of its benefits. YouTube says that the current subscription is in an experimental phase, however, and that it’s considering rolling out more plans based on audience feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanks to the Rickroll, ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ hits 1 billion YouTube plays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of Rick ASTLEY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tAylZJ29DTAFX3fXTtrB1vRRx0=/0x0:2661x1774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661138/85355127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bernd Muller/Redferns&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0sSB6w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt; for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up” has surpassed 1 billion plays on YouTube. The song became a lasting part of internet culture thanks to the Rickroll meme and reached the impressive milestone a couple days ago. Astley took to the video’s comments to share his gratitude, saying “amazing, crazy, wonderful!” In a video posted to Instagram, he added “the world is a wonderful and beautiful place, and I am very lucky.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE9AtU"&gt;With some songs having crossed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk"&gt;as many as 7 billion views&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the 1 billion club isn’t quite as prestigious as it once was. But the achievement goes to show the staying power of the Rickroll prank. The video hit daily views of 2.3 million on April Fools Day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9607871/rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-video-billion-views/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just in the past couple years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138550/fortnite-rickroll-new-emote-never-gonna-give-you-up-rick-astley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; emotes&lt;/a&gt; and fan-made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22289657/never-gonna-give-you-up-4k"&gt;4K remasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctDWy"&gt;Back in 2008, the man himself &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL-hNMJvcyI"&gt;Rickrolled the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;. The meme was also put to excellent use when the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDs7KkGcQ6M"&gt;San Diego Padres trolled the Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; just as fans thought they were about to belt out the chorus to “Sweet Caroline.” If you’ve got other prime examples, the comments section awaits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joVsmq"&gt;I’m curious what the average watch time is for “Never Gonna Give You Up.” After being duped, how many people have closed out the window in aggravation within seconds of hearing the drum intro and synths coming in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="874YsE"&gt;Astley celebrated joining the billion plays club by releasing a limited, &lt;a href="https://rickastley.tmstor.es/?lf=f8891a33f848b3f0690358b04f4f6543"&gt;already-sold-out&lt;/a&gt; run of 7-inch blue vinyl pressings of the quintessential ‘80s jam. &lt;/p&gt;
