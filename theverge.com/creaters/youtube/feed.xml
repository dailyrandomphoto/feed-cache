    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor Shorts will soon let users sample audio from any YouTube video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zGM5zd"&gt;Being able to sample audio from other users’ videos is one of TikTok’s greatest strengths. It allows memes to percolate across the platform and lets users discover new content by watching videos with the same sound. Soon, YouTube will expand this feature in its TikTok competitor, Shorts, letting users sample sounds from &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; content uploaded to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLFHxU"&gt;YouTube officially announced this feature last month in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/108706620/introducing-a-new-way-to-create-shorts-with-audio-from-across-youtube?"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, but tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it should now be available for the first time in new markets as part of the launch of Shorts in the UK, Canada, and a number of Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela). The YouTube-sampling tool will then roll out to other Shorts markets including the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXmlZ"&gt;Shorts users can already sample sounds from other Shorts videos (as well as from a library of licensed music). But this update will greatly expand the audio they have easy access to. The feature will funnel YouTube users into its Shorts feature via a new “Create” button in the mobile app. This will appear underneath videos next to the like and dislike buttons. Clicking it will give users the option to sample the video’s audio in Shorts. Shorts viewers will also be able to tap the audio in any video to head back to the original source in YouTube proper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tq9HhbgKPWeDKzNTNgJzbI484aA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642212/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.51.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorts videos sampling audio from YouTube will link back to the original source. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk31t1"&gt;This feature will allow longform creators “to benefit by allowing the community to find something interesting in their video,” YouTube’s product lead for Shorts, Todd Sherman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Shorts users can create something with the sample audio, he says, and the creators of the audio will “get perhaps inbound traffic or exposure from that. From the longform creator perspective I think a lot of folks are excited to have their things remixed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtDsA"&gt;Not all creators are happy about this, though. After YouTubers noticed a new check-box in the settings for their video uploads that gives Shorts users access to their audio, many complained that this would let people “steal” their content. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youtube+shorts+permissions"&gt;Search for &lt;/a&gt;“YouTube Shorts permissions” on YouTube itself and you’ll find plenty of videos worrying about exactly this scenario, with thumbnails posing questions like: “YouTube legalized video stealing?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQuKAw"&gt;The permissions box seems to have been introduced before Shorts users were actually able to sample audio from YouTube videos. Right now it has to be unticked manually for each video, but Sherman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is working on a bulk opt-out option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wxwQAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br&gt;YouTube suddenly automatically checked "Yes" on EVERY YouTube video to allow them to be re-uploaded as Shorts on OTHER channels ???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let your YouTuber friends know that they have to go through and uncheck this setting on every video or risk stolen content... &lt;a href="https://t.co/b4rjiwmE2c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b4rjiwmE2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mysticat #Mysty200k (@MysticatLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MysticatLive/status/1388191677836414977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnPnbj"&gt;A YouTube-sampling feature could create other problems, too. A huge array of content has been uploaded to YouTube over the years, much of it sensitive or personal in nature. The uploaders of this content won’t necessarily want their videos to be sampled as this could enable harassment or abuse. Despite this, the sampling feature will be opt-out rather than opt-in. That means all YouTube videos will be sampleable by default, and creators will have to specify which videos they don’t want to be used in Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE6PRN"&gt;Sherman says YouTube is aware of these potential problems, but that the company’s discussions with creators has indicated more excitement. “There is some concern about examples of videos that you might think are personal or sensitive and that’s why creators have asked for the ability to opt out. But they also seem to recognize that it sort of doesn’t work if it’s very selectively an opt-in,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zppWbr"&gt;YouTube originally launched Shorts last September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India&lt;/a&gt; before bringing the feature to the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286286/youtube-shorts-us-rollout-product-features-updates-chapters-monetization-neal-mohan"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay $100 million to creators&lt;/a&gt; to use the app, though exactly how much individual creators can earn isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the band making a giant marble-based instrument</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZdxfCQt9UM2I1F3rHBvUSNuowQ=/57x0:1737x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330324/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_3.10.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This machine plays marbles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wintergatan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eURomX"&gt;Swedish band Wintergatan may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/2/11147884/marble-machine-music-wintergartan-martin-molin"&gt;widely known for its Marble Machine music video&lt;/a&gt; (which featured a machine dropping marbles to play drums, a bass, and other instruments), but today I learned that they’re building a bigger, better version, and documenting the entire process on YouTube. It’s called the Marble Machine X, and it’s driven by a motor instead of a hand crank, is being built by an entire team of people, and, hopefully will be able to go on tour and be played on stage when it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXIhmY"&gt;Wintergartan also produced a build log of the first machine, but this new project is way grander in scope, offering a deeper look at the creative process that leads to... well, building a massive musical instrument that uses marbles. The band put out eight build videos for the original machine before it released its debut music video — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv"&gt;the build log for the Marble Machine X&lt;/a&gt; is at 161 videos and counting. (If you were looking for something to do this weekend, that’s quite a backlog of delightfully nerdy content to fill your time with!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBcKRq"&gt;It also turns out that, when you’re building a machine made to sling marbles to make tunes, almost every part of that process is interesting. The music nerd in me squealed in delight when Martin Molin, the band member that’s working with a team to build the machine, showed off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;the 28-audio channel cable&lt;/a&gt; they’re using to keep the machine looking clean and wire-free. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;fascinating video that first got me hooked&lt;/a&gt;, where he shows off an immaculately-crafted wood piece that sorts marbles equally into four tracks. Or, rather, the piece of wood that doesn’t do that job properly, which is why he’s now designing a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IvTXF7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ygofdm9JB3g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyNi5X"&gt;The videos aren’t exactly obscure: Wintergatan has over 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube, and some of the videos about the Marble Machine X have close to that number of views. But somehow I, someone who routinely watches videos about people building &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYLBjScgb7o"&gt;weird, awesome instruments&lt;/a&gt;, had just missed it until now, so I figured I’d share the joy in case the YouTube algorithm had also kept this hidden from you. I can’t wait to hear Wintergatan fully turn the thing on, and do an epic remaster of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q"&gt;original Marble Machine song&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube pulled its community captions feature, so now more creators are making their own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration depicting hands holding up captions on a YouTube video." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYzRXztJ17pcN7j6UVEzL4H7dNQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322838/acastro_210518_4590_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEKmjf"&gt;Jack Edwards doesn’t want to be praised for doing what he considers the bare minimum: making his videos accessible to his deaf and hard of hearing viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E7gbv"&gt;Edwards began making book and lifestyle videos on YouTube five years ago, but he only started captioning all of his videos in January. “It was one of my goals this year to invest more time into making my channel more accessible for viewers,” he says. “I always think about the quote, ‘It’s a privilege to learn, rather than to experience,’ and that’s true for so many accessibility issues. I don’t rely on subtitles to enjoy YouTube content, so it’s easy to forget that others do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5nOSHr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Captions are up 30 percent year to year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95Vhnw"&gt;More creators like Edwards have been writing captions for their videos over the past year, providing subtitles so that more viewers can engage with their content without having to hear or understand the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5vAcn"&gt;It’s a result deaf campaigners considered almost impossible about a year ago, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;YouTube nixed community caption contributions&lt;/a&gt;. Most YouTube channels don’t upload captions for their videos, so it fell on subscribers to volunteer high-quality subtitles for fellow viewers to read. Yet, in September, YouTube &lt;a href="https://liamodell.com/2020/09/28/youtube-community-captions-translations-ccs-dontremoveyoutubeccs-creator-insider-deaf-rikki-poynter-amara/"&gt;scrapped the feature&lt;/a&gt; allowing for viewer-submitted captions, citing “low usage” and “abuse.” Creators had to start making captions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k35M9O"&gt;When the plans were &lt;a href="https://teneightymagazine.com/2020/04/24/youtube-to-review-community-captions-feature/"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, deaf YouTuber Rikki Poynter, a prolific captions campaigner, gave me a very bleak forecast. “Community contributions gave us more captioned channels and now we will risk having less of that.” Half a million people signed &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-don-t-remove-community-captions-from-youtube"&gt;an online petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on YouTube to reverse the decision, and thousands of Twitter users got the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontRemoveYoutubeCCs?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#DontRemoveYouTubeCCs&lt;/a&gt; trending in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJjZEa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Viewers have encouraged creators to fill the gaps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CK6vJg"&gt;But over the past year, more creators have started adding captions of their own. Compared to August — the month before community captions were deprecated — total user-submitted captions in January were up by more than 20 percent, a YouTube spokesperson told me. Year on year, from January 2020 to January 2021, the increase was by more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69y61G"&gt;“We’re delighted that creators are finding our captioning tools helpful for their videos,” the spokesperson said over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8irPC"&gt;Even though new tools such as a brand-new captions editor and the ability to add captions during the upload process were made available&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in July 2020 and May 2021, respectively, for some, the incentive to start captioning came from somewhere else: their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpz5O9"&gt;“I got a message on Twitter about how YouTube was planning on dropping an important [closed captions] feature a few months ago and that it could mean that there wouldn’t be any for my hard of hearing viewers,” said Kennie J.D., who creates videos on makeup and films for an audience of almost 570,000 people. “I found that horrible, so I’ve been paying for a service called Rev.com that makes captions for my videos after they go up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XHlRPQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PO2Ib"&gt;Poynter suggests that more awareness about the importance of captions is behind the 20 percent increase — that, and the idea that creators have “got no other choice now,” since they can’t rely on viewers to fill the gap. Whatever the reason, she isn’t the only one who benefits from the rise in subtitles. “[It’s] also people with ADHD, auditory processing disorder, or [those] learning whatever the spoken language the video is in. So many groups of people are missing out,” she says. “If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PV72t"&gt;Poor-quality captions don’t help things, either. YouTube does provide automatic captions through speech recognition, but many deaf users consider them inaccurate and unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yp1Get"&gt;So it falls to deaf activists and YouTubers like Poynter to call on others to write their own captions. “I used to send out personal emails to many YouTubers a year asking them to caption their content,” she says. “During VidCon and Playlist Live seasons for a few years, I even personally hand wrote letters and mailed it out to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L4vmO"&gt;YouTube added the ability to add captions in the “upload flow” earlier this month. In the past, the social media site failed to promote its captioning features well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqpfHJ"&gt;Poynter notes that the reported increase in manual captions is great, but they still need further promotion. For now, it seems, the community is doing YouTube’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWx0wX"&gt;“[Captioning is] something I hope all creators who make content full-time will start to do,” Edwards says. “While it’s really lovely to receive a little ‘thank you’ message as a token of someone’s appreciation, it’s also important to recognize the even more important work being done by deaf or hard of hearing creators on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7QV1"&gt;Commenting on YouTube’s recent promotion of captions in a tweet on Twitter, Poynter says: “They’re going to need to be more consistent about it. I do like that the uploading process now has a more accessible [way of adding captions]. When people actually see it, they’re a little more likely to want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will pay $100 million to creators using its TikTok competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-pUr9SuScH5h-38XwvEgDVgX2Q=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269159/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Shorts. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="do3O5E"&gt;YouTube plans to pay $100 million to creators who use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;, its TikTok competitor, throughout the next year. The goal is to encourage creators to pick up and continually post to its new service, which doesn’t otherwise give creators a built-in way to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buXQFo"&gt;Exactly how much creators can earn is still up in the air. YouTube says that it’ll reach out to creators on a monthly basis, looking for people with the most engagement and views. “Thousands” of creators could get paid each month, YouTube says, and basically anyone who posts to Shorts is eligible. The one caveat is that their videos have to be original content, and, of course, abide by YouTube’s community guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dObFNy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok has started paying creators, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8gpeUW"&gt;YouTube started launching Shorts in the US in March. The short videos appear in YouTube’s mobile app and, just like TikTok (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram Reels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;), you can swipe from one to the next in an endless full-screen feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAHzRj"&gt;Other companies have taken the same approach to encouraging creators to stick with their platform. TikTok launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;a $200 million creators fund&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, and Snapchat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;paid out $1 million per day&lt;/a&gt; for a period of time after its TikTok competitor, Spotlight, launched in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKxdAx"&gt;Payments will be available in the US and India — the two regions Shorts has launched — to start, but YouTube plans to expand its availability as it rolls out the service to more regions. There’s no specific date yet for when YouTube will start offering payments. YouTube says the fund will last from its start this year through some point in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has run the numbers to see how vloggers open their videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HjqD1R5jYjt_vZXO6oJ4NDaLwUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264132/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2b8UnS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;YouTube has run the numbers&lt;/a&gt; and discovered what greeting its vloggers most use to open videos: “Hey, guys.” Those findings may not be surprising if you’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the report actually shows a lot more, including what the runners-up are, how greetings have changed in popularity over time, and how video genre affects the most common openings. Let’s just jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRxQVj"&gt;To get these findings, YouTube did quite a bit of data analysis, looking at the auto- and creator-generated captions from over a million videos. YouTube picked videos that had over 20,000 views from channels that had over 20,000 subscribers, so it is worth noting that the results are more reflective of how relatively popular videos open, rather than of every single video on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTOOlBTlhg5z-ukWLhW8C8S7170=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504241/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.05.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The runners-up have changed over time, but “Hey, guys” has always been dominant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNiKuG"&gt;YouTube also breaks down how creators of different genres open their videos. For example, sports videos are way more likely to start with “What’s going on?” while travel videos start with a “Good morning” 9 percent of the time. “Hey, guys” comes in second for opening tech videos, with “Ladies and gentlemen” barely edging it out (though I do prefer &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i09V6SkVkz8?t=46"&gt;Tom Scott’s&lt;/a&gt; “Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErESGkQHEuG5rtKgeElr11hdpxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504243/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.34.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There sure are some outliers here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuBeG"&gt;The article also takes a look at international greetings from Brazilian, French, German, and Mexican creators. Surprisingly, only one has a phrase in the top spot that translates to “Hey, guys,” making it seem like more of an English-speaking opening than a global one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co16-ezXisx7CloZ_d9LidhJ_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504222/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.22.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Coucou tout le monde” is how I’m greeting everyone from now on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBHviN"&gt;To play around with the interactive timeline of greetings for yourself (and get a look at some famous channel openings from the infamous “Hey VSauce, Michael here” to “What’s up, Greg?”), you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;head over to YouTube’s article&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it’ll do a breakdown of how people end their videos next so I can get a good idea of how I should be ending these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google goes nuclear against Roku by adding YouTube TV to the main YouTube app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pb5quvxP-CvBjZR-tuSKdVLlwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253022/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ty3nbu"&gt;A week after their broken-down negotiations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;spilled into the public&lt;/a&gt;, Google and Roku still haven’t been able to reach a deal to renew YouTube TV’s presence on the huge streaming platform. But Google has come up with something of a workaround in the meantime: it’s going to let people access YouTube TV directly from the main YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdp0O4"&gt;YouTube users will start seeing a “Go to YouTube TV” option in the main YouTube app over the next few days. When they select that, they’ll then be switched over to the standard YouTube TV user experience. This option is coming to Roku devices first — where it’s currently most needed — but will also come to YouTube on other platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60xc5D8nnFQBEoj2MbMl-dfkvQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498898/Untitled_presentation__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV6Aw"&gt;In essence, Google has basically stuffed the YouTube TV app into YouTube itself, a solution that seems unlikely to make Roku very happy. Google says it’s “still working to come to an agreement with Roku to ensure continued access to YouTube TV for our mutual customers,” and it notes the YouTube TV app remains usable for those who already have it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5repmz"&gt;But in the event that things totally fall apart, Google says it’s “in discussions with other partners to secure free streaming devices in case YouTube TV members face any access issues on Roku.” A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this workaround is only for consumption of YouTube TV; customers cannot sign up for new subscriptions through the YouTube app at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ykhp1d"&gt;On Friday afternoon, Roku responded to Google’s latest move by calling the company “an unchecked monopolist.” Roku also criticized Google’s decision to bundle the services together as an example of its “predatory business practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csdrIx"&gt;Here’s Roku’s full statement, which suggests the company won’t be goaded into removing the main YouTube app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tZb47w"&gt;Google’s actions are the clear conduct of an unchecked monopolist bent on crushing fair competition and harming consumer choice. The bundling announcement by YouTube highlights the kind of predatory business practices used by Google that Congress, Attorney Generals and regulatory bodies around the world are investigating. Roku has not asked for one additional dollar in financial value from YouTubeTV. We have simply asked Google to stop their anticompetitive behavior of manipulating user search results to their unique financial benefit and to stop demanding access to sensitive data that no other partner on our platform receives today. In response, Google has continued its practice of blatantly leveraging its YouTube monopoly to force an independent company into an agreement that is both bad for consumers and bad for fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sIHVNm"&gt;Google said in its Friday blog post that it’s “in ongoing, long-term conversations with Roku to certify that new devices meet our technical requirements,” another confirmation that the company is insisting hardware makers implement support for AV1 decoding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YFfmZc"&gt;This certification process exists to ensure a consistent and high-quality YouTube experience across different devices, including Google’s own — so you know how to navigate the app and what to expect. We’ll continue our conversations with Roku on certification, in good faith, with the goal of advocating for our mutual customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4fqUlP"&gt;Roku has argued that Google’s requirements are unreasonable and will lead to higher prices for its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0gUJY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 7th, 3:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated to include comment from Roku.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The David After Dentist meme is now an NFT — and yes, this is real life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYllnBTe1b6vsmIGd4px1h2g1HE=/0x45:1331x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248508/david_dentist.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David After Dentist is now an NFT | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs&amp;amp;ab_channel=booba1234" target="_blank"&gt;David Devore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P5ZSWh"&gt;David DeVore was seven years old in 2008 when a trip to the dentist left him feeling “funny” afterward. His dad, David Sr., recorded his son’s post-anesthesia musings (“Is this real life?” “You have four eyes” “I feel funny”), and when he uploaded it to YouTube a few months later — intending to share it with friends and family — the video went viral within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqvHPR"&gt;Now, 140 million views and 11 years later, David After Dentist is becoming the latest mid-2000s meme to go up for auction as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CydfH4"&gt;“It kind of feels like 2009 all over again,” the elder DeVore said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “NFTs are like the wild west right now, it’s like back when we went viral and social media was in its infancy.” &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/davidafterdentist"&gt;The auction for the David NFT&lt;/a&gt; goes live today, and DeVore said he expects it will conclude sometime on Friday afternoon. (It’s officially open for 24 hours but could be extended for late bids.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zp4x00"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txqiwrbYGrs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SELTRh"&gt;DeVore says while his family dealt with their share of trolls — some who questioned his parenting — the meme has been a positive thing for their family, helping pay for his kids’ tuition. He didn’t get into the latest amounts, but he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-they-now-david-after-dentist-family-rolling-in-150000-2010-6"&gt;estimated in a 2010 interview&lt;/a&gt; that the family had made $150,000 in merchandise, licensing, and from YouTube revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wugDn"&gt;Compared to other creators of that era like Disaster Girl and Nyan Cat, he said he felt lucky he was able to retain some control of the meme. “They had less control, if any at all,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W3gRl"&gt;But those creators are seeing things come full circle now as well. Disaster Girl, whose real name is Zoe Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;went for $500,000&lt;/a&gt;, and Nyan Cat’s creator Chris Torres sold &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html"&gt;it for nearly $600,000&lt;/a&gt;. A ton of classic memes from back in the day have been auctioned as NFTs, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-luck-brian-meme-nft-crypto-art-blockchain-ethereum-foundation-2021-3"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/grumpycat/grumpy-cat-5467"&gt;Grumpy Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/keyboardcat/play-him-off-keyboard-cat-5553"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4sDdH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6iZwQe"&gt;David Jr. is 20 now and attending the University of Florida where he’s studying computer science (not dentistry, to this writer’s disappointment), and he has perfect teeth, his dad says. The response to the NFT has been mostly positive, DeVore Sr. added, in part because the creator economy has become more sophisticated since David After Dentist debuted more than a decade ago. “I think it plays into the strong empathy people have for creators,” he said. “People want to see them get rewarded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYRJHr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use YouTube’s gestures to make it bearable on a portrait-locked phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q307eboRfSUaBnFCcv-HVqoUQxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247427/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAzW1U"&gt;If you use your phone in portrait lock all the time, it can be frustrating trying to get YouTube videos into full screen with the tiny button in the UI. Thankfully, there’s a better way, using the app’s built-in gestures: you can simply swipe up on a video to fill up the screen and swipe down on it to go back to portrait orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT3nco"&gt;We’ve actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534349/youtube-mobile-app-gestures-swipe-full-screen-closed-caption-autoplay-buttons-update-new"&gt;written about this feature before&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it’s easy to miss; most of the people I’ve shown it to had no idea it existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDRctFnkzboC5cruqwsHWl-1woY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496515/DSCF2152_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VEAmmz"&gt;Of course, this feature works on Android phones as well, which I personally like better than having to hit the auto-rotate button built into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8vMAO"&gt;There is one obvious limitation: it only rotates one way. If you want to hold your phone with the left side facing up, you’re out of luck unless you turn portrait lock off. Still, it’s way better than having to tap on the video once to get the UI controls to show up, then trying to hit the tiny full-screen button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZws6q"&gt;Now all we need is this feature to be added to every other app (or for our phones to get smart enough to realize that if I’m watching a video and turn my phone, I probably want to see the video in full-screen, despite portrait lock). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 now has a YouTube TV app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25Ntq96TzeZMldyEVsk0uaDDiOo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246380/vpavic_4261_20201023_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxBn52"&gt;The PlayStation 5 &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129767#zippy=%2Cmobile-devices-computers%2Cstreaming-media-players-smart-tvs-game-consoles"&gt;now has a YouTube TV app&lt;/a&gt;, arriving more than six months after the console launched. That means anyone lucky enough to actually buy Sony’s latest console now has another way to watch live TV on it, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/05/youtube-tv-arrives-on-ps5-just-in-time-to-pick-up-ex-roku-viewers/"&gt;as first spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MSOBJ"&gt;YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;costs $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; (not counting additional extras) and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7286228?hl=en"&gt;allows up to three simultaneous streams&lt;/a&gt; within a household, which could be useful if your PS5 is hooked up in another room from your main TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5pLr1"&gt;Having another device that works with YouTube TV could be especially helpful for Roku owners, given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;ongoing feud between Google and Roku&lt;/a&gt; that has seen YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from Roku’s channel store&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Roku owners can’t install or re-download the app if they don’t already have it on their device.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOOF1t"&gt;Admittedly, the Venn diagram of “PS5 owners who subscribe to YouTube TV and also own a Roku device that didn’t already have the YouTube TV app” is certainly vanishing small. But in a world where corporate disputes can mean losing access to the services you pay for on the devices you already own at the drop of a hat, having more streaming options is never a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are the royals going to vlog?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4hjAa59jgcx2xVGIXoXxO3742Q=/227x0:2651x1616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243414/williamkatevlog.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0s0rf"&gt;The young attractive royal couple that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Harry and Meghan has dropped a truly chaotic intro video for their shiny new official YouTube channel. In the video, the presumed future queen and king of the United Kingdom (also known as Kate Middleton and Kate Middleton’s husband) laugh and chat awkwardly in what looks like their home. It’s well-lit but not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;well-lit: a reasonably good YouTuber rig but not exactly one of royal magnificence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apz9rO"&gt;“Be careful what you’re saying, these guys are going to start filming,” says Prince William to his smiling wife, as though she doesn’t know how cameras work. The general feel of the clip is the first few seconds after a camera starts rolling but before the YouTube stars start vlogging in earnest. Except they don’t vlog. The video then cuts to what can only be described as a hype reel of public appearances at public functions or at their various charities — not exactly an exclusive glimpse of the royals at home. Where is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Where are the chickens?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hiV7oo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is this new channel even for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YE3MjR"&gt;It’s not as though Will and Kate’s new channel is going to be a royal pioneer in the world of awkward webcam recordings with dubious production values. For one thing, it looks like they’ve invested in an actual setup. For another thing, the British royal family — as an official, monolithic institution — has had a YouTube channel since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/23/youtube.monarchy"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. And for the past year, while much of the world has been in lockdown, the channel has become replete with recordings of Zoom meetings. From such bangers as “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge host bingo” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_6tCpOllPw&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;100K views&lt;/a&gt;) to less inspired videos like “The Earl of Wessex joins a video call with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQaEOEz780&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;4.8K views&lt;/a&gt;), the House of Windsor has been very busy addressing the masses from their laptops, at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i1X4Z"&gt;So will the Cambridges vlog or won’t they? What is this new channel even for? And what’s the deal with their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/meghan-markle-instagram.html"&gt;weird Instagram follower count&lt;/a&gt;, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7biSAY"&gt;It’s impossible not to connect this latest foray into the world of #creator #platforms with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;bombshell interview&lt;/a&gt; with Oprah or to contrast it with that other couple’s deals with Netflix and Spotify. The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-fighting-drama-rumors.html"&gt;supposed bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between the princes and their wives might be more tabloid projection than reality, but it’s at least true that one couple is set to one day succeed to the throne, while the other has dealt the British monarchy a blow as severe as the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/princess-diana-martin-bashir-interview"&gt;1995 Princess Diana interview&lt;/a&gt; with Martin Bashir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SmL5t0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CYICv"&gt;Is the new Will and Kate YouTube channel a response to the burgeoning Harry / Meghan media empire? Is it a bid for independence from the British tabloid press? Or is it just the Kensington Palace comms team trying out something new that will wind up just as anodyne and dull as the rest of the royal family’s internet presence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfTNmw"&gt;In truth, it’s bizarre that the British royal family is just barely keeping up with the newest changes in the media landscape. A dysfunctional rich family whose sole purpose in life is to be famous? The Windsors were influencers before they were &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britains-king-george-v-changes-royal-surname"&gt;called the Windsors&lt;/a&gt; and long before being an influencer was even a thing. How is their entire brand still in the grip of the tabloids? It’s like the royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIJ7d"&gt;Of course, previous attempts at the “Royals: They’re Just Like Us” narrative have been met with mixed results. On the one hand, these behind-the-scenes-type video treatments have always done gangbusters in television ratings. On the other hand, the family has uniformly hated and despised these documentaries, like the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/uk/royal-family-1969-documentary-youtube-scli-gbr-intl/index.html"&gt;hilariously awkward 1969 BBC documentary&lt;/a&gt; depicting the everyday life of the royals, which is rumored to have been banned by the queen, though not until after approximately 350 million people viewed it worldwide. (The documentary made its way onto YouTube earlier this year and was quickly taken down via copyright notice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YlyY01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CiTCy"&gt;Then there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/prince-charles-in-tv-documentary-admits-to-infidelity.html"&gt;1994 ITV documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Prince Charles (you know, the one who married Diana) that was so disastrous for his image that a subsequent poll by &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; found that two-thirds of respondents did not want Charles to succeed as the next king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmTwk2"&gt;Will and Kate’s request for people to like and subscribe is the latest in a weighty media legacy spanning from Edward VIII’s abdication radio broadcast to Elizabeth II’s televised coronation to the tabloid warfare that Prince William’s own parents waged against each other before his mother’s untimely death while chased by paparazzi looking to feed the content mill. Given this history, it’s understandable why the couple’s online presence in all things is so tightly controlled. However, restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success, and the royal family’s reticence and general fear of candor is exactly one of the reasons why the Meghan / Harry and Oprah interview was such a wild success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RURbq1"&gt;But who’s to say how things will turn out after all? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are, essentially, taxpayer-funded celebrities. Surely, they’ve put more thought into this than we have. &lt;/p&gt;
