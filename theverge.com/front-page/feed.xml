    <title>ExamSoft’s proctoring software has a face-detection problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RvsrUa"&gt;Gabe Teninbaum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, is calling on ExamSoft to fix a serious bug with its test-taking software: failure to recognize faces. It’s a problem that can delay test takers — or bar them from starting their exams altogether — and per reports, it disproportionately impacts people with dark skin tones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SeHOw"&gt;ExamSoft’s software records students while they complete remote exams and monitors for signs of academic dishonesty. &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;Teninbaum’s report&lt;/a&gt; addresses an ExamSoft feature called ExamID, which aims to verify that test-takers are who they say they are. The first time a student logs into their exam portal, they upload a photo of themselves (their “baseline image”); they’re then prompted to take another selfie before beginning future exams, which the software checks against their original photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTCm5U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that facial-recognition algorithms consistently make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do white ones. And while those studies didn’t focus on ExamSoft specifically, it doesn’t appear to be an exception. Back in September, multiple non-white exam-takers told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the software couldn’t identify them due to “poor lighting” — a problem that Teninbaum, who has light skin, wasn’t able to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JbBN60"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExamSoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ExamSoft&lt;/a&gt; software can't "recognize" me due to "poor lighting" even though I'm sitting in a well lit room. Starting to think it has nothing to do with lighting. Pretty sure we all predicted their facial recognition software wouldn't work for people of color. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DiplomaPriv4All?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DiplomaPriv4All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alivardi Khan (@uhreeb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/uhreeb/status/1303139738065481728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cs8POb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExamSoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ExamSoft&lt;/a&gt;  I FINALLY figured out ON MY OWN 4 hours later ( still on hold for an EXAM SOFT chat rep) HOW TO GET TO MY MOCK EXAM... ONLY TO BE TOLD THE SYSTEM CANT RECOGNIZE ME. I AM IN A BOARD ROOM WITH ALL OF THE LIGHTS TURNED ON AND THE SUN WAS STILL UP. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7K3yKT1y4n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7K3yKT1y4n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Futureesq1990 (@futureesq1990) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/futureesq1990/status/1306393725099278336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjlQwj"&gt;Early this fall, Teninbaum set out to find a fix. He believes such errors add undue stress to an already stressful time period. “These are students who are about to take a high-stakes exam with a lot on the line, and that is very unwelcome,” Teninbaum said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4amm7Z"&gt;“Any time you go into an exam you just want to focus on the exam,” he added. “You don’t want to feel like you have these added challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYgJvT"&gt;Teninbaum also believes that optics matter; schools owe it to marginalized students not to rely on a category of software that’s known to be discriminatory. “Students deserve to feel that their institution is doing what it can to protect their rights, interests, and dignity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJonjk"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which is forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Law&lt;/em&gt;, Teninbaum outlines the workaround he found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V41vtS"&gt;He suggests that schools assign every student an identical generic, baseline image. Then, he proposes, they should ask ExamSoft to enable “deferred identification,” a feature built into the software that allows students to proceed with exams even if identification fails. This feature is basically hidden — it’s not mentioned anywhere on ExamSoft’s website (at least, not that I could find). Only ExamSoft can turn it on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkDTq4"&gt;In tandem, these tweaks will cause ExamSoft to misidentify every test-taker. But they’ll still be able to proceed with their exams — ExamSoft will send the selfies to the school afterwards, and instructors can manually verify everyone. “We know who our students are,” Teninbaum says. “We can make sure the students are who they say they are and avoid subjecting students to these sorts of challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upekb2"&gt;He also suggests that ExamSoft make the “deferred identification” feature accessible to customers. “The reporter urges ExamSoft to build this into a feature by which institutions can simply toggle on/off, thereby bypassing ExamID until such time that the technology matures into one that does not discriminate,” his report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63D7Sm"&gt;Teninbaum hopes those changes will last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and can help students feel more comfortable taking remote classes. “It’s going to be a growing problem as people get more and more online for their education,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKFrR3"&gt;Even so, he’s only fixed part of the problem. Students have experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/2020/09/23/cheating-frozen-computers-typing-lags-bar-examinees-raise-red-flags-over-looming-online-test/?slreturn=20210005190302"&gt;range of hiccups&lt;/a&gt; with ExamSoft’s proctoring software. &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/thousands-of-california-bar-exam-takers-have-video-files-flagged-for-review"&gt;Over 3,000&lt;/a&gt; people who used the platform to take California’s bar exam in October had their videos flagged for potential rule violations — nearly 36 percent of applicants who took the online exam. Users reported audio issues, and other technical glitches as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFGP0s"&gt;A group of six US senators — including Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Corey Booker — wrote an open letter to&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.12.3%20Letter%20to%20Ed%20Testing%20Software%20Companies%20ExamSoft.pdf"&gt; ExamSoft &lt;/a&gt;in December, highlighting potential harms to students of color and students with disabilities, among numerous other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXnhCA"&gt;ExamSoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v4GUL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxsk1X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned your Apple Watch can double as a vlogging viewfinder </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJ2R2SUUeFS4mE0jZx5JI8_l2w0=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68625472/20210105_mitchell_clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UgD7vJ"&gt;The Apple Watch’s ability to act as a camera remote for your phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced"&gt;got a mention in its announcement keynote&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s been around a while, but I’ve only ever used it once or twice to take group pictures. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta/status/1346526439068160002?s=20"&gt;Twitter user @PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt;, however, has pointed out that you can also use it as a vlogging aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6TueN"&gt;Doing this is simple: On your watch, go to the Camera Remote app. This will open the camera app on your iPhone, and you can switch it to video mode, set it up, and record. You don’t even have to strap your watch to your phone like he does in the tweet; the remote camera will totally work while your watch is on your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B1HhEr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the best self-recording hack ever and even works with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiLMiCPro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FiLMiCPro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt; for this tip.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/LGKS3S2pCh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LGKS3S2pCh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Roy   ☕️     (@pulpjedi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pulpjedi/status/1346523889736695808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C3hAgW"&gt;I’ve shot videos on my phone before, and it was often an exercise in frustration trying to get the framing right. There was a lot of running back and forth, recording short clips to make sure the focus and framing were correct. I could’ve definitely saved myself the hassle if I had remembered that my watch could do this, though I guess I would’ve gotten fewer steps in. It’s a sacrifice I’ll just have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1VTzHl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Using your Apple Watch as an iPhone viewfinder: surprisingly latency-free and useful &lt;a href="https://t.co/PyoxK6TxND"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyoxK6TxND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1346618135604908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3jPJX"&gt;Android users don’t need to feel left out either, as Wear OS devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18014640/google-pixel-wear-os-smartwatch-camera-viewfinder"&gt;can also act as a camera viewfinder&lt;/a&gt; when connected to Pixel phones. The Apple Watch trick will also work with the popular video camera app FiLMiC Pro, as Jeff mentions in his tweet. That way, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7925023/sundance-film-festival-2015-tangerine-iphone-5s"&gt;all the benefits the third-party app offers&lt;/a&gt;, plus the remote viewing on your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sAwSS"&gt;Of course, if you’re setting out to create a new vlogging setup, this is probably not the best way to go, especially if you don’t already have an Apple Watch. For less than the price of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/3/11/18259791/apple-watch-series-3-lte-best-buy-price-sale"&gt;Apple’s least expensive Watch (the Series 3)&lt;/a&gt;, you could instead get Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22216064%2Fiphone-vlogging-video-apple-watch-viewfinder#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to HDMI adapter&lt;/a&gt; (which would also let you power your phone so it doesn’t run out of battery), and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-1280x800-Mirrorless-Panasonic-Included/dp/B077FTPT46/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=camera+monitor&amp;amp;qid=1609895598&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;tag=duckduckgo-osx-b-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small camera monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Or, you could just position your phone in front of a mirror. But if you already have an Apple Watch, and want to film yourself using your iPhone, this tip may just make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump signs executive order blocking transactions with Alipay, WeChat Pay, and six other Chinese apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Holds Campaign Rally For GOP Senate Candidates Ahead Of Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5l3TkH9Umqc1QhVOSefuDryHwQ=/0x2:6155x4105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624952/1294541016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAhOLy"&gt;President Trump has signed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-applications-software-developed-controlled-chinese-companies/"&gt;a new executive order&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting transactions with the companies behind eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent’s QQ and WeChat Pay. Transactions will be prohibited in 45 days. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; was the first &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-exclusive/exclusive-trump-signs-order-banning-transactions-with-eight-chinese-apps-including-alipay-idINKBN29A2PA"&gt;to report the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJfG7p"&gt;The full list of apps includes: Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRh5Ed"&gt;“The pace and pervasiveness of the spread in the United States of certain connected mobile and desktop applications and other software developed or controlled by persons in the People’s Republic of China... continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-applications-software-developed-controlled-chinese-companies/"&gt;the order reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXmhn3"&gt;US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/01/statement-us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-president-trumps-executive"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the Commerce Department will  “begin implementing the E.O.’s directives, including identifying prohibited transactions.” &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that the Commerce Department will do so before Trump leaves office on January 20th, citing an unnamed official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHu6Vr"&gt;The new orders follow two earlier ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order"&gt;from August&lt;/a&gt; that already tried to ban transactions with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, and WeChat. However, a judge blocked the WeChat ban&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447540/judge-blocks-ban-wechat-tiktok-trump"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21531154/judge-denies-trump-administration-ban-wechat-tencent-china"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, while a judge granted a preliminary injunction stopping the TikTok ban &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrfiPL"&gt;If the US is successful in banning these apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358252/tencent-wechat-ban-trump-executive-order-consequences"&gt;it could be a pretty big deal&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/21496967/trump-wechat-us-ban-tik-tok"&gt;for Chinese American families&lt;/a&gt; who use these apps to communicate online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z85ixn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 7:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added quote from the order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read these stories about the use of spy satellite images in environmental studies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black and white satellite photo of an area in Russia, with text that says “18 August 1960 Imagery.” There are arrows pointing to areas that say “Parking Apron” and “Runway.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xR4BVoETmVx0OM6j4vh5fpuu5c=/0x254:755x757/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624712/corona_satellite_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo from the CIA’s Corona spy satellite program. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nro.gov/History-and-Studies/Center-for-the-Study-of-National-Reconnaissance/The-CORONA-Program/Imagery/" target="_blank"&gt;National Reconnaissance Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obfGyu"&gt;US spy satellites inadvertently collected vital environmental data at the height of the Cold War. This trove of photos and data from the Central Intelligence Agency has become crucial to the study of Earth’s environmental changes, as detailed in two fascinating stories in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; this week. One story details the life of a scientist who analyzed them for years, another follows the history of the spy satellites that provided them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BA8BB"&gt;Linda Zall, an environmental engineer, worked at the CIA for decades, leading a team that analyzed images from spy satellites to gather data for environmental studies. She wrote classified reports about how reconnaissance imagery could be used for earth and environmental science, running a &lt;a href="https://tos.org/oceanography/article/the-medea-program-opening-a-window-into-new-earth-science-data"&gt;research task force&lt;/a&gt; that she named Medea, and traveling to Moscow to negotiate the sharing of Arctic data between Russia and the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WCNuV"&gt;Though the secrecy of the CIA prevented her from being able to publicly take credit for her work, it paved the way for modern scientists to continue using the same methods to study environmental shifts. Declassified images from the Corona satellite project — which collected nearly 2 million images from orbit from 1960 to 1972 — are now used by scientists to track decades of changes around the world, from the movement of glaciers to the erosion of shorelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txwkqw"&gt;Satellites operated by the CIA have provided vast amounts of environmental data from the 1960s onward that otherwise wouldn’t exist. Other satellite documentation of the Earth’s surface wasn’t collected until later in the century, and being able to look further into the past allows scientists to more accurately predict future changes. Not all of those images are easily accessible though; the majority of Corona’s film has yet to be scanned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYIvJl"&gt;To read the full stories, both of which include comparisons of satellite imagery throughout the years, find the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/science/linda-zall-cia.html"&gt;article on Zall here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/science/corona-satellites-environment.html"&gt;history of the Corona satellites here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Anker’s MagSafe-style charger has a gigantic USB-C plug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0-jrA5RiTLAxqlZDt3nWpPF0Bk=/0x0:1850x1233/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624545/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_3.29.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rgoFru"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging system&lt;/a&gt; offers a whole new way to charge iPhones, and third-party companies like Anker are jumping at the chance to make their own magnetic chargers — both official ones that work with Apple’s system and unofficial ones that just take advantage of the magnetic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw8u4s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Anker-PowerWave/dp/B08LPPD3NL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s $22 charger&lt;/a&gt; falls into the second category: it’s not an official MagSafe charger, meaning it doesn’t offer the faster 15W charging speed or the fancy NFC tricks as “official” MagSafe products. But even with that 7.5W charging limit, Anker’s charger does &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; a lot like Apple’s, at least at first glance. Look closer at the other end of the plug, though, and there’s an obvious difference: the Anker model has a weirdly oversized USB-C plug. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoVsUSjuo3UYaRxwdk8v9zGejxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216019/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.48.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oNTW43"&gt;That’s because the Anker charger is effectively just a regular Qi charger in a different shape, one that moves the wiring and chips to the plug in order to slim down on the actual charging pad. The design also helps reduce heat, according to the company. It may look strange, but if you think of it less as a charging cable and more as a miniaturized Qi charger, it’s actually quite impressive to see what Anker has pulled off here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5irF4i"&gt;The new charger is also just the first effort from Anker. The company says that stock will be limited, but it’s already working on upgraded magnetic charger models that should be out in about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALND1T"&gt;On the one hand, the Anker charger is a clear indication of the limits of Apple’s MagSafe program. Third-party companies that aren’t able to create official products have to find creative workarounds, like Anker’s gigantic plug. On the other hand, Anker’s charger is a first-generation product, so these alternatives will likely get better over time. And at $22 — roughly half of what Apple charges for an official MagSafe charger, the slower charging speed might a worthwhile trade-off for the lower price, especially as the designs continue to get more and more refined. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok teens’ latest passion is enterprise software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFfE_DGak6JDebxmTG0x9AciP0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624414/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vAO7oT"&gt;Five days into the new year, and TikTok’s hottest 2021 trend is teens using enterprise software to go viral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13JU9I"&gt;As if the coronavirus pandemic hadn’t already blurred the lines between work and home enough, students and teens are going viral on TikTok after making Notion boards that mimic teen Tumblr feeds. Some users filled their Notion headers with vibey coffeehouse photos or pictures of anime or other characters that inspire them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BacE2T"&gt;Navigating around Notion’s website, many people wouldn’t expect to see a bunch of teenagers using the software as replacements for their school planners. The site features tweets from folks like XOXO Festival organizer Andy Baio and other Silicon Valley pseudo-celebrities touting how they use the trendy app to keep their tech teams organized as marketing. It’s pretty clear who the app’s main audience is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOjGEY"&gt;But this week, Notion absolutely blew up on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RhkxrQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@cu.rtas/video/6913287348545408262" data-video-id="6913287348545408262" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@cu.rtas" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cu.rtas"&gt;@cu.rtas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;i like to think i have it together &lt;a title="university" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/university"&gt;#university&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="notion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/notion"&gt;#notion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="study" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/study"&gt;#study&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ الصوت الأصلي - Mariam " href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%8A-6897232455787367170"&gt;♬ الصوت الأصلي - Mariam &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq6k5Y"&gt;In one video, the account @cur.tas gained over 1.1 million views in less than two days, showing off their Notion setup. They imported GIFs and images of anime characters and the Lofi Study Beats girl into their templates, mirroring popular studyblr and studytok aesthetics that have grown popular on platforms like Tumblr and TikTok over the last few years. Think Donna Tartt’s &lt;em&gt;The Secret History &lt;/em&gt;meets productivity tips — that’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/9/15260026/tumblr-study-blogging-studyblr-organization-interview"&gt;studyblr&lt;/a&gt; aesthetic in 2021. Scrolling through the video’s comments, dozens of users were begging the account to make a tutorial explaining how they set up their Notion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suhlcD"&gt;Other users, like @promeat, duetted the video &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJW2MXJo/"&gt;setting up their own Notion accounts&lt;/a&gt;. After posting their original video learning how to use the app, @promeat made another video showing people their “daily Notion routine,” explaining what they do when they log in to the app every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecjWAI"&gt;When asked about the growing popularity of the app, a Notion spokesperson said, “We’re amazed watching it!” but didn’t comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFHDFN"&gt;As someone who used to spend a lot of time as a high schooler scrolling through the studyblr hashtag on Tumblr, I get the appeal of Notion to young people. Like Tumblr, Notion is a blank slate, providing users with plenty of different templates to build and customize into what best suits their needs (and aesthetics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ON0vs"&gt;Outside of customization, the coronavirus pandemic could play a significant part in why Notion has taken off with the youth. I’m sure hardly any of these teens are walking into physical classrooms anymore. I imagine it’s hard to keep your life and schoolwork in order when your only classroom is your dining room table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyRB7N"&gt;Enterprise software has been working its way into personal life and relationships for some years now. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how parents were beginning to use enterprise software and apps like Asana and Trello to assign their children chores. Maybe as more and more of our work lives merge together with our personal ones, enterprise software like Notion might get a little more fun.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnxIT2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is prepping an AirTags competitor that could let you find lost items through walls </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiKv0inrEMuZf4yW2bN_S0EkBbY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624292/TilePro_inBlackandWhite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LBWOwm"&gt;Tile is working on a new tracker that relies on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, which would put the company in direct competition with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/"&gt;yet-to-be-announced AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new tracker would go a step further than the company’s Bluetooth devices by allowing you to know more precisely where a lost item is in relationship to yourself, without having to listen for a chime the tracker plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Xhx1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; haven’t been officially announced, but there’s already a list of potential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;features they might have&lt;/a&gt;, like the ability to remind you if you’ve left an item behind or help you find lost items using augmented reality. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expects-uwb-to-be-one-of-the-next-big-wireless-technologies"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; has also expressed interest in offering similar features, so Tile could be sharing space with two larger companies. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;demoed UWB with its U1 chip&lt;/a&gt; in the iPhone 11, which let you direct AirDropped files by pointing your phone, but the tracking applications are even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GnbHZTDkVC5NwtTRVOy5ENIpI4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215654/Screen_Shot_2021_01_04_at_3.03.02_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile / TechCrunch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s rumored UWB tracker shares a similar design to Tile’s bluetooth offerings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BNV9ml"&gt;Ultra-wideband (not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295600/verizon-5g-network-first-tests-data-speed"&gt;Ultra Wideband 5G from Verizon&lt;/a&gt;) operates sort of like Bluetooth Low Energy. It sends out low-energy, short-range pulses at a high frequency that transmit wireless data. With Bluetooth and your phone’s GPS, Tile can show the general location of something on a map, but for anything more precise, it relies on sound to help you find things. A UWB device could work if you’re multiple rooms away, showing you the more precise location of something through walls or floors, while also offering the features Tile currently has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF8x0d"&gt;Imagine finding a lost valuable when it’s out of earshot or locked inside a container. Tile’s app (or &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/20/find-my-items-tab-apple-tag-screenshots/"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/a&gt;) could point you in the right direction with your phone, using augmented reality images superimposed on your camera feed. It actually seems useful and less annoying than a loud chirp from Tile’s trackers (something I almost always accidentally set off).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kNz3eaUPqAA9onfpvDUaULx8qU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215784/Screen_Shot_2021_01_04_at_3.02.00_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile / TechCrunch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The augmented reality tracking experience Tile could add to its app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hT00M2"&gt;What’s more exciting is you may already own a device that supports these features. Since the iPhone 11, Apple has been integrating UWB into its popular smartphone with the U1 chip. It’s also started placing the chip in the Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;starting with the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra already features UWB, and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra is confirmed to feature it as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im95Jr"&gt;Not every device either company sells has it on board (Apple devices like &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/apples-new-iphone-se-doesnt-have-a-u1-ultra-wideband-chip"&gt;the iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Watch SE, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/07/2020-ipad-pro-no-u1-chip-confirmed/"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; don’t have UWB), but since Apple and Samsung are two of the largest electronic device makers in the world, adoption of UWB could be quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EV1guB"&gt;There’s no set date for Tile’s launch of its UWB tracker, but UWB seems like it could be a big deal, especially now that Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework"&gt;opened up access to the U1 chip in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;. Tile and Apple have disagreed in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;over default location sharing settings&lt;/a&gt; that disadvantage Tile, but at least both companies seem to agree on the potential of UWB in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub says it will now operate in Iran after receiving sanction exemption</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQ9BzTVlamUJKImv0vsmSLhJfvs=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623987/1211647318.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O4CYlp"&gt;GitHub says it will now offer its full range of services in Iran, after imposing restrictions on the platform for Iranian developers due to US sanctions. The changes are due to an exemption granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the sanction enforcement arm of the US Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiDneC"&gt;“Today we are announcing a breakthrough: we have secured a license from the US government to offer GitHub to developers in Iran. This includes all services for individuals and organizations, private and public, free and paid,” GitHub CEO Nat Friedman wrote in a &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/"&gt;blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the course of two years, we were able to demonstrate how developer use of GitHub advances human progress, international communication, and the enduring US foreign policy of promoting free speech and the free flow of information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmqPyu"&gt;GitHub has been operating in a very limited form in Iran &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, mostly by making &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-12-global-software-collaboration-in-the-face-of-sanctions/"&gt;some public code repositories available&lt;/a&gt;, due to US trade restrictions that forced the Microsoft-owned open-source hosting site to similarly restrict its operations in Crimea and Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzQqPf"&gt;The company is now “in the process of rolling back all restrictions on developers in Iran” and “reinstating full access to affected accounts,” and Friedman says GitHub is working on receiving exemptions for Crimea and Syria, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is pausing its 3G shutdown indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yc-MECnplWZx7mqEH4gntj_KZC8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623912/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQDhUA"&gt;Verizon is indefinitely delaying the shutdown of its 3G network, pushing back the original plan for the network to shutter at the end of 2020 to an as-yet-undetermined point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VjPhE"&gt;The news comes from Verizon spokesperson Kevin King, who &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/verizon-indefinitely-delays-3g-network-shutdown/d/d-id/766399?_mc=RSS_LR_EDT"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Our 3G network is operational and we don’t have a plan to shut it down at this time. We’ll work with customers to move them to newer technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qLqyX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;, Verizon previously announced that it planned to shutter the 3G network at the end of 2020, which was already a delay. (The company originally intended to close the network at the end of 2019.) Now, it seems that Verizon is once again punting that decision down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKZsQA"&gt;The interesting part of this decision is that Verizon is making it solely for customers who are still using their existing 3G devices. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fknowledge-base-218813%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22215453%2Fverizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no longer allows&lt;/a&gt; customers to activate new 3G phones on its network (as of 2018), nor does it offer prepaid 3G service (as of 2019). Obviously, Verizon would prefer that its customers upgrade to new 4G LTE — or, at this point, 5G — plans (presumably with new phones that they’ll buy through the carrier). But the repeated delays in shutting down the 3G network seem to suggest that the transition isn’t going as fast as the company would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OhRse"&gt;Verizon isn’t the only network working to move customers off of its legacy 3G network. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;recently advised&lt;/a&gt; its customers using 3G phones that it plans to shut down its 3G network sometime in early 2022, while T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;reportedly looking&lt;/a&gt; to make voice over LTE (VoLTE) a requirement early this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patents point to using your MacBook to wirelessly charge your iPhone and Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euw_dZeUrJ1Mf86nWNmC3Rx8HtQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623907/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wxBfg"&gt;Apple has been granted two patents that describe adding two-way wireless charging to its devices (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/macbook-wirelessly-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The patents, first &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/01/apple-has-been-granted-a-pair-of-2-way-charging-patents-for-a-future-macbook-pro-that-could-recharge-idevices-and-more.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Patently Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include drawings that show a MacBook charging various devices, including an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as drawings of iPads and iPhones doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzIN8M"&gt;If this sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21353196/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-price-release-date-camera-stylus-specs"&gt;many other phone makers&lt;/a&gt; have released devices with similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;reverse wireless charging technology&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple’s take is a little different. According to the patent images, a MacBook’s lid, palm rest, or trackpad could be used to charge a wireless charging-compatible iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3fZqL9Bx3Qcb2pcKVmaX8Zpjw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215615/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.24.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patent shows a future MacBook device charging an iPhone and Apple Watch, though this configuration would make it tricky to use the computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiKgL"&gt;The problem the patents claim to solve is the one where you may find yourself without enough outlets, power bricks, or any electricity at all. The patents state that “despite having standardized connectors and cable[s], each device may require a separate or dedicated power supply to charge. In some cases, having separate power supplies for each device may be burdensome to use, store, and/or transport.” (Of course, having separate power bricks for your devices is also made more difficult &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455726/apple-removes-charging-brick-watch-edition-hermes-model-environment"&gt;when they aren’t included in the box&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3oI461NOFoIxv3TBWA_gwrOc9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215618/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This figure showing devices being charged on a MacBook’s lid suggests that you could use your laptop as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkWgSd"&gt;There are other times when this kind of tech could be useful. For example, if you’re away from a charger and your Apple Watch or AirPods die, it’d be useful to be able to top them up with your phone. Likewise, being able to charge your phone from your laptop would be useful, and if Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;truly heading toward a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, this type of tech could be a way to retain that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrY6TH"&gt;Right now, MacBooks and iPads are made out of aluminum, which isn’t compatible with wireless charging. If Apple wants to include this reverse wireless charging tech in its devices, it’ll have to design around that limitation. (Maybe it could bring back a plastic MacBook?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqvby"&gt;It’s also hard to avoid thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower project&lt;/a&gt; when considering the idea of a MacBook or iPad filled with wireless charging coils that are able to charge multiple devices at once. To be fair, Apple’s tech has progressed since then, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;now has control of the processors in all of its devices&lt;/a&gt;. It may come up with some solution to help the devices communicate and power levels and thermal constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ1rVy"&gt;Whether you’ll actually be able to use your MacBook as a wireless charging pad for all of your devices remains to be seen, but I’d at least like to see this tech come to the iPhone. Many of its competitors already have some sort of reverse wireless charging capability, and while it’d be great to see it cranked up to 11 like in the below patent drawing, I’d be happy with Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;catching up with the competition at this point&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;it seems like the iPhone 12 has the hardware to do this&lt;/a&gt;, it’s currently not enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
