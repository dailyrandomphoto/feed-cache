    <title>Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppIiJC"&gt;While vocal app developers accused Apple last week of spinning a lawsuit settlement into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;an App Store change that was barely a change at all&lt;/a&gt;, the company appears to be making a true, if small concession today: Apple says it will let developers of “reader” apps (think Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon’s Kindle app) directly link their customers to their own sign-up website, where they could potentially skirt Apple’s in-app payment system (and its 30 percent cut) entirely, in those cases where they haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLwik"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple claims that the move will close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and that it’ll only apply to those sorts of “reader” apps right now — a category that was originally designed by Apple to placate companies like Netflix and Hulu by allowing them to let users simply sign into their existing account instead of signing up for a new subscription via the App Store (and having to pay Apple’s fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBg1OS"&gt;The JFTC has confirmed the agreement &lt;a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; of its own, saying that the move by Apple “would eliminate the suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act.” The commission, which has been investigating Apple since 2016, says the company has pledged to report on the status of app review transparency once a year for the next three years. According to the JFTC, Apple proposed changing its app review guidelines in response to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Rk61c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AywYGE"&gt;Currently, the Netflix and Spotify apps on iOS are useless if you don’t already have a subscription: both of them only offer a sign-in page, with no link out to their website, and a cheeky apology. “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle,” reads the Netflix app’s splash page. The Amazon Kindle app, by contrast, offers a basic “Create a new Amazon account” page inside the app itself, but doesn’t let you buy books there, or even in the standard Amazon app. You have to go to a mobile browser to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGLefKU-OG9ML3YGcbPRlxYRXbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821705/netflix_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that greets you when opening the Netflix app on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sB9svf"&gt;The rule change has an extremely limited scope, as Apple claims it only agreed to let developers of so-called reader apps to “share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account.” Apple also says it will “help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases,” which suggests it will have specific guidelines for how these links appear. It’s not clear whether developers will be able to mention pricing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEdgJj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There are just as many questions as answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Does Apple still get to define “reader” app by fiat?&lt;br&gt;- Can apps explicitly mention payment or price or is that muzzled?&lt;br&gt;- One link - where does it go? Are there rules?&lt;a href="https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW"&gt;https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1433236886953279489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgu1dG"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation"&gt;when Apple rejected the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;, and even after it later modified that controversial decision, the company was very clear that email apps do not count as “reader” apps, even if you similarly subscribe outside of the app and the only thing you can do without an account is sign in. Apple is the one that decides which apps qualify as reader apps to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8wZY"&gt;It also seems like Apple may be slightly redefining what a “reader” app means: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps"&gt;While the company’s App Review Guidelines suggest&lt;/a&gt; that a reader app “may” allow users to access previously purchased content (presumably alongside in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;like Netflix offered for years&lt;/a&gt;), Apple’s new press release specifies that “developers of reader apps &lt;strong&gt;do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(bolding ours). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ6Kh2"&gt;That would mean that Apple’s only offering this exception to companies that aren’t contributing any in-app purchase commissions to Apple anyways. Which, admittedly, include some of Apple’s sternest critics like Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfifXJ"&gt;Some critics of Apple’s anti-steering rules have suggested they could charge users less if they could direct them to their own website instead of Apple’s IAP, since they wouldn’t have to pay Apple that extra 30 percent and could thus pass along the savings. But if Apple’s “reader” category doesn’t wind up including apps that offer IAP, that idea probably won’t be possible under Apple’s new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qre5ui"&gt;It may be a while before we find out the answers to these questions: Apple says the rule won’t go into effect until early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the Tesla Roadster ‘should ship’ in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSnKZTAAr4JOvdUIrgKhnmhVFio=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806228/Roadster_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tesla Roadster.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkqzEZ"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the upcoming Tesla Roadster “should ship in 2023” in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065"&gt;a tweet on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. He blamed the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;supply chain shortages&lt;/a&gt; for the long timeline. “2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXNSeX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming 2022 is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ls759J"&gt;Elon Musk first announced the $200,000 second-generation Roadster at a splashy event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669024/tesla-roadster-2017-fastest-car-world"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, promising that the base model could go from 0 to 60 in a staggering 1.9 seconds. He also said that the Roadster would have a 200kWh battery pack and a 620-mile range per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQOFD"&gt;At the time, production was scheduled to start sometime in 2020, but in January, Musk said that production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255902/tesla-roadster-production-2022-elon-musk-ceo-tweet"&gt;would instead begin in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The delays might sting for people who have already put down deposits on the car — Tesla is taking $50,000 deposits for the base model and $250,000 deposits for the higher-end Founders Series model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIkhsS"&gt;Tesla has already adjusted to the global chip shortage by substituting alternative chips into its cars and rewriting its software to support it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Musk said in an earnings call in July&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that are still some hurdles to clear until it can release the promising new Roadster. And it’s not just the Roadster that’s a ways out; production on the Tesla Cybertruck has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA investigating off-course descent of Virgin Galactic’s flight with Richard Branson</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAHVOz"&gt;Richard Branson’s July flight to the edge of space is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration for veering out of its designated airspace mid-flight, the FAA said on Wednesday after a &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The mission’s two pilots were alerted to yellow and red light warnings mid-flight that, according to sources in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, should’ve prompted them to abort the mission. The flight continued and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;ultimately landed safely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCfgga"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane air-launched from its carrier aircraft on July 11th carrying founder Branson and three company employees over the firm’s New Mexico spaceport, Spaceport America. The rocket plane soared 53.5 miles high, skimming the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness before free-gliding back to a runway, using the rocket-propelled momentum from its ascent. Branson and the company lauded the mission as a success shortly after, with the company’s president Mike Moses telling reporters “the ship looked perfect” at touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vsu1ya"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A red light that “should scare the crap out of you” lit up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUTr0t"&gt;But as the space plane was accelerating toward peak altitude, the two pilots, Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, saw cockpit warnings that indicated the ship wasn’t flying as steeply as it should have been. Such warnings “should scare the crap out of you,” Masucci was quoted by &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;as saying in a 2015 meeting with other company pilots. That gave the pilots two options, per company procedures: “implement immediate corrective action, or abort the rocket motor,” the magazine reports. Triggering an abort and returning Branson and his crew to ground without reaching space would’ve been the safest option at the time, multiple sources told Nicholas Schmidle, the article’s author who also published an exhaustive book on Virgin Galactic’s history earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PsqbO"&gt;The July flight fulfilled Branson’s long-held goal to travel to space. Branson, originally slated to fly on a later mission, moved up his flight soon after Jeff Bezos announced he’d fly on his space company Blue Origin’s rocket in July. Virgin Galactic has said safety is its top priority and Branson has denied that Bezos’ rival jaunt to space played a role in his decision to launch sooner than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvvQ53"&gt;In a statement, a Virgin Galactic spokesperson said the crew was never in any danger, the “change in trajectory” was caused by high-level winds and that the company disputes what it considers “misleading characterizations and conclusions” in the New Yorker story. “Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they have been trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures,” the spokesperson said. “Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1fIBNJRa2XZr4e-NsgyRj3wj64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821391/1233924544.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Branson, 71, speaks to reporters in July shortly after flying to space&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5htxI"&gt;“During its July 11, 2021 flight, the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo vehicle deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America,” a spokesperson for the FAA said in a statement. “The FAA investigation is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wauC5"&gt;The off-course descent isn’t Virgin Galactic’s first brush with danger. In 2014, the company suffered a mid-flight disaster during a test flight that killed one pilot and severely injured another. After that, Branson vowed to fly aboard the ship himself before flying paying customers, as a show of confidence in the vehicle’s safety. In another test flight in 2018, with Mackay and Masucci as pilots, SpaceShipTwo veered out of control, spinning and tumbling mid-air before the pilots regained stability and landed safely, Schmidle reports. The cause was later found to be a manufacturing defect that took months to fix. After the plane flew again in 2019, engineers found significant damage to a crucial part of the plane, with a glue-like material ripped up and exposing a large gap, Schmidle wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSnEZf"&gt;Schmidle’s &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; story also revealed that Virgin Galactic’s former lead test pilot and flight test director, Mark Stucky, was fired eight days after Branson’s flight in the wake of revelations from Schmidle’s book. Stucky &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/virgin-galactic-flight-test-director-mark-stucky-leaves-company.html"&gt;previously wrote on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; that he didn’t leave on his own terms, but the reason for his departure had been unclear. That marked the second departure of a senior safety-related employee for the company — Todd Ericson, a retired Air Force Colonel and Virgin Galactic’s former VP of safety and test, resigned from the company shortly after the 2019 test flight, frustrated with the Virgin Galactic’s safety culture, according to Schmidle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gMIxL"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s next crewed mission, which will also be its first revenue-generating flight, is slated for late September carrying three members of the Italian Air Force. FAA investigations into unexpected flight events usually keep future missions from taking place until the agency’s inquiry is complete and any potential corrections are made by the company. But the FAA’s probe into the Unity 22 mission “has no impact on future test flights,” the Virgin Galactic spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmVqiB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 1st, 8:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds a statement from a Virgin Galactic spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The time a human-driven car ran over an autonomous robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Starship Technologies delivery robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW6O8vtEHrjM3G9jTGWi-MXm_ek=/96x0:1905x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805900/starship_delivery_bot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Starship Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5cUJcr"&gt;Crossing city streets filled with SUV drivers in a hurry is tricky for any pedestrian, but what about a robot that’s less than two feet tall? &lt;a href="https://www.starship.xyz/"&gt;Starship Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is flooding college towns with autonomous electric delivery bots that trundle goods to your location in their locked storage compartment. While the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973971/uber-self-driving-car-crash-investigation-human-error-results"&gt; safety of human pedestrians around large vehicles with autonomous capabilities&lt;/a&gt; is still being debated, this time, the roles were reversed. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa/video/7002765870946651398"&gt;As shown in a video posted to TikTok by rach,ipsa&lt;/a&gt;, even a couple of lights plus cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and neural networks weren’t enough for this robot to avoid getting clipped by a Ford Escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="abuN7P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Thousands of autonomous delivery robots are about to descend on US college campuses ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="bj6hBn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa/video/7002765870946651398" data-video-id="7002765870946651398" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@rach.ipsa" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa"&gt;@rach.ipsa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @cody_offic it's about as wonderful as you imagined   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - rach.ipsa" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7002765681733241606"&gt;♬ original sound - rach.ipsa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXYAQm"&gt;In the robot’s defense, it appears to have had the right of way. This video was captured &lt;a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/campus-news/uk-partners-starship-bring-robot-food-delivery-campus"&gt;at the University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617175/starship-technologies-delivery-robots-college-campuses"&gt;one of the four schools Starship Technologies said it’s expanding to this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Combine unfamiliar robots with students and faculty who have probably been away from campus for more than a year, and it feels inevitable that there would be a dust-up eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOrzgH"&gt;While the delivery bot could retreat onto the sidewalk despite a busted wheel or two, it’s unclear if the vehicle it collided with took any damage. Insurance companies aren’t always the easiest to deal with, and it’s hard to imagine they’re prepared to respond when someone runs into a robot. Last September, a Frisco, TX woman said a Starship robot hit her car at a stoplight, doing $2,600 in damage. As &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/nbc-5-responds/nbc-5-responds-what-happens-if-youre-in-a-crash-with-a-robot/2442345/"&gt;reported by&lt;em&gt; NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she learned Starship had video of the incident, but she couldn’t obtain a copy or get additional responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvQByG"&gt;Her insurance company initially insisted she was responsible for paying the deductible; however, after the media outlet contacted Starship Technologies, the robot operators reportedly paid for the repairs.  Starship Technologies did not respond to requests for comment about the incident or the status of the robot. Still, for our robot friend, things could’ve been worse — at Purdue University, &lt;a href="https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_50e991d0-db68-11eb-8ad5-cb5ef0447653.html"&gt;one of them got smushed by a garbage truck coming out of an alley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s aptX Lossless promises CD-quality audio for wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dk29DEtxQYdRiLuQXBli0-Hdbo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805804/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbMPQK"&gt;2021 has been a big year for lossless music now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple has gone in on the higher-quality streaming&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;no longer charging an added premium&lt;/a&gt; for it. But one of the main challenges confronting lossless audio is how to play it wirelessly (at full fidelity) on wireless headphones and earbuds. Qualcomm thinks it has found a solution with the new aptX Lossless, which is part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313214/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-announced-high-res-audio"&gt;Snapdragon Sound program&lt;/a&gt; announced earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pBU86"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/09/01/qualcomm-adds-bluetooth-lossless-audio-technology-snapdragon-sound"&gt;With aptX Lossless&lt;/a&gt; (which is technically an extension of aptX Adaptive), Qualcomm says it’ll be able to stream CD-quality, 16-bit / 44.1kHz lossless audio over Bluetooth. The first devices to feature the new technology are expected to be available in early 2022. Snapdragon Sound leans on the whole hardware chain for optimal performance — so both your Android mobile phone and your earbuds or headphones will need to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrFKKt"&gt;But if they do, Qualcomm says Snapdragon Sound will automatically detect a lossless audio source and be able to play it at much higher data rates than previously possible with aptX HD. The company has managed to outdo Sony’s LDAC in terms of bandwidth: aptX Lossless can hit up to 1Mbps compared to LDAC’s ceiling of 990kbps. There’s still some compression being applied; CD-quality music typically has a sample bit rate of 1.4Mbps. But Qualcomm is using lossless compression to deliver mathematically bit-for-bit exact audio reproduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlEzQz"&gt;In environments with a lot of wireless congestion, the bit rate will dynamically scale down as low as 140kbps to maintain the best audio performance based on connection quality. LDAC can struggle in real-world scenarios when you’re pushing it to its bit rate limits, so it’s not surprising to see Qualcomm offer a solution to smoothen out the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbpBpE"&gt;CD quality is where aptX Lossless tops out. You can still &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; hi-resolution audio tracks, but that’ll result in lossy streaming, so you’ll want to keep a wired solution around if you’re big on those 24-bit 96kHz files. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Broadcasters secure a win in their fight against scrappy TV streamer Locast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3k_FyTp-QAQYE0N0y9z8TCojkw4=/0x10:2164x1453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805756/locast.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6rHoaV"&gt;ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox have secured a victory in their legal fight against Locast, a nonprofit that re-streams their local broadcast stations at little to no cost, much to the consternation of those networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoqByd"&gt;Locast is a service that makes local broadcasts free — kind of, we’ll get to that — to those who may be unwilling to pony up for cable or live TV streaming services, or just don’t want to hook up an antenna in their living room. Those four networks are already broadcast over-the-air for free; Locast then uses a &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/111"&gt;legal exemption&lt;/a&gt; in copyright law to re-transmit their broadcasts and put them online for people to more easily access. Locast doesn’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; charge for its service, but it does &lt;a href="https://www.locast.org/donate"&gt;ask for donations&lt;/a&gt; that start around $5 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6W0q0"&gt;Essentially, users can use Locast to bypass traditional means of accessing broadcast networks on the super cheap. This hasn’t gone over well with the big four broadcasters, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748677/locast-streaming-tv-lawsuit-abc-cbs-fox-nbc"&gt;claimed in a 2019 complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Locast’s business was “an acknowledged effort to devalue the entire market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4leTbm"&gt;This week, a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21052725-locast"&gt;court ruled&lt;/a&gt; in the broadcasters’ favor by agreeing with their arguments that because Locast frequently prompted users to donate through interruptions to their programming, and that those costs exceeded “the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service,” it was not operating within the boundaries of the exemption. The ruling was made on the grounds that collected funds were being used for expansion, rather than maintaining operation alone. The Hollywood Reporter &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/broadcasters-score-big-legal-win-against-locast-a-popular-app-streaming-network-tv-1235006305/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xGW0h"&gt;While the case isn’t over, the ruling could potentially imperil Locast’s ability to operate as it currently does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUHhW6"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which joined Locast’s legal defense team last year, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/09/court-ruling-against-locast-gets-law-wrong-lets-giant-broadcast-networks-control"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the court’s decision “reads the law in an absurdly narrow way,” adding that the copyright’s retransmission exception for nonprofits was written to make local broadcast stations widely accessible. The foundation further said that the ruling threatened access to local news and information for millions of Locast users during a time of “unprecedented” natural catastrophes and amid an ongoing pandemic. It added that it’s evaluating next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qocYoE"&gt;“Make no mistake, this case demonstrates once again how giant entertainment companies use copyright to control when, where, and how people can receive their local TV broadcasts, and drive people to buy expensive pay-TV services to get their local news and sports,” the foundation said. “We are disappointed that the court is enabling this callous profiteering that tramples on Congress’s intent to ensure local communities have access to news that’s important to people regardless of their ability to pay. The court made a mistake, and Locast is considering its options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3j5Qp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 1st, 6:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Wednesday evening, Locast notified its customers via email that it would immediately begin suspending all requests for donations that interrupted programming. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw3dDf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This means that anyone located in a market we serve who signs up for Locast will get the service without interruption, regardless of whether or not they donate,” the company said. “Of course, it is up to you whether or not to contribute to Locast. But if you currently contribute, we humbly request that you continue to do so. And if you don’t contribute, we hope that you will do so if you can afford it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new fantasy sports-like prediction games let you blast your boldest picks to everyone you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLV8EKR4x_WUeGIyxna-B04TNu0=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805644/NRP_Fantasy_Games_on_Facebook_Inline_3__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of Facebook’s fantasy sports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BIxGuH"&gt;Facebook is adding fantasy sports-like prediction games that will let users guess what’s going to happen in sports, TV shows, and pop culture. The new games, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/"&gt;called Facebook Fantasy Games&lt;/a&gt;, are rolling out first on the iOS and Android apps for users in the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikji9v"&gt;The first game available is Pick &amp;amp; Play Sports, a daily sports prediction game it made in partnership with Whistle Sports. (It was already available in the iOS app for me, so it might be for you, too.) In the “upcoming months,” Facebook plans to release additional games for TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, sports leagues like Major League Baseball, and one made with &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed. &lt;/em&gt;Games will have public leaderboards, but you can also make your own public or private leagues if you want to compete with smaller groups or just talk trash. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDsxLMOt_YJab7j0jZUI3FjTSQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821138/NRP_Fantasy_Games_on_Facebook_In.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compete with your family and friends by making leagues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zH7Yba"&gt;The games don’t appear to have features that let you put real money on the line, though, so if you want to get into wagers, you’re going to have to handle those transactions yourself. It also doesn’t seem like Facebook is offering traditional fantasy sports leagues right now. But this could be Facebook’s first toe in the water to compete with big fantasy sports entities like DraftKings and ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sQPtV"&gt;Facebook has been expanding more into gaming as of late in an effort to keep people using its services. The company launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;web app for its cloud gaming service in July&lt;/a&gt; to get around Apple’s App Store rules and let iOS users to try it out. It also offers a Twitch-like streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/feed/"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. These new fantasy games offer something different than those more traditional gaming offerings, but they are perhaps a better fit for the social network — it seems easy to share a bold pick on your feed and wait for the reactions to roll in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech companies face pressure over January 6th subpoenas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Gadsden Flag flag left by Pro-Trump protesters who entered the U.S. Capitol building is seen after mass demonstrations in the nations capital during a joint session Congress to ratify President-elect Joe Biden on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJ-bqcDJ0b3uq-WwmxH85v8jVLU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805415/1230490671.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JCQLwx"&gt;As Congress pushes for more details of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, tech companies have found themselves caught between a new request from the select committee investigating the attack and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/jan-6-riot-mccarthy-trump-telecom-companies/2021/09/01/cad1753c-0b1d-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html"&gt;ominous threats from Republicans&lt;/a&gt; hoping to stall the committee’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxOkqc"&gt;Pushing for new details about communications between Republican members of Congress and President Trump during the attack, the House select committee sent data requests on Monday ordering the preservation of phone records and other communications related to the January 6th attack. Requests went out &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-committee-telecoms/2021/08/30/a2592168-0997-11ec-a6dd-296ba7fb2dce_story.html"&gt;to 35 companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft. Wireless providers like AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless also received the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O3H1LB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A Republican majority will not forget”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cynUsP"&gt;Notably, the requests are likely to target some members of Congress who communicated with President Trump during the attack. Both House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) reportedly discussed the attack with President Trump and could potentially be implicated by such a probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4ej0L"&gt;So far, Republican leaders have condemned the effort. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1432820807684739073"&gt;In a statement Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy described the subpoenas as an effort “to strong-arm private companies to turn over individuals’ private data” and threatened retaliation from future administrations if the companies complied with the orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHN99q"&gt;“If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,” McCarthy wrote. “If companies still choose to violate federal law, a Republican majority will not forget.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS8nJQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1432866784432979969"&gt;Speaking on Fox News that night&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) put the threat in blunter terms. “These telecommunication companies, if they go along with this, they will be shut down,” Greene said, “and that’s a promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArTP1x"&gt;Thus far, the companies at the center of the fight are mostly saying quiet. Google affirmed its commitment to working with the committee but did not explicitly commit to serving the data request. “We have received the Select Committee’s letter and are committed to working with Congress on this,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The events of January 6th were unprecedented and tragic, and Google and YouTube strongly condemn them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UMgJu"&gt;Reached by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook gave a similar statement, saying, “We have received the request and look forward to continuing to work with the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YClPnf"&gt;Microsoft and Twitter declined to comment, while Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;amp;T did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bans anti-vaccine subreddit r/NoNewNormal after site-wide protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YcYsMB1FBV95UyuCdereAQI_Jvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805134/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDlPkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/"&gt;Reddit has banned&lt;/a&gt; anti-vaccine and anti-mask subreddit r/NoNewNormal and has quarantined 54 other subreddits associated with COVID denial. A week ago, the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;company’s CEO said in a post&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit was meant to be a place of “open and authentic discussion and debate,” even for ideas that “question or disagree with popular consensus.” In today’s post, the company has clarified its rules with regard to health misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BnndB"&gt;The subreddit NoNewNormal has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;cited by many&lt;/a&gt; in the Reddit community as a source of vaccine misinformation, and it was known for “brigading” other subreddit’s discussions by butting in on conversations about COVID or related policies in other communities. NoNewNormal was the source of 80 such brigades in the past month, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/"&gt;according to Reddit security&lt;/a&gt;, and the behavior continued after the community was warned, leading to its ban. The community had &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqmg/reddit-quarantine-nonewnormal"&gt;previously been quarantined&lt;/a&gt;. For the 54 other subreddits that have been quarantined, Reddit warns potential visitors that medical advice should come from doctors rather than forum members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure you want to view this community? This community is&amp;amp;nbsp;quarantined This community is&amp;amp;nbsp;quarantined: For medical advice, please consult your physician.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WEQGEw"&gt;Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;along with other social networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;online marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;, has struggled with misinformation about COVID treatments in recent weeks. The platform has rules that seek to address the concerns but admits how it was interpreting and enforcing those rules hasn’t been clear. In today’s announcement, it stated that it classifies health misinformation as “falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader.” It also says that health disinformation means “falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead” and gives the example of posting fake advice attributed to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text that reads: Futurology has gone private to protest Reddit’s inaction on COVID-19 misinformation. Weaponized misinformation is a key problem shaping our Future. Reddit won’t enforce their policies against misinformation, brigading, and spamming. Misinformation subreddits such as NoNewNormal and r/conspiracy must be shut down. People are dying from misinformation." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSiXSz3PWcOThkUyoy-AdjMHsgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820677/Screen_Shot_2021_09_01_at_11.19.07_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="738uCs"&gt;In its post, Reddit cites users’ frustration with the platform’s “handling of COVID denial content.” Recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N8theGr8/comments/pelle1/subs_going_dark/"&gt;large number of Reddit’s most popular subs&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;been going private&lt;/a&gt;, hiding their posts from people who aren’t subscribed to them, to protest the company’s inaction. The action was partially spurred by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;the spread of misinformation around ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; — a drug whose veterinary form meant for livestock has been recommended as a cure for COVID, despite &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;the Food and Drug Administration’s warnings&lt;/a&gt; that using medicine for animals can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTLYYn"&gt;Even before Reddit’s announcement today, some users were trying to take the situation into their own hands — /r/Ivermectin has been spammed with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/comments/pfat0h/couldnt_get_ivermectin_going_to_try_this_instead/"&gt;shitposts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/comments/pf9b0c/trans_rights_trans_rights_trans_rights_trans/"&gt;calls for trans rights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pesfa4/rivermectin_has_been_classified_as_nsfw_as_users/"&gt;furry porn involving horses&lt;/a&gt;. (The link is a reasonably SFW explanation.) The latter got the sub marked as NSFW, and the flurry of posts has made it difficult to hold conversations on the now-quarantined community.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zV8ORq"&gt;The fast-approaching Labor Day holiday promises to bring plenty of great tech deals on notable favorites, including smart speakers, headphones, TVs, and tablets. While we regret to inform you that it is, sadly, not yet the weekend, there is a wide selection deals already available at retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and B&amp;amp;H Photo, many of which are likely to run through the rest of the week and into the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eq0I3N"&gt;Right now, there are savings to be had on devices like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 and second-gen Apple Pencil, and we’ll be sure to bring you more as the week unfolds, both on-site and in your inbox via our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;Verge Deals newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, check out these early Labor Day deals on a wide swath of tech goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

The current sale price is the best we’ve seen outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Right now, they’re $130 at Amazon, the cheapest we’ve seen the true wireless earbuds in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Normally $379, you can pick a refurbished pair with a two-year warranty at eBay for $100 off. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="UwF2fK"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750762530221522587#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini (64GB, Wi-Fi)&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly on track&lt;/a&gt; to receive an update in the fall, but the 2019 model still offers solid performance, a headphone jack, and twice the storage as the entry-level iPad. It’s available in silver at Best Buy for just $299, its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s official MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; is available on sale at Amazon for $30, a historical low it only recently hit. The Qi-compatible puck can magnetically attach to any model in the iPhone 12 lineup, and provide the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts of power when used in conjunction with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aL1xA4"&gt;The red &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm, GPS)&lt;/a&gt; is $319 at Amazon, a 20 percent discount on what we consider to be the best smartwatch available. Apple’s latest wearables features a fantastic display in addition to built-in sleeping tracking, though, it remains exclusive to iOS. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li id="Qqwe4N"&gt;Apple’s official &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Battery Case for the Phone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is just $52 at Amazon, matching the lowest price we’ve seen on the pricey charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2bflBD"&gt;Laptop deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NoAtnZ"&gt;

&lt;li id="X83rCF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Base-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B08LZYN1ZF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; is big, built nicer than most Windows laptops in its class, and offers solid performance even if you opt for the base model. Right now, Amazon has the Intel i7 six-core machine for $1,173, saving you nearly $327 on the 2020 model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our 2021 Razer Blade 15 base review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CcAnYV"&gt;Microsoft is offering up to $300 off a number of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; tablets. The base model with an Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage is $100 off for a starting price of $650, though there are numerous configurations on tap to satisfy whatever needs you may have from Microsoft’s versatile tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="HuwLBD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-32GN650-B-Ultragear-Reduction-FreeSync/dp/B08LLF9NS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG 32GN650-B QHD gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; may look like a jumble of letters and numbers but it also looks like a great value, one that comes with a 2560 x 1440 display, a 165Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time. Couple that with HDR10 support, FreeSync to prevent screen tearing, and a $297 price tag at Amazon, and you’ve got yourself a sweet 32-inch monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QgTlgI"&gt;Smart Home deals&lt;/h2&gt;

This $80 price tag has only been beaten during Amazon Prime Day, when Amazon devices are at their cheapest, but it’s still a great value for an affordable Alexa-equipped smart speaker that offers impressive sound quality and tunes itself based on the room. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The capable smart display — which is a bit sluggish, in our testing — can track your sleep if you choose it to be your bedside assistant, and it can display images directly from your Google Photos account. Walmart’s current discount brings the price down to $70, regardless of which color you choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5iQopm"&gt;The 10-inch &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750565611530617461#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt; is best put to use as a video calling device, especially with tech-averse family members who already use Facebook. Best Buy’s latest discount brings the Portal down to $100, matching its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Even with its small stature, it can do just about anything other Echo speakers can do, even if it is limited when it comes to video calling and video streaming. Today, you can buy it for just $55 ($30 off) at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EhBQDn"&gt;Philips is running a promotion on its &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750569053894295875#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hue White and Color E26 smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy a three-pack of the colorful bulbs, you pay the same price as you would for two of them, effectively a discount of $35 that brings the price of three bulbs down to $100. Philips doesn’t often discount its app-enabled bulbs, and this is a great way to get started with smart lighting or stock up.&lt;/li&gt;

You don’t have to be a streamer to appreciate the better video quality and a bit of fill-in light even on a casual Zoom call, either, and you can get the Kiyo at Amazon for just $64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7K6hXb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G Pro gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is about as sleek, minimalist, and lightweight as it gets when it comes to wireless, high-performance mice. It was developed with consultation from pro gamers, but it has an ambidextrous design that doesn’t scream “gamer” from a half-mile away. It’s now on sale for $85, its lowest price to date, at Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="67Du69"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LQX2GXZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steel Series Aerox 3 Super Light&lt;/a&gt; gaming mouse weighs only 57 grams and is only $40 at Amazon right now. The speedy, affordable peripheral even comes with RGB lighting. &lt;/li&gt;
