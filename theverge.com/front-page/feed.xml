    <title>Google removes its algorithmic ‘Your News Update’ from Assistant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fuauzd0xNg-u9NJjauplH_BrgEg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102117/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-8.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dguwI8"&gt;Google has quietly removed its “Your News Update” feature from Assistant, axing the algorithmically personalized audio digest in favor of the company’s existing (and more traditional) news briefings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/05/google-assistant-your-news-update/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgQTbX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972336/google-assistant-audio-news-feed-algorithm"&gt;Originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Your News Update was an attempt at bringing the same kinds of algorithmic feeds that had been so successful on Facebook or other areas of Google’s products to audio news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeVBm1"&gt;Instead of users picking their three specific new sources (like NPR, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, or CNN), Your News Update would rely on Google’s wealth of personal data to offer far more specific and relevant news updates from a broad range of partners that Google was licensing news from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyibrR"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn pointed out at the time of release, the issue with that kind of system is that it relies on being very, very accurate, especially for audio — where you have to listen through each news story, which is far more time consuming than a text-based version. Plus, as anyone who’s used Google’s algorithmic headline feature in its apps lately knows, Google’s guesses at what you’re interested in can be pretty hit or miss. And of course, there was the same issue with algorithmic feeds here as anywhere else on the internet — that of falling into a self-selected bubble of filtered news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i0LRD"&gt;There’s no official word from Google as to why it’s deprecated the feature, so we may never know for sure the reasoning behind Google abandoning it to its ever-increasing product graveyard. Google Assistant still offers its original news digest option, however, so users won’t be left in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fixes bug that could cause macOS Monterey to brick Macs with a T2 security chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6_98URhHffSHEz69GzapRBq7IU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102063/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6z6zGs"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;macOS Monterey was released&lt;/a&gt;, there have been several Apple users who said that installing the update bricked their computers. It was unclear what might have caused the issue until today, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1456672355992866816"&gt;Rene Ritchie reports&lt;/a&gt;, he has received this statement from Apple citing an issue with the firmware of its T2 security chip (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/05/apple-rolls-out-fix-for-macos-monterey-bug-that-bricked-some-macs-with-the-t2-chip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V2k1Qg"&gt;We have identified and fixed an issue with the firmware on the Apple T2 security chip that prevented a very small number of users from booting up their Mac after updating macOS. The updated firmware is now included with the existing macOS updates. Any users impacted by this issue can contact Apple Support for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0xVEQS"&gt;There aren’t any specifics on the models affected, possible settings or configurations that are vulnerable, or exactly what a “small number of users” adds up to. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/macos-monterey-bricking-older-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to find tweets from at least nine MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac owners who said their devices didn’t boot up after the update. It’s good that they can reach out to Apple Support for assistance, but it’s also unclear if those people will be able to retain any data locked in affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanj1N"&gt;The T2 security chip has appeared in a number of Apple computers (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;you can check the list here&lt;/a&gt;) since it was introduced in 2018. Apple says that updated firmware to eliminate the issue is now included in existing macOS updates (some trackers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/1456669546945916935"&gt;noted a refreshed version of the BridgeOS 6.0 software&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the T2 going out today), so it shouldn’t be an issue on any of those machines from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is hosting an education-focused event on November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ujswkIGyhKeJ90ss8VnmfZI-YY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101981/vpavic_210930_4784_0064.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft just launched the affordable Surface Go 3, but maybe it will reveal new hardware at an education-focused event on Tuesday.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ibw7yM"&gt;Microsoft is hosting an event next week focused on education technology. It’s taking place November 9th at 12PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31wHJq"&gt;Details are light, but here’s &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/reimagine-education-2021/"&gt;Microsoft’s description of the event&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AQ32AL"&gt;Join us at 9 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Nov. 9, as we share an inside look at the latest tech solutions while examining gaps in learning left by the pandemic. Hear from Microsoft partners, school leaders and a few special guests, and learn about new and existing technology from Microsoft Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Slw1HM"&gt;The event arrives just over a month after the company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11, its next major operating system&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the company will detail upcoming education-focused updates on the way for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLNENe"&gt;Microsoft’s vague hint about “new and existing technology” indicates we could see new hardware revealed at the event as well. The company just revealed a wave of new Surface products at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;an event in September&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe the company isn’t done introducing new hardware in 2021 just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some new BMWs won't have touchscreens thanks to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbAFHA5qmrUhp9pp1jzOCf6UFv4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101745/BMW_MY22_3Series_Tech_Carousel_03_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiuAQs"&gt;BMW is dropping touchscreens from many of its new cars due to the chip shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bimmerfest.com/threads/major-option-restriction-announcement.1420312/"&gt;forum post on BimmerFest&lt;/a&gt; and later confirmed by the car company to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Fyour-new-bmw-might-not-have-a-touchscreen.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765709%2Fbmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/05/bmws-losing-touchscreen-functionality/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AutoBlog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While we’ve seen other auto manufactures have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;pause production&lt;/a&gt; or cut other features, this omission is a big deal — nowadays, touchscreens are a fairly standard feature in cars, and not having one will affect how you interact with the car almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LA3oqI"&gt;According to the BimmerFest post, some affected vehicles (which include the 3 Series sedans, and X5, X6, and X7 SUVs / crossovers) will also lose access to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAWycJA1r4"&gt;backup assistant feature&lt;/a&gt; as well, which automatically backs into spots for you after recording how you drove through them going forward. The post also says that cars shipped without touchscreens will come with a $500 credit and will require both a software update and the customer to sign a form with the dealer to acknowledge that they know about the feature deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5oocp"&gt;Instead of the touchscreen, users will have to rely on a controller in the center console, which features touchpad-like abilities. It’s a divisive input option between reviewers, but I doubt most people would choose it over the touchscreen under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GfZssJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oCXwjqQ7P4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tiFbIA"&gt;What’s worse is that, practically speaking, you probably won’t be able to get a touchscreen installed after the fact with the $500 you’re saving from the deletion. At this point, then, it may be best to just try and wait it out — while the chip shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;is expected to last until at least 2023&lt;/a&gt;, cars are often a long-term purchase. Do you really want to be using a touchpad instead of a touchscreen in, say, 2030?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWw8X"&gt;BMW isn’t the only company making cuts to its vehicles to deal with shortages — GM has dropped features as well, from the relatively innocuous like &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage"&gt;HD radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;built-in wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; on some models to serious omissions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;fuel management modules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/41008/gm-drops-auto-stop-start-from-v8-silverados-and-sierras-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;auto stop-start&lt;/a&gt; on some of its V8s and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;much-touted Super Cruise hands-free driving mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has big, new plans to pull CO2 out of the air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s Largest Carbon-Sucking Plant Starts Making Tiny Dent in Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5D6pwELgrKzVkXoGmE8VFHLVe4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101735/1235138673.0.jpg" /&gt;

Startups Climeworks and Carbfix are working together to store carbon dioxide removed from the air deep underground to reverse some of the damage CO2 emissions are doing to the planet. | Arnaldur Halldorsson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Nk9uk"&gt;Despite the efforts of delegates at this month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;climate summit in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, the world is still &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/"&gt;careening toward&lt;/a&gt; potentially catastrophic levels of global warming. Now, some countries and corporations are turning to new technologies to pull carbon out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UynXW"&gt;Today, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced a bold new &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to make those technologies, called carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, cost-effective and scalable with the launch of a new “Carbon Negative Shot” initiative. Through this initiative, the agency seeks to bring the cost of CDR down dramatically this decade — to less than $100 a ton — so that it can be deployed at a big enough scale to remove “gigatons,” or billions of tons, of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nkLze9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ER2qzI"&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution. Sequestering one gigaton of carbon dioxide would amount to removing the pollution of about 250 million vehicles — the US’s entire light-duty fleet — in one year, according to the DOE. With CDR technologies still in pretty early stages of development, there are significant hurdles to overcome before the DOE can do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4Hoyc"&gt;CDR is a suite of strategies aimed at drawing down CO2 to keep it from trapping heat in the atmosphere. Nature can do some of that for us — trees and plants pull CO2 out of the air. There’s also “direct air capture” technology that mimics that process using carbon-sucking machines, but it has yet to be deployed at a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nub7c"&gt;To draw down enough&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;heat-trapping pollution, the US will likely need large-scale direct air capture plants. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;largest direct air capture plant&lt;/a&gt; came online in Iceland earlier this year, and it’s only able to pull out 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s roughly equivalent to the emissions from 790 passenger vehicles in a year. To date, there are only 19 direct air capture plants around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and they only have the capacity to capture a tiny fraction of what the DOE’s aims are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDBR69"&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further. Companies like Microsoft pay about $600 for each ton of CO2 the Iceland plant captures. The company pumped out the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;11,164,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of carbon dioxide in its 2020 fiscal year. At $600 a ton, Microsoft would need to pay almost $6.7 billion to remove just one year of its pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SgdgXt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OC97CX"&gt;But cost isn’t the only challenge. Direct air capture plants trap CO2 &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;using filters or chemical solutions&lt;/a&gt;. To release the trapped CO2 so that it can be safely stored, the filter or chemical solution needs to be heated up to very high temperatures — between 100 and 900 degrees Celsius. That takes a lot of energy. In a catch-22, the machines that pull carbon out of the air could wind up using as much as a quarter of the global energy supply by 2100, according to a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. If that energy comes from burning fossil fuels, it could contribute to the problem it’s trying to solve. (And it’s still technically difficult to use purely renewable energy to reach the extremely high temperatures required for the chemical solution method of direct air capture.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s likely why the DOE says in its announcement today that it wants to ensure that “emissions created when running and building the removal technology are accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTwkeY"&gt;Lastly, the DOE is aiming to secure places to store CO2 where it can be monitored for at least 100 years. It ideally needs to stay sequestered for much longer to keep humanity from falling deeper into climate crisis. At the Iceland plant, CO2 is pumped underground, where the companies behind the project say it can be stored in rock formations for thousands of years. Volcanically active Iceland has relatively young and porous basalt rock that’s ideal for this kind of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7ZnNS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Billions of dollars for new pipelines and carbon storage infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rugyA6"&gt;The US will not only need to find similarly well-suited locations — it’ll need to transport it there via new pipelines. The Biden administration’s infrastructure bill that’s inching closer to a final vote includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;billions of dollars for new pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, and $3.5 billion for four direct air capture “hubs.” That already has some environmental groups concerned about pipeline ruptures, like one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;sickened residents of a small, majority-Black community&lt;/a&gt; in Mississippi last year. At high concentrations, carbon dioxide is a dangerous asphyxiant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zBBif"&gt;Despite all those challenges, leading climate scientists working with the United Nations have included carbon removal in &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt; for limiting the climate crisis to somewhat manageable levels. That’s gotten &lt;a href="https://www.ienearth.org/hands-off-mother-earth/"&gt;criticism from some progressive activists&lt;/a&gt; who see carbon removal as a distraction from transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. And even experts optimistic about the future of the technology caution that it’s meant to be a side dish and not the main course in any plan to combat climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDpjZW"&gt;“It is at most a supplement that can help us reduce climate change,” David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in September&lt;/a&gt; when the Iceland plant came online. “But it can’t take the place of cutting emissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09oN5G"&gt;The US, the world’s second-biggest CO2 polluter, still needs to focus primarily on finding alternatives to fossil fuels so that it can prevent greenhouse gas emissions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are now available online at Walmart (update: sold out)</title>

  &lt;p id="WX2inP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:50PM ET, November 5th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart’s restock of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles came and went in about 40 minutes, which seems to be par for the course these days. We saw its newer queue system at play, and while the first 20 minutes seemed to count down correctly, we noticed that the queue began to hang and slow down if it did not drop entirely. While many folks have probably seen the “We are having technical issues” message that spells certain doom, hopefully some lucky ones landed their console of choice. We will continue looking out for more console restocks to give you advance notice whenever possible. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lwGDm"&gt;It’s November, and the holiday shopping season is well upon us. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; have already begun, and there’s sure to be a lot more in store for us come actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;. But the hottest tickets of the season, just as they were last year, are the still-hard-to-get consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Today, we bring some good news for you. Walmart has just launched its restock of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles, starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, Friday, November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxC1Bo"&gt;The consoles are hard enough to come by, but we don’t always get a drop of both Sony and Microsoft consoles at the same time — Walmart has been the only one doing so recently. Today’s restock will include the disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; and its less-costly sibling, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $400&lt;/a&gt;. On the Microsoft front, Walmart’s offerings for today only include the top-tier &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X for $500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS6qwo"&gt;We strongly advise creating or logging in to your Walmart account in advance of 3PM. Make sure you already have your correct billing and shipping information added to minimize potential risk of delays or issues during the checkout process. If you don’t land the console of your choice right at 3PM, be sure to keep trying as Walmart often releases more stock in 10-minute increments until it’s all cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUv6RI"&gt;Since buying a console is only one part of the equation, we have gone ahead and pulled together some key accessories, game subscriptions, and notable titles you might also consider during your purchase. Many of the options below are on sale or discounted, unlike the consoles, so you can save some money as you step into the latest gaming generation. We’ve even got an exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers on a 12-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, this weekend only or while supplies last, for just &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeConsoles110521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__www.eneba.com_us_psn-2Dplaystation-2Dnetwork-2Dcard-2Dpsn-2D365-2Ddays-2Dusa-2Dpsn-2Dkey-2Dunited-2Dstates%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3D7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg%26r%3Dxk5KiED8BX7y2-_MCQb470KHOk8NhVXPerTCKuSIIjV9vZUa0o8dpEMoOMF_A_wF%26m%3DnV_0DHdj0FhX_webKkESlfOjCg5lBh3t9p_DUdvg5mhzeaqtP1R_v-b87nWieZeN%26s%3DrupKh2MCtibQPWxgcP1bIsJano46ZNTZUIXKXiEjHlg%26e%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 from Eneba&lt;/a&gt; (use code &lt;strong&gt;PLUSYEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout). If picking up any of these accessories or titles at Walmart, add them to your cart ahead of time so you’re ready to go if you manage to nab a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWPq1j"&gt;Good luck, and happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft fixes Windows 11 features failing due to an expired certificate </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ai_qQi2DlAXsIr_erIZFVPM0ORc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101483/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8GxFCI"&gt;Microsoft has fixed several Windows 11 features failing to load after an expired certificate was discovered earlier this week. Some Windows 11 users haven’t been able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel since a certificate expired on October 31st. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763641/microsoft-windows-11-expired-certificate-snipping-tool-emoji-picker-issues"&gt;Microsoft warned Windows 11 users about the problems earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and has now released an out-of-band update today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSAcbA"&gt;The issues also affected voice typing and the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. Microsoft started &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/04/releasing-windows-11-kb5008295-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;testing a patch&lt;/a&gt; for the problems with Beta and Release Preview testers of Windows 11 late yesterday and has now &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#2743"&gt;released the fix&lt;/a&gt; for all Windows 11 users today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ddo3zn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft is releasing an Out-of-band (OOB) update (KB5008295) today to completely resolve a set of issues affecting the Snipping Tool, Touch Keyboard, some built-in apps and S Mode on Windows 11. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8XaFZqRH3J"&gt;https://t.co/8XaFZqRH3J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows Update (@WindowsUpdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUpdate/status/1456677227010007046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TW9nAt"&gt;If you’re running Windows 11, you should be offered the &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5008295"&gt;KB5008295&lt;/a&gt; update today, and it will automatically install from Windows Update. This patch does require a reboot, and Microsoft notes it will address all of the issues from the expired certificate, including the accounts page in Windows 11 with S mode failing to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geklPq"&gt;Microsoft was relatively quick to address these problems after the company discovered the certificate issue on Monday. It’s unusual for Microsoft to issue out-of-band patches that aren’t security-related for its Windows operating systems, and this is one of the first emergency-style fixes for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJftcW"&gt;Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 patch comes just two weeks after the company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22732336/microsoft-windows-11-amd-cpu-performance-issues-fix-release"&gt;issue a fix for AMD CPU performance in the OS&lt;/a&gt;. A bug was slowing performance on Ryzen processors by up to 15 percent in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing’s big update has sucked me back in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YIVm1XGXX7TGVR-HOkWmBYJIXIo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101376/2021110420240900_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGbgJS"&gt;It’s been a long time since I’ve been surprised by &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"&gt;I played the Nintendo Switch game regularly for the first year it was out&lt;/a&gt;, checking in virtually every day to see how my village was progressing. I experienced every holiday and special event and spent my evenings catching fish and tending to my gardens before bed. But, despite a handful of updates, I eventually got bored. There’s only so many sea bass you can catch before it becomes monotonous. I haven’t touched the game in eight months (as my villagers have been quick to point out), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22762709/animal-crossing-2-0-update-released-early-nintendo"&gt;the latest, biggest, and final update&lt;/a&gt; has really sucked me back into island life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPPVry"&gt;Perhaps the most surprising part of this is that I haven’t even experienced the most notable parts of the update yet. I haven’t purchased the first paid expansion, which lets you help decorate other characters’ homes, and the much-anticipated café addition to my museum is still under construction until tomorrow. I’m excited for both of these — I sincerely love Brewster the barista — but it’s the smaller changes that have helped refresh a game that had been feeling stale for me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S9HWnz74DTgxri8WXGSDE9djFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988862/2021110420323700_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e5inv8"&gt;For instance, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; now has cooking. It works a lot like regular crafting: you get a recipe, collect the ingredients, and then go to a stove to put it all together. The food is adorable and detailed, and it makes my kitchen look a lot more cozy. But more importantly, it has changed my relationship with my island. At this point, I’ve caught nearly every fish and collected plenty of fruit. But now, they have new possibilities. Catching a fish could mean getting a new recipe, even if it’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22763373/animal-crossing-new-horizons-cooking-sea-bass"&gt;the typically unwanted sea bass&lt;/a&gt;. I finally have a reason to go diving for seaweed. I also have a new incentive to collect everything; once you complete a collection in the museum, you can buy a cool poster full of fossils or bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDbKRX"&gt;Likewise, the new camera app makes it a lot more fun to wander around the island and snap pics. There’s a first-person viewpoint that lets you see things from a new perspective, as well as a tripod so you can take cute pics with your villagers. Ordinances, which return from &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;, let you make your island a little cleaner or ensure your animals stay up late to match your own schedule. You will also get visitors now as villagers will show up at your house unannounced to hang out. The most surprising bonus, for me, has been that I finally have a reason to visit Harv’s island because you can now set up a kind of marketplace full of folks like Leif and his plant shop and a new fortune teller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwtnXmmrJ6t9Jp0yQsFMWKKXEBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988864/2021110511201300_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F9FNBd"&gt;These changes make the game feel new and interesting again, and I haven’t even dug into many of the aspects, like growing gyroids, hanging out in a coffee shop, or collecting new furniture. It’s also nice that the game forces you to pace yourself. At Harv’s co-op, for instance, you can only add one business each day, and they all cost 100,000 bells to set up. It’ll be a while before I have a fully functioning market, but this hasn’t bothered me. I forgot how pleasant it can be to play the game for 20 minutes, get a few chores done, and then return the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apgHXu"&gt;It’s not just one feature that has me excited about &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; again. Instead, it’s all of these smaller details that make the day-to-day of playing much more interesting. I’m not sure how long it’ll last, and it’s sad that this is the game’s last hurrah. But I know I’ll be sticking around my island for at least long enough to get that fish poster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo says its next ‘gaming system’ will release in the year 20XX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sp6afPclqz7FRWWkTk6jzNS0Kss=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101274/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the OLED Switch, not Nintendo’s next console.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ihvCPN"&gt;The Nintendo Switch with an OLED screen isn’t even a month old, but the company is already talking about some kind of successor to its wildly popular console / handheld hybrid — although vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2QcUh"&gt;In a presentation to investors, Nintendo hints toward some of its plans in an extremely unspecific way. The company plans to “continue to expand its business around the core concept of creating unique integrated hardware-software products,” which I’m taking to mean that the company will (brace yourself) make more video games and video game hardware in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhGvpt"&gt;On the slide, which you can see for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105e.pdf"&gt;on page 41 here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo also has a timeline of some of its hardware efforts and specifically includes its “next gaming system” slated to release at an undefined 20XX date. (So sometime between now and 2099, I guess.) There are no hints as to what the hardware might look like, if it will be another hybrid like the Switch, or even just another revision of the Switch. The only image Nintendo includes is a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8M216Y8GQsu46p7-a46OIxow4R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988754/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_9.31.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even Nintendo wants you to forget the Wii U, which released in 2012 and isn’t included on this timeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glY3ih"&gt;While I love the OLED Switch, there are some obvious ways new Nintendo hardware could improve upon it, with perhaps the most obvious upgrade being the ability to play 4K resolution games. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported a Switch that could do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;was in development for release this year&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;official OLED Switch doesn’t support 4K games&lt;/a&gt;. Just days before the launch of the OLED Switch, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was developing a 4K-capable Switch and said it could be released as early as late 2022, but Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;categorically denied&lt;/a&gt; that report. If there was a feature I’d bet on for Nintendo’s next console, though, it would be 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlLVBH"&gt;Nintendo isn’t just investing in hardware; the company is also committing to “value-added services” for Nintendo accounts, and the upward-trending blue triangle in the image above suggests that could be a bigger part of Nintendo’s business in the future. We’re already starting to see that play out with the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a more expensive version of its paid online membership that adds Nintendo 64 games, Sega Genesis games, and access the new &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKzR01"&gt;The company also says it will “continue to improve and expand” both the standard Nintendo Switch Online and the Expansion Pack&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;While Nintendo doesn’t detail exactly how, one thing to potentially look forward to would be Game Boy games, which are rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656353/nintendo-game-boy-game-boy-color-games-switch-online-subscription"&gt;to join Nintendo’s online offerings&lt;/a&gt; at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icBKMd"&gt;In classic Nintendo fashion, the company is keeping its cards close, and it usually doesn’t reveal hardware, services, or games until it can give some concrete details. (Though I’m still waiting for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; more about &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt; since its reboot was announced &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/977978a1-07fe-4c58-8dd9-8fe68f764c04#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;nearly three years ago&lt;/a&gt;.) But it’s fun to imagine what might be in the hopper, especially now that the company has alluded to future hardware in the works. I can’t wait for 20XX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Glow review: fun but unfinished</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to like about this intergenerational calling device, but Amazon is a bit bossy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4RDYdT"&gt;Amazon’s latest attempt to entertain your children is an innovative effort that combines an interactive projector with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus’&lt;/a&gt; excellent catalog of child-friendly content. What it is not is an Alexa device, despite having four microphones built in and sharing a name with the Echo lamp for kids. Rather than being a part of Amazon’s growing, open smart home ecosystem, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DWNZQYM?ref=+ods_lp_day1_io_ja&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 Amazon Glow&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive, manicured walled garden for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GApn0k"&gt;A video calling / interactive gaming device specifically designed to make it easier for children to communicate with friends and family remotely, the Amazon Glow is attempting to make these rather forced interactions more natural, engaging, and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hadjHo"&gt;Where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"&gt;Facebook’s Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; tries to solve the problem of wriggly, distractible kids by making a portable device that lets you bring the conversation to where they are, Amazon tries to keep your kid captivated with Grandma via a stationary tabletop projector. A 19.2-inch projected play area encourages more active play, letting grandparent, aunt, uncle, or second cousin not just watch your child draw, paint, or play games but join in the fun — albeit in a slightly terrifying, disembodied head format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="agsnRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XMv4n"&gt;Unfortunately, coming with an entirely new hardware platform makes the Glow too expensive, and its limitations mean it’s not likely to replace a tablet as your child’s tech toy of choice. I would also caution anyone considering investing in this as a holiday gift that Glow is part of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21601403011"&gt;Amazon’s Day1 Editions&lt;/a&gt; program, which could mean the company is still figuring out if it wants to commit to this product. You also can’t just go and buy this; you have to request an invitation, although you do get it at the slightly discounted price of $249 for your trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G9Esp"&gt;Adding to the initial outlay is an ongoing monthly content subscription (starting at $2.99 a month but included for the first year) and the need for whoever your child is calling to have a tablet for the best experience. (It also doesn’t currently work with Fire tablets, which can be had pretty cheap, but Amazon says compatibility is coming soon.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOZzP"&gt;However, Amazon does offer a two-year guarantee and free replacement if it breaks — which is a good thing as this nearly took a nose dive off our kitchen counter several times. Also, there are no ads anywhere to be found in the Glow, which is a refreshing change for an Amazon device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5RoUu5bKb5I0VRahw2EZ3MQD_l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977076/jtuohy_211027_4856_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My 10-year-old chatting with her grandma while they both draw in the Glow’s art program. The 8-inch portrait screen that displays the caller’s head is a bit awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h82HuW"&gt;At just over 14 inches tall, the Glow is a towering device resembling a squared-off Echo speaker with an eight-inch touchscreen on the front to show the remote caller. A 720p camera sits above the screen to capture the child and their actions, and a 10-watt speaker sits below it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBBzfP"&gt;Two-way audio is enabled by four microphones above the protruding hunk of plastic that houses a projector. This beams a 19.2-inch touch-sensitive projection screen onto a specially designed white mat where IR sensors and a second camera enable interaction. Also included are seven tangram puzzle pieces, which you can scan into special puzzles and play with both digitally and physically. All of this takes up a significant amount of space, however, and it can be challenging to find a good spot for it; plus, the device is not very portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeVPxM"&gt;The Glow is powered by a short, removable power cord, and there is a physical privacy shutter that cuts off video and microphones, plus a power button and volume up and down button along the side. It’s designed for kids ages three to nine to chat and play with remote family and friends, and it takes advantage of Amazon’s strong parental control features (so, there’s no worry that your child is going to wander off down an internet rabbit hole, and there is no web-browser in the Glow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oykBsow-vGyj9vlKGXjoBFPFw_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977073/jtuohy_211027_4856_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projector sits above a 720p camera that captures what the child is doing and sends it to their virtual playmate. A physical shutter can be engaged at any time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JhrgZq"&gt;The child uses the hands-free Glow device, and the remote user plays on a tablet (iPad or Android). You can’t currently play Glow to Glow, and while there are some games you can play solo or side by side, the concept here is resolutely about interacting with someone who lives elsewhere, not about adding another personal screen into your home. In reality, this means if you want to play on the Glow with your child while you’re at home, you’ll have to sit in another room with a tablet. It feels like someone didn’t really think that through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7OzO"&gt;Unlike most video-calling devices, this is designed to offer two slightly different experiences for the participants. While each participant sees the same interface that consists of digital bookshelves from which you select games, puzzles, books, and activities, and each can control that interface, the adult gets more prompts and controls than the child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTN11E"&gt;It feels specifically designed for the Glow user to be a tech-savvy child who can instinctively control things with touch and would otherwise get bored and distracted by talking to a 2D face on a screen. The tablet user designation seems to be an older person who requires more text-based prompts and guidance when grappling with this new-fangled technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK2_MmHrdS17psY1zC4Ee0fKntk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988402/A4CCD05B_EE8E_4491_A84A_F2035E345F33.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet interface in the Glow app shows you an inset video of the child, and the same gameplay screen but from your perspective. If you tap on the caller you can view yourself and them but not the gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6JRQ"&gt;While I get where Amazon is coming from here, this stereotyping feels uncomfortable. And feeds into my chief complaint with the Glow: it’s too tightly controlled. I’m not talking about privacy or parental controls, those are all present and correct. I mean the gameplay. After an hour or so of testing it with my 10-year-old daughter and her 74-year-old grandmother, we ran into several restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpsYuj"&gt;For example, a game of chess (which was incredibly fun and cleverly executed) refused to let me win. It insisted the game was a draw, even though I had thoroughly checkmated my kid. It was like being told by a teacher that you’re not allowed to do that until you’re old enough to handle it. Also, while you can download books from the Kids Plus catalog, only picture books and graphic novels work, not chapter books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmAr4Q"&gt;I was also flummoxed to find out that despite the device having Bluetooth, you cannot pair Bluetooth headsets to the Glow. “[That] is not possible with Glow as part of the fun for parents is to be able to hear their child speaking with a remote family member or friend, just like a playdate in person, and joining the conversation if they choose,” Amazon PR told me in an email. Thanks, but I don’t need to be told how to have fun with my kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plw0w_eW4q3K3GbbNMjklj4xY88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977077/jtuohy_211027_4856_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art screen lets a child’s creativity roam, but beware of the vacuum cleaner icon, which either player can use to erase your work in an instant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dCcqdk"&gt;An excellent use case for this device for work-from-home parents is to pop their child on a call with a friend or family member if they need to get some work done. It’s much less guilt-inducing than sticking on another &lt;em&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; marathon to get through your weekly team meeting. But for that to work in a small apartment, for example, headphones on your child would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5fdBl"&gt;While my children aren’t the target age range here (at least not yet — Amazon told me it is planning to bring more content tailored toward older children), my 10-year-old daughter really enjoyed many of the games. Her favorite feature by far was the interactive art area, where you can let your creativity roam free from most of the device’s restraints and even scan real-life objects into your masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uKnhRt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Glow scanning|104696" data-volume-uuid="fe35039c2" data-volume-id="104696" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-932" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demonstration of how the scanning feature works to add everyday objects into your art projects on the Amazon Glow. The results are fine but the colors are quite grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AymQ5"&gt;Setting up the Glow is straightforward, but it has to be done by an adult — it’s not a toy in itself. Plug it in, turn it on, scan the QR code displayed on the screen to download the Glow app. You can use a phone or tablet but the interactive experience is much better on a tablet. The app connects to the Glow over Bluetooth and enables a connection to your Wi-Fi network (2.4GHz or 5GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKPlo9"&gt;Next, you sign in with your Amazon account (one is required to use the Glow and the companion app) and select your profile and add your children. If you already have an Amazon Kids account, they will show up, or you can create profiles for them. You can then add friends and family and choose which child they can interact with (if you have more than one). As a nice touch, you can change the family member’s name to one the child uses for them. Currently, the Glow app is only available to download in the US, so you won’t be able to chat with friends and family who live overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="eUsBmt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My chief complaint with the Glow is it’s too tightly controlled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WR8TqZ"&gt;When you add a contact, a download link for the Glow app is sent to them. On the other end, it gets a bit more complicated. Grandma or Grandpa has to sign in to their Amazon account (or sign up for one), add a mobile number, receive a text message confirmation code, and enter it in the app to enable Alexa calling. It’s also never made clear that it’s best to do this on a tablet, not a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nanRUZ"&gt;Once set up, the child can call a contact by tapping on their avatar on the touchscreen, and the call comes in on the tablet like an Alexa call on an Echo smart display (although this is not an Alexa device). Once you answer it, both participants can see and control the game space and see each other. I like the interface because neither person sees themselves — you only see your playmate and the games, which helps a lot in limiting distractions. Although, this did often mean the grandparent wasn’t properly in the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PdFzjL1xdZd0fQ7QN_-GDZboHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988607/jtuohy_211028_4856_0017_blurred.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chess is one of the few games you can play side by side (i.e. without being in a call) and was a favorite during our testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxaZCS"&gt;The Glow has an impressive amount of content at launch, leaning heavily on the Amazon Kids Plus’ books library (there is no video anywhere to be found, which is a good thing) and introducing several entirely new games and puzzles. Some of our favorites were Bubble Game (where you work against the clock and your opponent to burst bubbles holding your designated letter), Paddle Battle (a variant of the Pong arcade game), and card games Crazy 8s, Go Fish, and Slapjack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRHUPD"&gt;But it was chess that took over most of our testing time. I’d been trying to get my daughter into chess for years, and she’s always resisted. But here, with an instant setup and hints on how to play, she was quickly captivated. She also loved that you could play in different worlds (with the pieces dressed up according to the theme) and that each piece was animated. When you move a piece into a dangerous zone, it starts shaking and looking scared. When you move one to a good spot, it looks smug. Fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; educational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGu31WRLgaKy3ULjrlsqq2Xk38U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977080/jtuohy_211028_4856_0019_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other person in the call uses the Glow app on an iPad (iOS14 or higher) or Android (OS 8 or higher) tablet to interact with the child using the Glow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVjG2"&gt;Perhaps the best feature of Glow overall is that the games learn your competency as you play, starting out easy but quickly escalating in difficulty as you do well, helping keep the child engaged. Each activity also starts with plenty of hints and prompts to make it clear whose turn it is and what you should be doing, taking a lot of the tiring explanation out of teaching a child (or grandparent) a new game. A lot of these do require the child be able to read, though, so for younger children the picture books from Disney, Mattel, and others are another highlight of the device, with interactive touch points for the child and conversation hints on the adult’s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tPco8P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1kMuls"&gt;The gameplay was primarily smooth, but we did encounter a fair amount of freezing, slow loading, and glitches. Not surprising for a first-gen product that’s still in the testing stages, but frustrating all the same, causing my daughter to throw up her hands in annoyance and wander off during a game of Paddle Battle. (Again, this is a beta product for which you’re paying hundreds of dollars.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="OVZuHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kChYEW"&gt;The device is also slightly underpowered, and despite not being required to produce high-end graphics, a little more juice could help keep things flowing more smoothly. The video quality on the built-in 1280 x 800 resolution touchscreen was also often highly pixelated, and audio became robotic and garbled a few times. This was likely due to a poor internet connection on the other end, but something to bear in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhCSJa"&gt;The Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished, a bit rough around the edges, and too limiting. However, I hope Amazon keeps working on it as it has plenty of potential as a kids’ entertainment device as well as for other applications. Touch-enabled projection technology makes a ton of sense in the home when you don’t want screens everywhere. A small, voice-activated projection device tucked up under a kitchen cabinet that could project on your kitchen counter or wall when you need a recipe or to see the feed from your video doorbell could easily be the next evolution of Amazon’s smart home efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6K5h5O"&gt;But for now, you’ll probably want to pass on paying to join this beta test and wait for Amazon to fully flesh this product out before diving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJouLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
