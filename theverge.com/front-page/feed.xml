    <title>Windows 11 Home will require a Microsoft account and an internet connection at setup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9vN6rnmvc4klgbpA73exjXWn5J8=/178x0:1735x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499291/Da63BN3T7y.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7WFFr"&gt;Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 on Thursday, and its least expensive version Windows 11 Home will now require an internet connection at setup — and a Microsoft account. Previous versions would let you opt out of Microsoft accounts by creating a local account instead, though the company didn’t necessarily make it easy to find and &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/442609/confirmed-windows-10-setup-now-prevents-local-account-creation/"&gt;pushed you to use&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s login instead. It’s possible you’ll still be able to use a local account afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F67ybN"&gt;The internet requirement may make sense since Windows 11 will largely be delivered via a Windows Update, like many of the updates to Windows 10, so you’d need an internet connection to install it on your PC. You’ll need to make sure your machine has enough free storage space to install the updates, Microsoft notes in its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications%23primaryR3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMMt5b"&gt;The minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11 are a PC with 64-bit CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. It will be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546801/microsoft-windows-11-free-upgrade-details"&gt;free upgrade &lt;/a&gt;for existing Windows 10 users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aq6oWZ"&gt;Here’s how Microsoft describes these requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1BD4Z"&gt;Windows 11 Home edition requires internet connectivity and a Microsoft account to complete device setup on first use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrWiNZ"&gt;Switching a device out of Windows 11 Home in S mode also requires internet connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liqhjd"&gt;For all Windows 11 editions, internet access is required to perform updates and to download and take advantage of some features. A Microsoft account is required for some features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s news feed has built-in tipping to support local content creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k94wNIwZ3CgtAqxAg37FItfn9Bw=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499108/windows11event_000719.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fgMSkX"&gt;Supporting local news sources is suddenly something the tech industry worries about, and with Windows 11, Microsoft is adding integration with local news “content creators and authors” front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Z9JF"&gt;In an expansion on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397237/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature-available-now"&gt;weather and news taskbar widget it recently added to Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, it not only highlights sources in your areas, but it has a payment feature built right in. As shown in the video stream, you can support people with straight cash donations or Microsoft points, and it shows how many tippers are contributing to each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qRhx3p"&gt; For creators and publishers, Widgets also opens new real estate within Windows to deliver personalized content. Our aspiration is to create a vibrant pipeline for global brands and local creators alike, in a way that both consumers and creators can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is a free upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md8bzqPuRLvwof-4yNUFKiSuVNU=/133x0:1654x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499082/eHVCZpK.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhKK7W"&gt;Microsoft officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22310832"&gt;unveiled Windows 11 today&lt;/a&gt;, and the software maker is committing to make it a free upgrade for Windows 10 users. Much like how Windows 10 was free for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, this new Windows 11 version will be free for existing Windows 10 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqPs3"&gt;All you’ll need is a PC that meets the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;minimum hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 11, which is now a 64-bit CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. Windows 11 will be delivered through Windows Update in much the same way as Windows 10 updates have been made available previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXW3qn"&gt;Windows 11 will include a new UI, with a Start menu overhaul, performance improvements, and updates to improve multitasking. It even includes access to Android apps through Amazon’s Appstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgytge"&gt;We weren’t expecting Microsoft to charge people to update to Windows 11, particularly as the company makes most of its Windows revenue through commercial and OEM licenses. Still, it’s good news for consumers with Windows 10 devices that the next version of Windows 11 will be available free of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s own Windows 11 livestream runs into technical difficulties</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1EIZ7Ii48kxHoqYrq4XcFMyPPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499040/acastro_180504_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoEjAU"&gt;Anyone trying to watch Microsoft’s Windows 11 reveal over on its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; may have noticed the stream ran into a number of technical issues, including buffering and dropouts. It got so bad that the technical adviser to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to respond, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1408080919894716416"&gt;tweeting a link&lt;/a&gt; for viewers to watch the livestream &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlNFEz72HCI"&gt;on YouTube instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y20aLS"&gt;Only the YouTube livestream wasn’t actually an official Microsoft stream at all and was technically a repost from the retailer Newegg. It just goes to show that live video is pretty damn hard, even if you’re a massive &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/microsoft-rallies-to-join-apple-in-exclusive-2-trillion-club"&gt;$2 trillion juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CgLTgZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If your video stream is failing, watch from here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y6b9tMzhIo"&gt;https://t.co/Y6b9tMzhIo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Velloso (@matvelloso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1408080919894716416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAdcNE"&gt;For our part, we’ve found that the event’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1407353538875850752"&gt;Twitter livestream&lt;/a&gt; has been pretty reliable. If you want to get your Windows 11 info from an official Microsoft source, it might be the best way to go.

    <title>Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon’s Appstore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IH2xWGd6rXPSsCbw61QfwEoxhmc=/114x0:1323x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499019/7JTO7hJ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv626q"&gt;Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11. The software giant revealed its surprise Windows 11 addition during its special Windows event today. Android apps will run natively on Windows 11 and will be downloadable from Amazon’s Appstore, via the new Windows Store that’s included in the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcNU0y"&gt;Microsoft says it’s using Amazon’s Appstore to bring Android apps to Windows 11. Apps will be listed in the new Windows store, and Microsoft is also partnering with Intel to use its Intel Bridge technology to make this a reality. Android apps on Windows 11 can be pinned to the taskbar or snapped alongside traditional Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rk7oStmbADhhHxPeYC3oMd4ag3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679105/lcimg_9abbdc71_7b16_4ba0_b22a_2e6b359bcd82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps in the Windows Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jlHuVw"&gt;Android apps on Windows 11 are an obvious answer to Apple’s progress with its M1 chips and running iOS apps on macOS. While there are many web equivalents to mobile apps, they’re often lackluster, and certain apps like Snapchat, Ring, Venmo, Roomba, and the majority of home automation apps aren’t available on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukmP1d"&gt;Microsoft demonstrated apps like TikTok running on Windows 11 today. The Windows store that Microsoft showed lists Ring, Yahoo, Uber, and others, so we’ll likely see full access to Amazon’s Appstore. It’s not immediately clear how many existing devices will support Android apps with Windows 11, as hardware will need to support Intel Bridge technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J2apmqBvj8UrUdfeSi8Iyijd_Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679133/androidappswindows.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps on PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6aob5A"&gt;This surprise announcement follows Microsoft’s original plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8511439/microsoft-windows-10-android-ios-apps-bridges"&gt;let Windows developers rework their existing Android apps&lt;/a&gt; for Windows in 2015. Project Astoria, as Microsoft labeled it, was a method to try to convince developers to port apps and make it easier to do so. The plan eventually fell apart less than a year later, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11117430/microsoft-android-apps-windows-10-port-dead"&gt;Microsoft admitting&lt;/a&gt; that having “two bridge technologies to bring code from mobile operating systems to Windows was unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWGIWZ"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/12/5404098/microsoft-considering-android-apps-on-windows"&gt;toying with the idea of running Android apps on Windows natively for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the company had been experimenting with the idea of listing Android apps in the Windows Store just ahead of the Windows 10 launch. Instead, Microsoft pushed ahead trying to convince developers to adopt its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;failed Universal Windows Platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfEhAa"&gt;Android app integration directly into Windows is a significant shift, especially as the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355997/microsoft-your-phone-app-windows-10-android-support"&gt;favoring Your Phone&lt;/a&gt; as the method to bridge the gap between Android and Windows. Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933644/microsoft-android-apps-windows-10-app-mirroring-report"&gt;embracing Android as the mobile version of Windows&lt;/a&gt; for years, and now those same mobile apps will run directly in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reveals the new Microsoft Store for Windows 11, and it has Android apps, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93ezC6rY6WG2z_xtdcwEvCGPbdc=/0x0:2448x1632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498999/microsoft_store_windows_11_luca.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atClc3"&gt;Windows 11 is real, and Microsoft has just revealed the brand-new app store that will go along with it — which could be a big deal, seeing how previous versions of the idea never really caught on. It will be called the Microsoft Store, not the Windows Store, just like it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/22/16348986/microsoft-store-windows-10-app-store"&gt;since a rebranding in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVFJXR"&gt;Here are some of the very first images of the new store, and we’re adding more screenshots and details to this post right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;While Windows 11 was thoroughly leaked in mid-June&lt;/a&gt;, that leak notably did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; include any glimpse of an updated app store, so I figure you’re eager to see how it might look!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PI9_HHzg41WVeMfG0vBhNWBzS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679148/microsoft_store_windows_11_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cb-8VPnN04kiUYepLf_UFsYZ_FM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679152/microsoft_store_windows_11_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3rbCa7oCrO9SoMrA-z-T5bQBkh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679170/microsoft_store_windows_11_4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GnficbOYmTYj7DKybCmOAfXrvkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679162/microsoft_store_windows_11_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GreMDk"&gt;The new store’s got a few partners on board: Adobe will offer its Creative Cloud suite, and Zoom will be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5iQWF"&gt;In a major move, Microsoft’s Panos Panay says developers will now be able to keep 100 percent of their revenue “if you do bring your own commerce engine” — unlike app stores from Apple and Google that generally take 30 percent of developer revenue and insist on their own payment platforms and in-app purchases. We’ll have to see if that applies to games as well, which Microsoft and other companies have generally treated separately from apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AZvJW"&gt;Another huge surprise: the new Microsoft Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;will also include Android apps&lt;/a&gt; that can run on your Windows 11 PC, thanks to a partnership with Amazon and some “Intel Bridge” technology. The Amazon Appstore will live inside the Microsoft Store, and you’ll be able to drag and pin those apps side by side traditional Windows apps on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBEZvIt4DBG4QaIZEPVUYCbN4ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679116/1067_2021_06_24_1067_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps in Windows 11’s app store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51JPQC5WJG9GBCknq6lmlQj0bsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679118/1066_2021_06_24_1066_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Android app alongside a Windows one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qqy8Dd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;We’ve known since April&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft might have been planning to overhaul its Windows app store this year, and as usual, the devil’s in the details: will it actually be open to all apps and give developers what they want and need? The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;been haunted by its original vision of a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) ever since Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;, when it architected the store explicitly to house that new breed of cross-platform app instead of the legacy Win32 programs that developers and many users tended to prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFofov"&gt;Today, Panay said whether you’re developing a UWP or traditional Windows app, the Microsoft Store is designed to be everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OSPcNh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It also tried renaming the Windows Store to the Microsoft Store, which wasn’t at all confusing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0tw4e"&gt;The company had already buried the UWP dream in 2019 with the news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;it would accept native Win32 games in its store&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s tried many other tactics to attract developers over the years — including revised policies that allow app developers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17330600/microsoft-windows-store-apps-revenue-cut-build-2018"&gt;keep 95 percent of app revenue&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;88 percent of revenue from their games&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21258697/microsoft-windows-project-reunion-win32-uwp-apps-apis-build"&gt;decouple APIs&lt;/a&gt; so Win32 apps can take advantage of modern Windows features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrCSUC"&gt;But at the end of the day, Microsoft’s app store has never made a truly convincing case for itself — to the point that the simple package manager Microsoft introduced last May &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264739/microsoft-windows-package-manager-preview-download"&gt;felt like a breath of fresh air&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Windows 11’s store will, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWECKQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap inks deal with Universal Music Group to bring major artists to the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riLsPTDc5GhtaESENwH7EA9N0rw=/0x0:2859x1906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498949/snapchatsounds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCzlSU"&gt;Snap wants people to discover and make content with music on Snapchat, and today, it secured a major deal to help it achieve that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpsS52"&gt;The company has signed a multiyear partnership with Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record label group, to bring its artists’ tracks to the platform. This means Snapchatters can search for music from various artists like Justin Bieber, The Bee Gees, Katy Perry, and others, and include them in their content, whether that be a snap they send a friend or something they submit to Spotlight — Snapchat’s TikTok rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oBHF9"&gt;Deals like this, and specifically with UMG, are critical for Snap’s future success as people discover music online and create viral content around it more frequently. TikTok, in particular, has been credited with the revival of certain songs, like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922554253/tiktok-sensation-meet-the-idaho-potato-worker-who-sent-fleetwood-mac-sales-soari"&gt;Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams,”&lt;/a&gt; as well as the popularity of newer tracks like &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/tiktok-megan-thee-stallion-year-end-2020-1104458/"&gt;Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage”&lt;/a&gt; after it became associated with a dance challenge. Snapchat needs to have as many tracks as possible on its platform to draw people to it. Then, it has to hope people will actually make viral videos. Snap says so far, 521 million videos have been created and viewed 31 billion times since the launch of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Sounds feature&lt;/a&gt;, or music catalog. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams will be directly integrated as part of Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bur3wkVILfSQa4PatR7HiRjoGwE=/161x0:1901x1160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498939/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_11.20.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k7xp1n"&gt;Microsoft Teams will be deeply woven into the upcoming Windows 11 update. During its preview of the new version of Windows, Microsoft’s Panos Panay detailed how it’ll be easier and quicker to create and join Teams meetings. The app will get prominent placement on the Windows 11 Start menu, and it’ll also be integrated throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw6nUh"&gt;Teams reached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;145 million daily active&lt;/a&gt; users back in April. The service has had occasional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405300/microsoft-teams-down-outage-worldwide-issues"&gt;stumbles and outages&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to that massive growth. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439924/microsoft-teams-personal-version-launch-available-download"&gt;launched the free consumer version&lt;/a&gt; of Teams in May. Earlier this month, the company previewed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538166/microsoft-teams-front-row-video-layout-features"&gt;new “front row” layout&lt;/a&gt; that will come to the app later this year. It’s designed to help improve hybrid work situations where some people are at the office and others are joining meetings remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVKewk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Windows 11, with a new design, Start menu, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-b4_gXOfRNtcG6UutMPHDqdWeHg=/112x0:1317x803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498859/jyOmrCq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="foYGcV"&gt;Microsoft is officially confirming the name for the next release of Windows today: Windows 11. After months of teases, hints of the number 11, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;giant Windows 11 leak&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s new operating system is official. The big focus for Windows 11 is a simplification of the Windows user interface, a new Windows Store, and improvements to performance and multitasking. Windows 11 will also include support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;running Android apps for the first time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQxdXz"&gt;The first thing you’ll notice about Windows 11 is that it includes a new Start menu and updated Start button that are both centered on the taskbar. This UI is very similar to what we first saw in Windows 10X, a project originally planned for dual-screen devices that Microsoft eventually canceled. A lot of the UI work that went into Windows 10X is appearing in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sM0HLv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10622219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4EXqY3"&gt;The new Start menu drops the Live Tiles that were originally introduced with Windows 8 and opts for more of the typical launcher you’d find in Chrome OS or Android. There are apps, recent documents, and a separate search interface. Much of the centered appearance is clearly influenced by macOS and Chrome OS, and Windows 11 also includes the rounded corners we’ve seen in both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJqiVI"&gt;Windows chief Panos Panay says “the team has obsessed over every detail.” Windows 11 will also include updated dark and light modes that look a lot better than what we’ve seen in Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLiAEeue9WyWXzgzDSn3lxsPTns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679016/lcimg_00e7c70f_af00_4756_97d7_7b7dd6726cf8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 Snap layouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i90Za9"&gt;There’s also something Microsoft is calling Snap Layouts, which allow you to quickly snap apps into the various modes that Windows 11 supports. This new version of Windows 11 will also remember where your apps are stored, thanks to something called Snap Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EpVdg"&gt;It looks like a useful way to support multiple monitors and ensure that apps always open on the correct screen. That’s particularly helpful if you’re using a laptop hooked up to a monitor or a traditional desktop machine with multiple displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70MXex"&gt;Performance is also a big focus for Windows 11. Windows updates are 40 percent smaller and more efficient as they now happen in the background. Hopefully that will mean Windows 11 doesn’t disturb you in the middle of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azO6LihkmSoBIPe7EHfK6PxaZtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679020/DrZo86L.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MkZNNW"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Microsoft Teams directly into Windows 11 for both consumers and commercial users. Teams is integrated directly into the taskbar, allowing Windows 11 users to call friends, family, or co-workers. It’s clear that this is a big shift away from Skype, which was bundled as part of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OA54Dw"&gt;Windows Widgets and touch gestures are also a big part of Windows 11. Widgets is a personalized feed, powered by AI, and it builds on the widgets we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397237/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature-available-now"&gt;Microsoft introduce in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. It slides in from the left-hand side of Windows 11, and you can also make it full-screen. Built-in widgets include a news feed, weather, and maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txWUIN"&gt;Interestingly, these widgets also include one that lets you tip local creators directly from within Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ruHt3KvlrQU6z-wTAT89k6Vk_YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679047/lcimg_b57980d8_1322_495d_9f39_6b649ad6330c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hDP0iB"&gt;Microsoft is also improving the gestures you can use on tablets and the touch targets. Instead of flipping into a tablet mode, Windows 11 simply adapts to allow you to touch the OS easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BilMnE"&gt;Coupled with this are improvements to inking and voice typing. With certain pens, Windows 11 will also support haptic feedback here. That could mean we’ll see a lot of new hardware that will support these stylus changes in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0eXiF"&gt;Xbox is a big part of Microsoft, and we also got to hear from Xbox executive Sarah Bond about PC gaming with Windows 11. Auto HDR, a feature in Xbox Series X / S, will be part of Windows 11. Enabling Auto HDR will add high dynamic range (HDR) to a large number of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games as long as you have a compatible HDR monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOhLziyz1c4FstYV8x9pPJDGwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679063/lcimg_bdfcdd14_0740_4bfb_8e42_882b1c76f79c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Xbox app in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ql9yvq"&gt;Microsoft is also promising speed and performance improvements for Windows 11. DirectStorage will be part of Windows 11, a big new feature from the Xbox Series X / S. DirectStorage will require the latest NVMe drives to speed up game load times on Windows 11, and game developers will need to enable this technology to boost load times further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N56ZW"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is also being integrated into Windows 11, thanks to a new Xbox app that the company has been testing for months. This also includes xCloud integrated into this Xbox app, so you can stream games from Microsoft’s cloud, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_oRDFOx6YrFp8nS21F21h7sneWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679230/Android_Collection_1024x683.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 app store with Android apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Sn8dK8"&gt;Finally, one of the biggest parts of Windows 11 is the new store and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;support for Android apps on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. The Microsoft Store is redesigned and will support a whole host of apps that haven’t typically been available in the Windows app store. That includes apps from Adobe Creative Suite, and Android apps including TikTok and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6n88ul"&gt;Developers can use their own “commerce engines,” and Microsoft won’t take a cut; devs can even use their own payment systems if they want to. “Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qxrWc"&gt;The biggest news here is that Windows 11 will also run Android apps. Microsoft has partnered with Amazon and Intel to make this a reality, and Windows 11 will be using Intel Bridge technology to bring this to life. Microsoft demonstrated TikTok and other Android apps running alongside Windows apps on Windows 11, and the company plans to share more information on this “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBfotu"&gt;There’s no release date for Windows 11 yet, but Microsoft has promised to make it available as a free upgrade to Windows 10 users. We’re expecting Windows 11 to appear at some point in October, alongside new hardware running the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK carrier EE introduces EU roaming charges following Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EE logo is seen at one of their stores on Oxford Street in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5DKy0Xx0tmUb4Q_KcKgy39DZOo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498687/1233588230.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Belinda Jiao/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0YM0"&gt;UK carrier EE is introducing roaming charges for customers traveling to almost all EU countries from January next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57595913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change applies to any customers who sign up or upgrade their plans after July 7th. From next year, these customers will be charged a flat fee of £2 (around $2.78) a day while in 47 “European destinations,” to get access to their plan’s existing data, minutes, and text allowances. The BT-owned carrier is also selling a 30-day Roam Abroad Pass, which is included with certain plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aJvPy"&gt;Roaming charges for UK customers visiting mainland Europe used to be commonplace until the European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;outlawed the practice in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the UK’s departure from the EU, which involved a transition period that ended on December 31st 2020, UK carriers no longer have to abide by these rules. The UK’s trade deal with the EU encourages them to have “transparent and reasonable rates” for roaming, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the charges aren’t specifically prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp67b3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fees cover 47 European destinations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16oFbv"&gt;The 47 European destinations include EU member states, plus other locations like the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, and Vatican City. Customers will not be charged an extra fee to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland, EE says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h00Zj"&gt;EE’s decision makes it the first UK carrier to introduce roaming charges post-Brexit. It’s a marked shift from what it told &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it said that its customers “enjoy inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond” and that it didn’t “have any plans to change this based on the Brexit outcome.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eqfl0"&gt;Competitors Three and O2 have also made changes to how much data their customers can use while in Europe, but have stopped short of introducing blanket charges for all usage. &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/06/clarifying-o2-uks-tougher-excess-data-charges-for-eu-roaming.html"&gt;O2 is adding a fair use cap&lt;/a&gt; of 25GB a month for users in the EU, while Three is reducing its existing cap from 20GB to 12GB, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5t4lQ"&gt;In a statement, an EE spokesperson said the charges “will support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network.” &lt;/p&gt;
