    <title>Say goodbye to your favorite podcast promo codes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Promo codes helped build an industry, now big brands are moving in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="56ikLh"&gt;Füm is the type of product that traditionally sells well through podcast ads. It’s a smoking cessation device, and when paired with a podcaster who uses it themselves, people buy. That’s why Adam McNeil, PR manager at the company, says he went from spending $3,000 per month on podcast ads at the beginning of this year to between $25,000 and $30,000 by the end. “It’s become our number one revenue source,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiJ4HT"&gt;McNeil is one of many direct response advertisers who’ve found a home in podcasting. You’re likely familiar with the others: Mailchimp, Casper, Manscaped, Tommy John, and any other that relies on promo codes. They’re synonymous with the industry. But in a year filled with indie shows going to big networks in eye-popping, multimillion-dollar deals, as well as a broader push from tech companies to make money off the space, these direct response advertisers say they’re getting priced or pushed out while the aspects they’ve come to know and love about the industry are disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YH40Y"&gt;McNeil, for example, says the cost to advertise doubled on one of his brand’s go-to shows after it was acquired — although so far, they’ve honored his prior price point. The appeal of advertising on the show has waned, however, because the hosts pack more advertisers into the same amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfUEIV"&gt;“If there’s only a few ads on the episode, it seems a little less intrusive to the listener, but all of a sudden, now there’s four, maybe five, on that episode,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxmX2C"&gt;Although the changes are often positioned as good for podcasters and the industry itself — more people are making money and attracting advertiser interest — this also comes with a compromise, the loss of the tight relationships between direct response brands and podcasters. The thing that helped make podcasting what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54iz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers say the experience of buying and distributing an ad is getting worse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q2gnt5"&gt;Another advertiser, who asked to remain anonymous over fears of straining their industry relationships, echoed McNeil. “We did have a show that we really loved working with,” they say. “It wasn’t small, but it was part of a smaller network, and everything about that felt like a true partnership. It did not feel like it was a transactional sale from a salesperson.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCK3ZX"&gt;The partnership was a “smash success” from the get-go, they say, with the team reaching their goals in half the time it typically takes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YRwhL"&gt;That all changed when that show got acquired. “I was just shocked by the difference,” they say. No longer could they switch out ad copy for a campaign that would run over three months. “If we’re not spending like half a million dollars, you don’t care if your listeners get sick of hearing our ads?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYZjb8"&gt;Plus, the show’s team previously guided them on how to create the best ad to talk to that specific audience, and the hands-on help no longer came with the amount the brand spent. Their embedded tracker wasn’t even configured correctly to determine how many people heard the ad. “It was like pulling teeth” to get everything in order to just run a successful podcast ad. The brand didn’t re-up their contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxnlHA"&gt;“I found that the larger companies are probably a lot more willing to just take your money and let you fail, or let it just happen,” McNeil adds. “The smaller networks are a lot more keen on trying to make sure that it’s a win for you, so that you renew the contract for four months, six months, a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3u1prj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ljRCTG"&gt;The issue is only becoming more pressing for both advertisers and show publishers. Acquisitions and licensing agreements occur regularly now, often with big price tags attached. This year, Amazon Music acquired &lt;em&gt;SmartLess&lt;/em&gt; in a deal reportedly worth as much as $80 million while Spotify is exclusively licensing &lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt; for a reported $60 million. Meanwhile, Vox Media, which owns &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, acquired Criminal Productions, capping off a year of acquisitions and partnerships that included Cafe Studios, &lt;em&gt;Longform&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gastropod&lt;/em&gt;. Also, SiriusXM acquired &lt;em&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/em&gt; from Roman Mars. Much of the impetus behind these deals is not only to buy reputable and far-reaching programs, but to also bulk up ad inventory. The publishers then, of course, are incentivized to make back the cash they spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ6NjT"&gt;One ad buyer, who also requested anonymity to speak freely about rates, says Spotify upped prices for its acquired and licensed shows. CPMs, or the cost per thousand listeners, on those programs are up three times as much, they say. A host-read ad that lived forever on Joe Rogan’s show used to cost tens of thousands of dollars previous to him going exclusive to Spotify. Next year, to get any ads on Rogan, the minimum spend is $1 million, they say, at a CPM upward of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi8YqD"&gt;To which Spotify spokeswoman Erin Styles says, “We believe the many innovations taking shape will benefit the entire marketplace, including creators and advertisers, and we’re confident that advertisers of all sizes will continue to find immense value in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D3NVTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An ad on Joe Rogan’s show, prior his Spotify deal, lived on an episode forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbSgqQ"&gt;Meanwhile, a separate podcaster who signed on with a big network says a buyout of their show now sells for five to 10 times more than they were charging on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQPGjb"&gt;“[Prior to all these acquisitions, advertisers] could be a mogul and be sitting on hundreds of personalities that could only advocate for [their] business, and it was performing, and it was building the brand,” says Dan Granger, founder and CEO of ad agency Oxford Road. “Then you start selling companies for $300 million with these really generous multiples, and all of a sudden, at some point, they’re going to have to show a return on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIwTTd"&gt;This leads to a world in which direct response advertisers not only lose access to the programming or treatment they once enjoyed but have to contend with bigger brands dominating the space because they can afford the more expensive ads. Magellan AI tracks the brands spending the most on podcast ads per month, and the top &lt;a href="https://www.magellan.ai/pages/top-15-podcast-advertisers-october-2021"&gt;10 list from October&lt;/a&gt; includes, yes, some brands one might expect, like HelloFresh and ZipRecruiter, but also Fortune 500 companies, like Capital One and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwOb0f"&gt;“The large brand advertisers that are advertising across television and radio and Pandora and Spotify are also looking for that type of scale that now podcasting, because it has grown so much, can provide,” says Greg Leader, SVP of advertising partnerships at SXM Media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVFPjN"&gt;These brand advertisers also often care more about putting their name into the world rather than literally selling a product, which changes the stakes of the marketing game. No more promo codes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5NbtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More brands have come to podcasting, including Fortune 500 companies with bigger budgets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9daLm"&gt;Alongside this broader change in the types of advertisers filtering into the space comes a push for, as Leader mentioned, scale, or the ability to reach lots of people quickly. To make their money back and maximize revenue, publishers are encouraging dynamic ad insertion, meaning ads aren’t baked into a program, as well as programmatic ads that aren’t inserted into specific shows necessarily but included based on audience targeting. The thing the direct response advertisers loved about the space — the baked-in, host-read ads that lived on forever as testimonials — are dissipating, at least at the space’s highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G523lY"&gt;McNeil, for example, says Füm advertises on a YouTube-distributed show and one episode reached a million views. It normally banks around 100,000. Füm paid for those 100,000 impressions, technically, but ended up with way more exposure because the ad lived on forever. “You lose that opportunity to go viral the moment you do dynamic ad insertion,” he says. Once the promised impressions are reached, an ad is swapped out for a different brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feQqWx"&gt;Which isn’t to say everyone feels for these advertisers. Maybe they had it too good, or maybe they purposely undervalued the podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9G8I5"&gt;“It’s the cycle of life,” Granger says. “You move to a cool, new neighborhood, and there’s an art gallery, and there’s some microbreweries, and there’s craftsmanship and products. Then there’s Starbucks, and then the place gets gentrified, and then everybody complains that it lost its edge. And then one day, there’s Walmart. And like, yeah, this is life. It doesn’t mean that you can’t get what you need, but if you think the street is going to be all noncorporate independent? No, the big money’s going to come, and they’re going to occupy the most real estate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="rc1kMD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drgNR5"&gt;Others think this situation is good news for podcasting as a growing, more profitable space. “I think of our industry kind of like an island being fueled by the volcano that’s underneath, adding more magma each year,” says John Goforth, CRO of Magellan AI. “The square footage is getting bigger and bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AEcQw"&gt;Multiple people I spoke with suggest the industry is merely stratifying — the top shows are going exclusive in million-plus-dollar deals, cutting off access to the protein shake makers of the world while smaller, newer podcasters stream in, hoping for the protein shake makers to buy an ad. The direct response advertisers, they say, should look in new places and for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyRmOh"&gt;“There’s always going to be somebody coming up in the world before they get picked off by Spotify,” Granger says. “And [the advertisers are] just going to have to surf on those, they’re going to have to keep riding those waves, but it’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FC0w9Z"&gt;The question is whether the advertisers who helped build are willing and able to find a place on these newer shows, or if the podcasting industry’s onward march means leaving the mattress sellers behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV warns subscribers it could lose Disney’s channels later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOVVwiqNzAvhFhq51X2-sXYFOic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268622/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyMCeF"&gt;Google has warned that YouTube TV could lose access to over a dozen Disney-owned channels later this week if it’s unable to renew its agreement with the company. In a &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV says its current deal with Disney is due to expire this Friday, December 17th, after which the channels could disappear if it’s unable to reach a new agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXJErM"&gt;“Our ask of Disney, as with all of our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider – by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them,” YouTube’s blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA6lGF"&gt;Here’s the list of impacted channels. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-channels-pulled-youtube-tv-1235061987/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that eight ABC local stations could also disappear from YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THHcx7"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n7zA2I"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pOgMmH"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UONIYH"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cFXKPu"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfvV2X"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33a4HL"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPwucW"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FRDRm2"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XS2dPN"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wBVBxJ"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E64O4W"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="afjA3W"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWZSf0"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GQmtnz"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlXfrR"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5jlW6"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jbI7jn"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Disney said that it’s “committed to working with Google to reach a fair, market-based agreement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYbHEv"&gt;“We are optimistic that we can reach a deal and continue to provide their YouTube TV customers with our live sporting events and news coverage plus kids, family and general entertainment programming,” Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2aXU8O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always want to be transparent and give you a heads-up during these active conversations. Disney is an important partner, and we’re optimistic that we can work with Disney and keep their content available on YouTube TV. For live updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5"&gt;https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube TV (@YouTubeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1470533371046416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBOTnY"&gt;If a deal can’t be reached by December 17th, YouTube TV says it will decrease its prices by $15 per month while Disney’s channels are off its service. It says that customers are free to pause or cancel their memberships at any time, and points them towards Disney’s $13.99 per month streaming bundle if they want to maintain access to “some” of Disney’s content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5mMJ1"&gt;This is just the latest high profile carriage dispute YouTube TV has been involved in this year. These have affected both the company’s deals to offer streaming content from other companies, as well as its agreements with hardware providers to host YouTube’s apps. Less than three months ago the service was just days away from losing access to NBCUniversal’s channels before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;reaching an agreement in early October&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this month it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;reached an agreement with Roku&lt;/a&gt; for it to continue carrying YouTube’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Algorithms that detect cancer can be fooled by hacked images</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPSxTf8AYgc-qpzKofU6Hg-4h2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268556/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMCKpD"&gt;Artificial intelligence programs that check medical images for evidence of cancer can be duped by hacks and cyberattacks, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27577-x"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers demonstrated that a computer program could add or remove evidence of cancer from mammograms, and  those changes fooled both an AI tool and human radiologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6YA3q"&gt;That could lead to an incorrect diagnosis. An AI program helping to screen mammograms might say a scan is healthy when there are actually signs of cancer or incorrectly say that a patient does have cancer when they’re actually cancer free. Such hacks are not known to have happened in the real world yet, but the new study adds to a growing body of research suggesting healthcare organizations need to be prepared for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRgHcA"&gt;Hackers are increasingly targeting hospitals and healthcare institutions with cyberattacks. Most of the time, those attacks siphon off patient data (which is valuable on the black market) or lock up an organization’s computer systems until that organizations pays a ransom. Both of those types of attacks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;can harm patients&lt;/a&gt; by gumming up the operations at a hospital and making it harder for healthcare workers to deliver good care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPJaGV"&gt;But experts are also growing more worried about the potential for more direct attacks on people’s health. Security researchers have shown that hackers can remotely &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;break into internet-connected insulin pumps&lt;/a&gt; and deliver dangerous doses of the medication, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvqNnf"&gt;Hacks that can change medical images and impact a diagnosis also fall into that category. In the new study on mammograms, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a research team from the University of Pittsburgh designed a computer program that would make the X-ray scans of breasts that originally appeared to have no signs of cancer look like they were cancerous, and that would make mammograms that look cancerous appear to have no signs of cancer. They then fed the tampered images to an artificial intelligence program trained to spot signs of breast cancer and asked five human radiologists to decide if the images were real or fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGofOt"&gt;Around 70 percent of the manipulated images fooled that program — that is, the AI wrongly said that images manipulated to look cancer-free were cancer-free, and that the images manipulated to look like they had cancer did have evidence of cancer. As for the radiologists, some were better at spotting manipulated images than others. Their accuracy at picking out the fake images ranged widely, from 29 percent to 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSnuGZ"&gt;Other studies have also demonstrated the possibility that a cyberattack on medical images could lead to incorrect diagnoses. In 2019, a team of cybersecurity researchers &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-mirsky_0.pdf"&gt;showed that hackers&lt;/a&gt; could add or remove evidence of lung cancer from CT scans. Those changes also fooled both human radiologists and artificial intelligence programs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0tK4q"&gt;There &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164850/"&gt;haven’t been&lt;/a&gt; public or high-profile cases where a hack like this has happened. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-mirsky_0.pdf"&gt;a few reasons&lt;/a&gt; a hacker might want to manipulate things like mammograms or lung cancer scans. A hacker might be interested in targeting a specific patient, like a political figure, or they might want to alter their own scans to get money from their insurance company or sign up for disability payments. Hackers might also manipulate images randomly and refuse to stop tampering with them until a hospital pays a ransom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WURnlj"&gt;Whatever the reason, demonstrations like this one show that healthcare organizations and people designing AI models should be aware that hacks that alter medical scans are a possibility. Models should be shown manipulated images during their training to teach them to spot fake ones, study author Shandong Wu, associate professor of radiology, biomedical informatics, and bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a statement. Radiologists might also need to be trained to identify fake images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO965V"&gt;“We hope that this research gets people thinking about medical AI model safety and what we can do to defend against potential attacks,” Wu said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deplatforming Trump didn’t work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump Holds Rally At Iowa State Fairgrounds" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vu9rG39WkY1g3o7Q9D7Rseneb5M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268459/1345757982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ex-president is as powerful as ever, and democratic erosion is accelerating&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="DzO8wC"&gt;Today, as the year winds down, let’s talk about what we learned in 2021 about the relationship between tech and democracy — and about where the most urgent questions lie as we head into 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4PLgo"&gt;In the years that Donald Trump served as president, platforms faced frequent calls to remove his accounts. From his primary posting station on Twitter, Trump had among other things spread lies about COVID, incited harassment against average citizens, and threatened nuclear war. After losing re-election to Joe Biden, he lied relentlessly about the outcome, undermining faith in democracy and ultimately inciting the January 6th attacks on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZrdAi"&gt;Because he was president, he was allowed to keep his accounts through January 6th. But after Congress certified Biden’s victory — and Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on his behalf — platforms suspended his accounts indefinitely. To tech determinists, who believe that social networks uniquely enabled Trump’s rise and were among the primary sources of his power, the past 11 months offered us an imperfect test of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFAmHu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;his power has arguably only increased&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOhNvO"&gt;If you believe social networks were a primary source of Trump’s power, it follows that removing him from those networks would lessen that power. And yet in nearly a year since Trump was removed from those networks, his power has arguably only increased. After&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/trump-deplatforms-himself"&gt; an aborted effort to start a blog this summer&lt;/a&gt;, he has settled into a routine of sending out tweet-like press releases to supporters and press outlets, many of which still find their way into the Twitter timeline and the news cycle. He makes frequent cable TV appearances, and recently held a rally in Iowa. A SPAC deal, which has promised to create some sort of Trump-centric media company and social network, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-13/the-trump-spac-pipe-is-free-money?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;is also now underway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t75VQd"&gt;More importantly than all that, though, Trump has served as promoter-in-chief for a national campaign to rewrite election laws in his favor, while installing supporters in key positions that could enable him to successfully overturn an election loss in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLr8vC"&gt;Removing Trump from Twitter and other platforms surely spared us a year’s worth of lies and incitements to violence; it was and remains the right thing to do. But in a larger sense, it’s clear that deplatforming Trump did little to improve the underlying political situation in this country. It seems that situation is getting worse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt3kEV"&gt;In a truly chilling cover story for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/"&gt;Barton Gellman describes January 6th as a rehearsal for what is to come.&lt;/a&gt; (If you abandon today’s edition now and just go read that story in its entirety instead, it won’t hurt my feelings.) Two themes from the piece stand out: one, the way Trump critics are being systematically purged within the Republican party, leaving only the feeblest resistance behind; and two, how small a role tech in general or social networks specifically seem to play in any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANll81"&gt;To be sure, there are hints of it in the story: a Facebook live stream here, a Telegram message there. A retired firefighter who believes the 2020 election was stolen, or says he does, serves as a proxy in the story for Trump’s base — and the firefighter gets most of his misinformation from the right-wing media ecosystem, which has thrived on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PHFhts"&gt;&lt;q&gt;21 million Americans could plausibly be described as “committed insurrectionists.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdfnI2"&gt;But this is not a story about algorithms polarizing us via engagement-based ranking, or about demagogues recruiting followers via the suggested user list. Instead, to Gellman at least, it’s about something much older, and uglier: that reliable predictor of genocide, fears of a “Great Replacement.” As changing demographics predict a white minority in the United States by 2045, many white Republicans are desperate to cement their power — using violence if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPtJq1"&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; story, a group called the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, or CPOST, ran national opinion surveys to gauge the attitudes of people who say they do not trust the 2020 election results. They found that perhaps 21 million Americans could plausibly be described as “committed insurrectionists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgcKru"&gt;Drawing connections to Slobodan Milošević’s Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and Northern Ireland in the 1960s, Gellman writes of Americans today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3XD99o"&gt;The committed insurrectionists, Pape judged, were genuinely dangerous. There were not many militia members among them, but more than one in four said the country needed groups like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. One-third of them owned guns, and 15 percent had served in the military. All had easy access to the organizing power of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29k0od"&gt;What Pape was seeing in these results did not fit the government model of lone wolves and small groups of extremists. “This really is a new, politically violent mass movement,” he told me. “This is collective political violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rdMWtL"&gt;As recently as 2017, it still seemed at least possible that we might buttress some elements of our democracy at the level of the social network: that if we caught and removed Russian agents, stopped recommending extremist organizations, and eliminated all the misinformation and disinformation we could find, a kind of balance might be restored. Four years on, it’s now clear that while those steps were necessary, they were not sufficient, and the country is moving inexorably toward a constitutional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP1vf3"&gt;It’s also clear that the determinist case for tech reform was mostly wishful thinking. On one hand, platforms have regularly been found to be complicit in spreading hate speech that leads to real-world violence, most famously in Myanmar and India. And even in the United States, where platforms devote an outsized percentage of their moderation resources, a violent movement like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/20/21375381/facebook-qanon-purge-content-policy-tide-pods"&gt;QAnon was allowed to flower for years&lt;/a&gt; before they finally cracked down in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XTyln"&gt;But reading Gellman’s story, or what is effectively a companion piece in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/interactive/2021/january-6-next-coup-signs/"&gt;the next 18 steps to look for in our coming democratic erosion&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes clear how much bigger our emergency is than all of that. The platforms have their role to play, but it’s smaller than I had assumed. Which is unfortunate, because the past five years have shown that tech companies &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be cajoled into addressing at least some of the harms that take place on their watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRh94T"&gt;Which is more than I can say for Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peCZrT"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; over the weekend, Cecelia Kang examined the fruits of American lawmakers’ five-year-old reckoning over the size, power, and influence of our biggest companies. She finds a slew of hearings, a pack of confused congressmen and viral gaffes, and a blank space where their long-promised tech reforms should be. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/11/business/congress-tech-regulation.html"&gt;Kang writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X6Wcre"&gt;The lack of regulation of technology companies is not because elected officials don’t understand the internet. That used to be the case, and it helps explain why they have been so slow with oversight measures. Now, though, new questions about technology get mapped onto increasingly intractable political divides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idfcjf"&gt;Without the distractions of bizarre questions, what’s left is the naked reality that the parties are deeply at odds over how to protect consumers and encourage businesses. Dozens of bills to strengthen privacy, encourage competition and quell misinformation have stalled because of a basic disagreement over the hand of government on businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nhP5y2"&gt;This is profoundly true. And yet, in the context of democratic erosion, it can also feel so quaint as to be essentially beside the point. One of America’s two major political parties is undertaking a concerted effort to eliminate the role of voters in choosing their elected officials. And we’re surprised that these two sides can’t agree on how to govern &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZOIP0"&gt;It’s a shame, of course, because there is so much regulation to be done. There are even, here and there, good ideas: I love &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-want-social-media-apps-to-share-research-11639044001?st=6517ctjjj2y6ab2&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"&gt;this new bill&lt;/a&gt; from Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE), Rob Portman (R-OH) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), which would require platforms like Facebook to share data with independent researchers. Other worthy bills would require disclosures around content moderation and political advertising, or restrain anticompetitive business practices. All of these reforms could be enacted without infringing on companies’ speech rights, the tripwire that has doomed so many efforts to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to2qWK"&gt;But as this year comes to a close, I find it necessary to restore some sense of proportion to the subjects that we cover around here. The present and future state of platforms will always be the core subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platformer"&gt;Platformer&lt;/a&gt;. But so many assumptions about that future rely on the notion that those platforms will be built inside a stable democracy, and within a few years that may well not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY76E6"&gt;Americans did their part: the majority voted to preserve their democracy, and gave to Democrats the presidency and both houses of Congress. But the margins are narrow, our governance system is old and brittle, and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrA3eO"&gt;All of this has been said before, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/democrats-senate-reconciliation.html"&gt;often much better&lt;/a&gt;, by people who make politics their full-time beat. I would love nothing more than to join the rest of Silicon Valley in full-time contemplation of Web3, the metaverse, and anything else that might distract me from the potential of life under permanent minority rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrEDG"&gt;But the future of tech and the future of democracy are inextricably linked. Biden’s victory last year offered some hope that Congress would be able to make progress on both subjects. As we approach next year’s midterm elections, though, there is distressingly little progress to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5vcztd"&gt;For five years now we have listened to lawmakers lecture the tech industry about its many failures. But effective platform governance will only ever take us so far. And if it can’t protect our democracy at this crucial moment, starting &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/crucial-boost-john-lewis-voting-rights-advancement-act"&gt;by passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act&lt;/a&gt;, the most catastrophic failure of all will be that of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google staffs up to build OS for unknown ‘innovative AR device’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXC5mLERh75gLOd8LErMkrGu2Do=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268422/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9frQMG"&gt;Google is hiring an “Augmented Reality OS” team focused on building software for an “innovative AR device,” according to job listings &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/13/google-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team is led by Mark Lucovsky, who announced he’d &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921"&gt;joined the company this week&lt;/a&gt;. Lucovsky previously worked at Meta developing an in-house alternative to Android to power the company’s hardware, and also co-authored the Windows NT operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvN979"&gt;According to Google’s job listings, the Augmented Reality OS team is building “the software components that control and manage the hardware on [its] Augmented Reality (AR) products.” This is far from Google’s first stab at developing AR software, and follows the company’s work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219696/google-arcore-augmented-reality-platform-announce-release-pixel-samsung"&gt;ARCore for Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11895368/google-project-tango-name-change-ar-atap"&gt;Tango&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s Google Glass, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGlass%20Enterprise%20Edition,developing%20for%20Glass.%E2%80%9D"&gt;aimed at the business and enterprise market&lt;/a&gt;, is currently built on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0REbMj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I became a Noogler. My role is to lead the Operating System team for Augmented Reality at Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in joining me on this journey, I'd love to talk. Here is a link to one of the many positions I'm working to fill: &lt;a href="https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD"&gt;https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hVAVKcZvQJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hVAVKcZvQJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— mark lucovsky (@marklucovsky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GevAyQ"&gt;“We’re focused on making immersive computing accessible to many people through mobile devices,” reads &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/98805776622985926-senior-software-engineer-embedded-systems-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;one job listing&lt;/a&gt; for a senior software engineer on the team, adding that they’ll be responsible for helping “create compelling AR experiences on highly-customized hardware platforms.” There are other listings for developers focused on camera and input hardware, and some that mention “real-time operating system (RTOS) development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93CXph"&gt;While most of the positions are based in the US, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that some are based in Waterloo, Canada. It’s here that North, the augmented reality company behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18223593/focals-smart-glasses-north-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Focals smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;Google acquired last year&lt;/a&gt;, is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq17fc"&gt;Between that acquisition and these open job positions, it looks like Google is increasingly serious about developing and releasing more AR hardware. The renewed interest can’t come soon enough, with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rumored to be releasing a mixed-reality headset&lt;/a&gt; of its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;as early as next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma7cgx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAY9QK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Air Glass ‘assisted reality’ device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUTMMFUjNxNB3mfUvNkzsXAGqaY=/47x0:1874x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268392/3._OPPO_Air_Glass_Weather_Notification.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2OECP5"&gt;Oppo has announced the Air Glass, an AR device that’ll go on sale early next year. Oppo describes the Air Glass as an “assisted reality” product, as opposed to augmented reality, meaning it projects 2D information into your field of view rather than overlaying 3D objects onto the real world. (Yes, sort of like Google Glass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZB2rG"&gt;The Air Glass has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor and weighs just 30g (about 1oz) in total. Oppo says it should last for 3 hours of active usage and 40 hours on standby. There are two frame designs, a silver half-frame and a black full-frame, and each is available in two sizes. The inside of the frame has a magnetic port that allows it to be attached to more conventional glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzzcU6"&gt;The waveguide display uses a tiny projector with Micro LED tech capable of up to 3 million nits peak brightness, though Oppo says the actual brightness will be up to 1,400 nits in average conditions. It can be operated via touch, voice, hand tracking, and head tracking, as well as through a Smart Glass app on a smartphone running Oppo’s ColorOS 11 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lC-mTEjw8u4q7kiM-3yEWhgA6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086596/4._OPPO_Air_Glass_Teleprompter.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQK7P"&gt;Oppo’s proposed use cases for the Air Glass are relatively modest. The company says it can be used for notifications and directions, as you’d expect, as well as features like teleprompting and real-time translation. The display is monochrome with either 16 or 256 levels of grayscale depending on the mode, so the Air Glass isn’t going to be beaming rich content into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nrgz"&gt;That said, it probably isn’t going to be a mature, mainstream product, either. Oppo says the Air Glass will receive a “limited release” in Q1 2022, and at least at first it’ll be only sold in mainland China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkNTm1"&gt;The Air Glass was announced as part of Oppo’s ongoing annual Inno Day event. Oppo also revealed its first in-house NPU chip to boost machine learning-related imaging performance; it’s called the MariSilicon X and will feature in Oppo’s next Find X flagship in the first quarter of next year. Last week Oppo confirmed the debut of its first folding phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;the Find N&lt;/a&gt;, though that hasn’t broken cover just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike just bought a virtual shoe company that makes NFTs and sneakers ‘for the metaverse’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RTFKT made these A16Z sneakers to celebrate a round of venture capital funding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdS8bBhL_SCJR28JpM0BInoHx0o=/103x0:1897x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267765/a16z_rtfkt_sneakers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;RTFKT made these A16Z sneakers to celebrate a round of venture capital funding | Image: RTFKT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yzEOPC"&gt;One comparison I’ve heard repeatedly over the last year is that buying NFTs to “flex” on people in the metaverse is just like collecting sneakers, and now Nike is apparently trying to make sure it’s ready for the literal version of that possibility. The apparel giant &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nike.com%2Fnews%2Fnike-acquires-rtfkt&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22833369%2Fnike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just announced the acquisition of RTFKT Studios&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls “a leading brand that leverages cutting edge innovation to deliver next generation collectibles that merge culture and gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG96Rb"&gt;RTFKT claims that in February, a collaboration with teenage artist FEWOCiOUS to sell real sneakers paired with virtual ones &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzsM1epvFH/"&gt;managed to sell some 600 pairs/NFTs in just six minutes&lt;/a&gt;, netting over $3.1 million at the time. This was around the same early spring period when most of us were hearing about NFTs for the first time, as Grimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;sold some $6 million worth of digital artwork on March 1st&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear if any of these digital items are worth as much now; looking at &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fewocious-x-rtfkt"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/marketplace?artistId=44586&amp;amp;collection=0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103&amp;amp;niftyType=8&amp;amp;sortBy=recent"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; right now, I see a number of them are either listed for or have recently sold for less than their original prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IcfPEE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RTFKT is now a part of the NIKE, Inc. family.   ‍  &lt;a href="https://t.co/5egNk9d8wA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5egNk9d8wA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— RTFKT Studios (@RTFKTstudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios/status/1470502799498792963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5VYNa"&gt;But forget the past — and that time it photoshopped a pair of its sneakers onto Elon Musk — RTFKT is moving forward, and just yesterday the A16Z-backed startup launched the Clone X NFT collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, offering up a number of metaverse-ready digital avatars styled with various collectible traits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="d8XGpB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6kp9X"&gt;The company’s website immediately asks visitors to link their Metamask wallets, which is one of the ways NFT owners can verify their purchases, with the idea that at some point in the future you’ll play games or enter other sorts of VR spaces where your items can materialize, once those spaces have read the blockchain to assess which items you own the rights to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbWydT"&gt;This is the kind of vision that Nike is buying into, crediting the company’s founder Benoit Pagotto, Chris Le, and Steven Vasilev with leveraging “the latest in game engines, NFTs, blockchain authentication and augmented reality to create one of a kind virtual products and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzT_X4EWOMd3u0EYEvfWABzrO7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086140/logo_lockup_original.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6EZ8Vi"&gt;While announcing the deal — without revealing how much it spent — Nike positioned RTFKT’s lightning bolt-style logo alongside its own iconic swoosh, Jumpman, and Converse marks. Those brands have decades of history, built on high-level athletic endorsements, distinctive designs, and a grassroots culture that actually exists in the real world. RTFKT, meanwhile, was founded in January 2020. It &lt;a href="https://rtfkt.com/aboutus"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; “the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t buy a monitor or TV just for HDMI 2.1 — read the fine print or you might get fooled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HDMI cable shutterstock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NoiLrld_4soWZm9maUZYdOLPLwk=/0x2:1000x669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267757/shutterstock_123837283.1419979871.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HDMI cable shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UZ1BE5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/6/14189066/hdmi-2-1-specification-8k-10k-vrr"&gt;Four years running&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve been jazzed by the potential of HDMI 2.1 — the relatively new video connector standard that can provide variable refresh rates (VRR), automatic low latency connections (ALLM), and of course, a giant pipe with 48Gbps of bandwidth (and fixed rate signaling) to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/28/16710568/hdmi-new-specification-10k-resolution-future-proof-standard"&gt;up to 10K resolution&lt;/a&gt; and up to a 120Hz refresh rate depending on your cable and compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9jw5i"&gt;But today, I’m learning that &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; are all of those features technically optional, but that the HDMI standards body owner &lt;em&gt;actually encourages&lt;/em&gt; TV and monitor manufacturers that have none of those things — zip, zilch, zero — to effectively lie and call them “HDMI 2.1” anyhow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHPdwo"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/when-hdmi-2-1-isnt-hdmi-2-1"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which confronted the HDMI Licensing Administrator with the news that Xiaomi was selling an “HDMI 2.1” monitor that supported no HDMI 2.1 features, and was told this was a perfectly reasonable state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlrNop"&gt;It’s infuriating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Me9HM0"&gt;It means countless people, some of whom we’ve encouraged in our reviews to seek out HDMI 2.1 products, may get fooled into fake futureproofing if they don’t look at the fine print to see whether features like ALLM, VRR, or even high refresh rates are possible. Worse, they’ll get fooled for no particularly good reason: there was a perfectly good version of HDMI without those features called HDMI 2.0, but the HDMI Licensing Administrator decided to kill off that brand when it introduced the new one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQsPABErI_3fOzdaoVOa5nebE_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086035/featuresupport.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See all those “Yes” in the rightmost column? They should read “Maybe”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jy6VwA"&gt;Very little of this is actually news, I’m seeing — &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1606135005"&gt;we technically should have known that HDMI 2.1’s marquee features would be optional&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, and here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; we’ve seen many a TV ship without full support. In one story about shopping for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;the best gaming TV for PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, we characterized it as “early growing pains.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNPCFm"&gt;But now it’s looking like those pains might have just been the start — now that Xiaomi has dipped a toe into murky waters and the HDMI powers-that-be have expressed their support. We confirmed with the HDMI Licensing Administrator that, in fact, Xiaomi is actually doing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing as far as it’s concerned. “Devices can no longer be certified for 2.0,” writes HDMI.org spokesperson Douglas Wright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ADO75T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are all dependent on manufacturers and resellers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vD3MAX"&gt;“Does HDMI have any comment about the consumer confusion that would likely lead to?” I ask via email. “We are all dependent on manufacturers and resellers correctly stating which features their devices support,” Wright adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0UOuC"&gt;Do you trust your manufacturer or reseller, who fundamentally try to upsell you as often as they can? Or do you think maybe, say, &lt;em&gt;the standards body &lt;/em&gt;should be responsible for making a label that actually means something instead of helping or even pushing companies to mislead you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkg0YC"&gt;“What about USB?” you might ask. Yep, we’ve been similarly annoyed by USB-C branding, where a single cable &lt;em&gt;could theoretically&lt;/em&gt; let you charge your laptop, transfer up to 20Gbps of data, hook up multiple monitors and even connect to an external graphics card, but might &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do none of the above. We’ve seen some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;similar branding shenanigans&lt;/a&gt; from USB, too — like when the USB Implementer’s Forum decided to make USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 suddenly look way better at retail by calling them “USB 3.2 Gen 1” and “USB 3.2 Gen 2”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J320Jh"&gt;But usually, I get the feeling that the USB-IF is at least &lt;em&gt;trying &lt;/em&gt;to allay consumer confusion with new sets of logos and names, even if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard"&gt;winds up making far too many of them for them to be remotely practical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXPgqY"&gt;As someone who has twice helped family members understand that the number of megapixels has nothing to do with the processing speed of your phone, this sucks. And that’s before we even consider that buying cables for these devices is also a bit of a shitshow, with very little guarantee that you’ll get a quality HDMI or USB-C cable that can actually offer enough bandwidth (and in the case of USB-PD, enough wattage) to power all the features even if your TV, monitor, and laptop offer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjHHr0"&gt;Please do better, standards bodies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG made a battery-powered TV that you can wheel around on a stand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3YmNAu4Cw7WAaZGXSAAkReak-Q=/0x0:1977x1318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267629/LG_StanbyME_Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBexnm"&gt;CES 2022 is only a few short weeks away, and you can bet we’ll see a ton of news surrounding the latest, flashiest TVs with OLED, Mini LED, MicroLED, and more. But before we get there, LG is making an early announcement to put a spotlight on two unconventional TVs that are coming next year in addition to whatever the company has in store for CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJvCmz"&gt;To me, the standout is the LG StanbyME, a 27-inch TV that can operate wirelessly on battery power and be wheeled around on its height-adjustable stand. (You can also detach the screen from the stand if you want to plop that sucker onto your lap.) When attached to the stand, the display can swivel, tilt, or be rotated to portrait orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFLRPL1m3WipfkEQmQkxzaco4vE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084681/LG_StanbyME_Living_Room.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stand has concealed wheels for easy movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Rgap"&gt;LG says the StanbyME can last for up to three hours on a charge, so while it’ll handle a movie or two without issue, you’ll have to be mindful of runtimes and keep it plugged in for &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; marathons. LG doesn’t make 27-inch OLED panels, so we’re looking at an LCD screen here. The company isn’t yet sharing details on its resolution or other features like HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPk6ImFQcybA8jAvVy488xSKr1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084689/LG_StanbyME_Patio.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who cares if the display is only 27 inches when you can watch it on a hammock?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wHFzNK"&gt;The StanbyME has a touchscreen interface and will offer streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube. It will also support NFC for smartphone mirroring. As for connectivity, there’s a USB port and at least one HDMI input. And the back of the set has a fabric finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SpxLt"&gt;LG is also tonight announcing the Objet, a high-design OLED TV that’s meant to be leaned against a wall instead of mounted or put on a traditional stand. The fabric cover under the 65-inch screen can be raised or lowered with the remote. According to LG, it’s interchangeable and will come in three colors that are all the work of “Danish textile innovator, Kvadrat.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROSZpXEiyo5nRxsUxNaALG_gbH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085640/LG_Objet_TV_65Art90_Angle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Object is designed to be leaned against the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PwQjqi"&gt;Similar to the ultra-luxury rollable OLED, this gives the TV different modes including Full View, which is self-explanatory, and Line View, which shows widgets like the weather and music when part of the display is covered by the stylish fabric. The Objet feels like an attempt from LG to further take on Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs like The Frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKGMXD3bCwgEa6Ur8RfmdoiojpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085645/LG_Objet_TV_65Art90_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fabric cover can slide up so that only a small area of the display is shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SjhRuj"&gt;The Objet uses an OLED Evo panel, which first debuted in 2021’s G1 Series and offers higher peak brightness than LG’s older OLEDs. As for audio, there’s a 80-watt, 4.2-channel sound system built into the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2juoXb"&gt;LG isn’t announcing pricing or release details for either the StanbyME or Objet right now; we should hear more about them when they’re available to stand around in homes in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It seems even Apple’s Eddy Cue can’t find an Xbox without Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Allen &amp;amp;amp; Company Sun Valley Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sWFywH5tBMJXy4KWTF3Xf80TvY=/0x0:4416x2944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267619/996307784.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w2ZUar"&gt;More than a year after their release, the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles are still very difficult to find — and it seems that even Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, is looking for some tips on Twitter on how to snag one of the elusive consoles. According to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert/status/1470544825212669953"&gt;Big Tech Alert Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, he followed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxStockAlerts"&gt;@XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;, an account that posts about Xbox console restocks, on Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hschjZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cue&lt;/a&gt; (SVP Internet Services &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;) is now following &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxStockAlerts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Big Tech Alert (@BigTechAlert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert/status/1470544825212669953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0dV5Y9"&gt;There could be any number of reasons why he decided to follow the account. The simplest is that he wants to get a new Xbox; maybe he’s looking to give one as a holiday gift, or perhaps he wants to jump into &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer now that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829744/halo-infinite-playlists-slayer"&gt;dedicated Slayer playlist is being added to the game&lt;/a&gt;. (Eddy, if you want to play &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; sometime, let me know.) It’s also possible he’s just doing some market research — maybe he wants to see how dire the console shortage really is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH5586"&gt;That said, I do find this follow quite funny. Cue, as a very senior Apple executive, presumably has contacts or the means to scrounge up an Xbox Series X without the need to rely on a Twitter account. But maybe things are bad enough that he really does have to use this account to procure a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; machine for the holidays. (After all, playing big Xbox- exclusive games on an iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;isn’t as easy as it could have been&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
