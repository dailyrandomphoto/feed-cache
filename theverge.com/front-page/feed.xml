    <title>Adobe has built a deepfake tool, but it doesn’t know what to do with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTXwQje8slFqVVzh2pzQ5HU2htU=/92x0:1913x1214/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052462/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_4.32.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBTvnd"&gt;Deepfakes have made a huge impact on the world of image, audio, and video editing, so why isn’t Adobe, corporate behemoth of the content world, getting more involved? Well, the short answer is that it is — but slowly and carefully. At the company’s annual Max conference today, it unveiled a prototype tool named Project Morpheus that demonstrates both the potential and problems of integrating deepfake techniques into its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmcvWE"&gt;Project Morpheus is basically a video version of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21517616/adobe-photoshop-ai-neural-filters-beta-launch-machine-learning"&gt;Neural Filters&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in Photoshop last year. These filters use machine learning to adjust a subject’s appearance, tweaking things like their age, hair color, and facial expression (to change a look of surprise into one of anger, for example). Morpheus brings all those same adjustments to video content while adding a few new filters, like the ability to change facial hair and glasses. Think of it as a character creation screen for humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cz72Z1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Project Morpheus is a deepfake tool, though Adobe won’t call it that&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1vp9z"&gt;The results are definitely not flawless and are very limited in scope in relation to the wider world of deepfakes. You can only make small, pre-ordained tweaks to the appearance of people facing the camera, and can’t do things like face swaps, for example. But the quality will improve fast, and while the feature is just a prototype for now with no guarantee it will appear in Adobe software, it’s clearly something the company is investigating seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lZwRU"&gt;What Project Morpheus also is, though, is a deepfake tool — which is potentially a problem. A big one. Because deepfakes and all that’s associated with them — from nonconsensual pornography to political propaganda — aren’t exactly good for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bjmx2A"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bpABm6XcRMw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ0Unj"&gt;Now, given the looseness with which we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17380306/deepfake-definition-ai-manipulation-fake-news"&gt;define deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; these days, Adobe has arguably been making such tools for years. These include the aforementioned Neural Filters, as well as more functional tools like AI-assisted masking and segmentation. But Project Morpheus is obviously much more &lt;em&gt;deepfakey&lt;/em&gt; than the company’s earlier efforts. It’s all about editing video footage of humans — in ways that many will likely find uncanny or manipulative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDWZtg"&gt;Changing someone’s facial expression in a video, for example, might be used by a director to punch up a bad take, but it could also be used to create political propaganda — e.g. making a jailed dissident appear relaxed in court footage when they’re really being starved to death. It’s what policy wonks refer to as a “dual-use technology,” which is a snappy way of saying that the tech is “sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPmQu"&gt;This, no doubt, is why Adobe didn’t once use the word “deepfake” to describe the technology in any of the briefing materials it sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And when we asked why this was, the company didn’t answer directly but instead gave a long answer about how seriously it takes the threats posed by deepfakes and what it’s doing about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZLYR6"&gt;Adobe’s efforts in these areas seem involved and sincere (they’re mostly focused on &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/adobe-expands-content-authenticity-initiative-tools-to-fight-misinformation-26696717/"&gt;content authentication schemes&lt;/a&gt;), but they don’t mitigate a commercial problem facing the company: that the same deepfake tools that would be most useful to its customer base are those that are also potentially most destructive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ItBMMF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Deepfakes present a tricky problem for Adobe’s business strategy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdPYlm"&gt;Take, for example, the ability to paste someone’s face onto someone else’s body — arguably the ur-deepfake application that started all this bother. You might want such a face swap for legitimate reasons, like licensing Bruce Willis’ likeness for a &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/bruce-willis-licensed-his-deepfake-for-a-series-of-russian-mobile-carrier-ads"&gt;series of mobile ads in Russia&lt;/a&gt;). But you might also be creating nonconsensual pornography to harass, intimidate, or blackmail someone (by far the most common malicious application of this technology). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4ByKp"&gt;Regardless of your intent, if you want to create this sort of deepfake, you have plenty of options, none of which come from Adobe. You can hire a boutique deepfake content studio, wrangle with some open-source software, or, if you don’t mind your face swaps being limited to preapproved memes and gifs, you can download an app. What you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do is fire up Adobe Premiere or After Effects. So will that change in the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvcGTt"&gt;It’s impossible to say for sure, but I think it’s definitely a possibility. After all, Adobe survived the advent of “Photoshopped” becoming shorthand for digitally edited images in general, and often with negative connotations. And for better or worse, deepfakes are slowly losing their own negative associations as they’re adopted in more mainstream projects. Project Morpheus is a deepfake tool with some serious guardrails (you can only make prescribed changes and there’s no face-swapping, for example), but it shows that Adobe is determined to explore this territory, presumably while gauging reactions from the industry and public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RKFkt"&gt;It’s fitting that as “deepfake” has replaced “Photoshopped” as the go-to accusation of fakery  in the public sphere, Adobe is perhaps feeling left out. Project Morpheus suggests it may well catch up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips usher in a new generation of x86 processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2HJTvONFOxRjwzprQSNLSKuMUY=/0x1:1925x1284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052373/i9_Gaming_Desktop___Box_Shot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VphOEM"&gt;Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have finally arrived, ushering in a new era of the company’s chips, lead by the flagship Core i9-12900K CPU, which Intel promises is the “world’s best gaming processor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfKO7Q"&gt;The company has been teasing Alder Lake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;since CES 2021 in January&lt;/a&gt;, and it revealed a lot more details on the specifics of its hybrid architecture approach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631059/intel-alder-lake-chip-hybrid-architecture-day-2021-desktop-laptop-preview-cores"&gt;at its 2021 Architecture Day in July&lt;/a&gt;. But today’s announcement marks the culmination of those efforts in the form of actual hardware that you can buy and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rt8twX"&gt;Intel is kicking things off with three new chips, led by the Core i9-12900K model, which offers a total of 16 cores (split between eight performance forced “P-cores” and eight efficient “E-cores”) and 24 threads and is capable of reaching clock speeds of up to 5.2GHz using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. All told, Intel promises a 19 percent performance improvement thanks to the new P-core architecture compared to its 11th Gen chips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fU2jjRw8qi7ax84cOW3a1-fcytk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957885/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgXt4g"&gt;There’s also the Core i7-12700K (12 total cores and 20 threads, with eight P-cores and four E-cores) and the Core i5-12700K (10 total cores and 16 threads, with six P-cores and four E-cores) for those who don’t need as much firepower. Each of the three new chips are also available in a KF variant that ditches the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 770 to shave a few bucks off the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5MuOM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10830140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jm3QRu"&gt;Intel is also using the new chips to introduce a lot of future-facing support for more advanced standards. All three new chips offer up to 20 PCIe lanes (split between 16 PCIe 5.0 and 4 PCIe 4.0 lanes), support for DDR5 memory at up to 4800MT/s (along with older DDR4 support at 3200MT/s), and larger L3 and L2 cache sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2BHG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s new chips look to the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zppz6T"&gt;Unfortunately, with new chips comes the need for a new motherboard: Alder Lake will need a motherboard built on Intel’s newly announced Z690 chipset, which adds more modern conveniences like Wi-Fi 6E support and faster USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 data transfer. Intel is using a new LGA 1700 socket here, so you may even need a new cooler or slightly updated standoffs from the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXM052"&gt;Intel is also heavily pushing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; as a key part of its Alder Lake lineup, noting that it’s worked with Microsoft to optimize its Intel Thread Director software to better manage tasks across threads when using the new OS. We’ll have to do some testing ourselves to see whether Windows 11 offers a notable boost in performance, however, along with how well the new chips stack up against competition from AMD and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_xCcCodcpDa8ZoE6uWXm3qUfEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957888/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="biaAmg"&gt;And while Intel often brands each year’s chips as a new generation, the 12th Gen lineup (starting with today’s desktop release) truly deserves the title. It represents not just the biggest leap for Intel’s desktop chips in years but the debut of a new approach for Intel as to how it designs its best chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmN5bq"&gt;The new lineup of Alder Lake chips are the first of Intel’s desktop chips to move beyond the 14nm process that the company has been using since it was first introduced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9094209/intel-skylake-processor-launch-release-date-price"&gt;2015’s 6th Gen Skylake chips&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the new 12th Gen chips will be released on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;freshly rebranded Intel 7 process&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as Intel’s third-generation 10nm process, or Enhanced Superfin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmWUyQ"&gt;As Intel has already explained, the new Alder Lake chips are a new approach to x86 chips for the company, one that strongly resembles the approach that Arm has been taking for years (and which has seen such success on Apple’s M1 line of chips). Instead of simply relying on cramming as many power-hungry cores as it can into a single chip, the Alder Lake hardware combines “performance” cores (broadly similar to Intel’s Core-class processors) with “efficiency” cores (closer to its Atom-class cores) for a mix of power and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LXpb4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest change in Intel’s desktop chips since 2015&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HXxbe"&gt;Intel has dabbled with this idea before, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;2020’s Lakefield chips&lt;/a&gt;, but those were a far more limited set of chips designed for low-powered hardware. Alder Lake, on the other hand, aims to power full-scale desktops as Intel’s flagship CPU, in addition to laptops and ultra-portable devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvDggq"&gt;The 12th Gen chips also represent a chance for Intel to redeem itself after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22325460/intel-11th-gen-desktop-chips-rocket-lake-s-faster-speeds-cores-gaming"&gt;lackluster 11th Gen desktop lineup&lt;/a&gt;, which tried to compensate for Intel’s aging 14nm process and its struggles with 10nm manufacturing delays by using the 10nm designs back-ported to the 14nm process. But due to differences in the two architectures, Intel was forced to reduce the number of cores it could offer on the 11th Gen chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/30/21242512/intel-10th-gen-desktop-lineup-offers-gaming-processor-speed"&gt;compared to the 10th Gen hardware&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmMBoq"&gt;As a result, last year’s models offered poor multithreaded performance compared to their processors: &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16535/intel-core-i7-11700k-review-blasting-off-with-rocket-lake/19"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s thorough review&lt;/a&gt; points out, the 11th Gen chips offered little to no gain (and even, in some cases, worse performance) for gaming, while also running far hotter and more power-hungry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50DDTX"&gt;The new desktop chips are also only the beginning: Intel has big plans for the hybrid Alder Lake architecture, which includes mobile chips (an example shown featured six P-cores and eight E-cores) and ultra-mobile chips (like a model with two P-cores and eight E-cores) for laptops and other portable devices in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw1kIh"&gt;Preorders for the new Intel 12th Gen chips start today, with the chips available on November 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese students sue Apple for not including a charger with the iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76TwOZbnrXRHOnvaO5GXkTkGv1g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052302/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="poI4Sh"&gt;Five Chinese students are suing Apple for not providing a charger with the iPhone 12, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vqmb/apple-sued-china-iphone-chargers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;stopped including EarPods and wall chargers with iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, opting only to include a USB-C to Lightning cable in its packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, ditching the charger and EarPods is supposed to reduce carbon emissions and preserve raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf2nzM"&gt;There’s some skepticism as to whether Apple really did this to cut costs, rather than save the environment, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;the transition to 5G could make iPhones more expensive to make&lt;/a&gt;. Skipping out on chargers and EarPods could be a way for Apple to save a buck, and forcing customers to purchase accessories separately may help increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXtIhD"&gt;The students’ argument in court, which is a part of the Xiaocheng Cup Public Welfare Litigation Competition, cruxes on this premise. A report by the &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/z4w89z7vhGdeTY2algqlYw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes the case in detail, noting that one of the students, named Xiaofang, was frustrated that her purchase of the iPhone 12 Pro Max didn’t come with a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66GsW9"&gt;Xiaofang points out that since the cable included with the device is a USB-C to Lightning, it’s not compatible with the wall chargers that were previously included with Apple devices (via &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;). This means that customers will have to purchase a USB-C-compatible charger or a MagSafe charger if they don’t have one already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxHSQY"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, Xiaofang claims that Apple is leaving out wall chargers to promote its MagSafe chargers, a line of magnetic chargers that powers your phone wirelessly. She alleges that Apple’s decision not to include a charger is motivated by profit, and that Apple is merely operating under the guise of saving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6aYMwb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j5Bc3i"&gt;Xiaofang and her colleagues took Apple to the Beijing Internet Court, asking for Apple to provide a wall charger, as well as pay 100 yuan ($16) for breach of contract and for litigation fees (via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;). As mentioned in the report by the &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;, a representative for Apple argued that it’s common for companies to sell phones without a charger and noted that the iPhone 12’s packaging makes it clear that no charger is included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFFHw1"&gt;The case is reportedly still in progress and has since gone viral on Chinese social media site Weibo, where the students have seen an outpouring of support (via &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202110/1237420.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Suing Apple for such a small sum may seem odd, but it’s the statement that matters. According to the report by &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a Chinese student sued the Shanghai Disney Resort in 2019 for just 50 yuan ($7) for not letting customers bring food into the park — Disney later conceded and agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc0fCf"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple has faced legal issues for not providing chargers. Earlier this year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22342051/brazil-regulator-fines-apple-2-million-chargers-iphone-12"&gt;Brazilian regulator fined Apple $2 million&lt;/a&gt; for failing to include chargers with the iPhone 12, alleging that Apple is misleading the customer by selling it without one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="adjRl1"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab835/is-this-timothee-chalamets-xbox-modding-youtube-channel-an-investigation"&gt;Vice published an extensive investigation&lt;/a&gt; examining the rumors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"&gt;future worm-rider Timothée Chalamet&lt;/a&gt; had a previous life as an Xbox 360 controller modder. The investigation includes contributions from Aric Toller, a lead researcher and trainer at &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/"&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism outfit regularly known for investigating war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XRKbg"&gt;The collaboration between the two noted journalism outfits is extensive. Vice reporters Matthew Gault and Emanuel Maiberg worked with Toller to examine images of Chamalet’s hands, and specifically a scar on his left ring finger, and compare them to screenshots of the hands of anonymous Youtuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsWktrEcKh0"&gt;ModdedController 360&lt;/a&gt;. They also carefully examined images of a young Chamalet’s bedroom that the actor had &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRo4hWGrnmV/"&gt;previously posted to Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and compared those images to footage from the Youtube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3E2dQD"&gt;“Ya, seems like it’s him,” Toller told Vice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKXThZ"&gt;A fact that likely would have been confirmed had Vice followed Youtuber Nate Hill, who interviewed Chalamet and Zendaya last week for &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. There Chalamet immediately laid the rumors to rest. “I actually had a YouTube channel people found. It’s &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/user/ModdedController360"&gt;youtube.com/moddedcontroller360.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPMzxi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xv5l-hisFuA?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=486&amp;amp;start=486" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk69xc"&gt;He told Hill he made approximately $30 modding controllers for friends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This company is making digital humans to serve the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEOhZQx3fGu6aNt8nSIllFsMJi8=/0x0:1347x898/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052176/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet Sam&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yqYUAF"&gt;In a stark white browser tab, Sam — a young blonde woman with perfectly shaped lips — asks me for the solution to 2+2. I immediately think of the infamous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt; in which a tortured Captain Picard is shown &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk3EsXgXcyQ"&gt;four lights&lt;/a&gt;. If he admits there are five lights, the ordeal will stop. “There are &lt;em&gt;four &lt;/em&gt;lights!” Picard shouts defiantly. Of course, I’m not being tortured. I’m at home, staring at the future face of the metaverse and trying valiantly not to think about memes from a TV show known for its exploration of ethics and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9nnB2"&gt;Sam isn’t a real person — she’s a digital human created by Auckland-based tech company Soul Machines. Designed to have &lt;a href="https://hello.soulmachines.cloud/session"&gt;a short conversation with visitors&lt;/a&gt; about herself, she runs on a proprietary “digital brain” and studies my expressions via webcam. At one point Sam asks me to smile but can’t seem to register my biggest, brightest “cheese.” I wonder if I’m just bad at emoting. When she asks if I know what autonomous animation is, I respond “No, but you’re about to tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amcN4D"&gt;“Good answer!” Sam chirps. “You should come and do my job!” She then explains that it means her speech and action aren’t pre-recorded — she can respond to every moment like a natural interaction. Digital people running on Soul Machines’ dystopian-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjclQ3m5JRw"&gt;Humans OS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; can use their hands and will one day be able to use full-body motions. “Does that make me more relatable to you?” she asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcpxhy"&gt;When we think of the metaverse, popularly depicted as a game-like virtual environment where humans use avatars to live, work, and play, we’re often the main characters. But it’s Soul Machines which will be filling the metaverse with what co-founder Greg Cross refers to as a “digital workforce” — a stream of bespoke Sams who will form the equivalent of NPCs in nascent digital worlds, as well as extensions of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMvTvN"&gt;“When we’re playing a game, we adopt a certain persona or personality, when we’re coaching our kids’ football team we adopt another persona, we have a different personality when we’re at the pub having a beer with our mates,” Cross explains. “As human beings, we’re always adjusting our persona and the role we have within those parameters. With digital people, we can create those constructs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="zJdSXn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjclQ3m5JRw?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=52&amp;amp;start=52" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Iu3EY"&gt;Right now, Soul Machines mostly makes digital people for customer service and &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/industries/public-sector/"&gt;public outreach&lt;/a&gt;, but they’ve also worked with &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/industries/entertainment/"&gt;will.i.am&lt;/a&gt; and Carmelo Anthony; in will.i.am’s&lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/technology/#popmake-35642"&gt; short promotional video&lt;/a&gt; for his digital twin, the Black Eyed Peas rapper observes a pimple that Soul Machines replicated on his face. The company has digital people repping the World Health Organization, Maryville University, Westpac bank, the New Zealand police, and SK-II skincare. Ruth is a &lt;a href="https://cookiecoach.tollhouse.com/"&gt;digital baking coach&lt;/a&gt; who works for Nestle. The company has been doing this for years, starting with &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/resources/research/baby-x/"&gt;BabyX&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 — a prototype AI that remains the core of its research arm. Cross’ co-founder is engineer Mark Sagar, who had an Oscar-winning digital effects career in Hollywood (including a stint at Weta Workshop) before returning to the &lt;a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering/community-engagement/alumni/alumni-stories/mark-sagar.html"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; to create BabyX, which is modeled after his daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFdEFT"&gt;There are naturally other players in the digital person industry, like the &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/this-startup-is-launching-a-new-ai-media-lab-to-create-human-avatars-for-brands/"&gt;AI Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (AIF) which also boasts a mixed team of scientists and entertainment veterans, including AI-driven game creator Lars Buttler (Trion Worlds), visual effects artist Rami Hachache (creator of fake Quibi celebrity &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/who-kirby-jenner-new-parody-hilariously-spoofs-keeping-kardashians-t182400"&gt;Kirby Jenner&lt;/a&gt;), and Hollywood executive Joe Drake from Lionsgate. AIF’s website offers even less insight into the nuts and bolts of their tech, aside from a similar general message about “bringing the potential of AI to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Ya6YuK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10828437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnuSTv"&gt;Soul Machines stands apart for two reasons. Through Sagar’s groundbreaking research, it’s a pioneer in bringing hard neuroscience to the art of creating digital humans, which are a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRyM52GQ7Ks"&gt;staple part&lt;/a&gt; of the Hollywood special effects arsenal. Second, it’s already got digital people working in the field with “teachable” digital brains borne out of the work done with BabyX, who is now a toddler; the company can’t release a full list of its digital laborers without each client’s consent. Yet, poring over the company’s white paper doesn’t yield much more than an extended summary of how the digital brain animates cutting-edge CGI to allow its digital people to adapt to real-time interactions. At the moment its digital people still require guidance from a human “trainer.” Soul Machines’ end goal is to teach a digital person how to make goal-based (and one day, value-based) decisions, which is still a long way off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drQiwL"&gt;“At some point in the future,’ says Cross, “you might be able to create a digital version of yourself or multiple versions of yourself, and they can go out and do stuff, make money for you, make money for your company, while you’re doing something else that’s a whole lot more fun.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0vEPu"&gt;My first thought is that this is going to be an absolute field day for MMORPG botters farming for resources. But Cross goes on to suggest using a digital person to play a game like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. “Those types of digital people are what we call human-enabled or human-driven digital people, they’re mimicking — they’re under the instruction of real people,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFUb6G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is a curious choice. It’s a skill-based multiplayer game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"&gt;where cheating is an open problem&lt;/a&gt;, and one where bragging rights hinge on having flesh-and-blood opponents. “A large part of the appeal of multiplayer games is playing another human, and knowing that you are matching wits and reflexes with another human brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.markrjohnsongames.com/"&gt;Mark Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who studies digital culture and emerging forms of labor at the University of Sydney. “In this regard I’m not sure how digital people would be different from just a really strong AI ... and while those are interesting, it’s telling how little people play against AIs when human players are available, no matter how savvy the AI competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZOZv1"&gt;Most MMOs don’t allow bots or third-party services; historically, one of the most straightforward ways to identify a botter in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; was to strike up a conversation with a suspicious player and see if they would respond like a real person. “There are many obvious reasons for these sorts of rules and ‘digital people’ would massively upset these and force us to profoundly rethink ideas around play, work, fairness, the use of our time,” Johnson adds. “If it’s just a competitive multiplayer game, or even a single player game, the entire point is to play the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4v2x8I"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvX71Y_MDGc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BPGPfe"&gt;Beyond games, Soul Machines has loftier aspirations for its digital people, which starts to veer toward the kind of excitable Panglossianism that colored the early internet years. Cross is quick to clarify that Soul Machines wants to do good, and the company has publicly stated that it &lt;a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/300321814/it-can-be-used-incredibly-badly-ai-developer-soul-machines-will-ban-politicians-from-creating-digital-twins"&gt;won’t let politicians use its services&lt;/a&gt; to avoid amplifying extremism. “It’s important that companies and people learn from each generation of technology we’ve created and think about how we want to do things differently going forward,” Cross says, pointing to healthcare and education as classic examples where infrastructure and resources are a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ImtDa"&gt;“We don’t see digital people replacing healthcare professionals and teachers, we see a means to augment and amplify them,” Cross says. “We just don’t attract people into those positions at that moment based on what we’re prepared to pay them.” Where a less advantaged person may not be able to afford one-on-one time with a doctor or teacher, Soul Machines’ digital people — each programmed and trained in the relevant field and deployed at scale — would theoretically allow anyone to experience a greater degree of personalized care (which still requires an internet connection and webcam). He goes on to explain that in a hypothetical banking situation, users might feel more comfortable talking to a digital person about their personal finances. “We have a lot of hard data now that there are many people in many interactions who prefer to speak to digital people over real people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kEQhOU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are unable to replace human teachers who have a monopoly on knowing how to be human.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hSd2wI"&gt;Virtual and augmented reality are already being used in teaching environments, but the idea of using digital people to supplement a uniquely messy human experience is understandably controversial. “Our children learn how to be social, emotional, ethical, complex, ambiguous creatures in the world partly by watching what the adults in their lives model for them — and they are watching teachers for something like 30 hours per week for 12 years of their life,” says &lt;a href="https://nickkellyresearch.com/"&gt;Nick Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in design education and cognition at the Queensland University of Technology. He acknowledges that technology can improve schooling, but it’s a complex issue, and the idea of students using AI isn’t inherently dangerous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HF0g1"&gt;“It doesn’t matter how well animated the ‘digital person’ is, how high their resolution is, or how well-programmed they are to provide ‘individual attention,’ they are unable to replace human teachers who have a monopoly on knowing how to be human — now and in the foreseeable future,” Kelly explains, pointing out the dangers of having a for-profit company, working with governments, to determine the shape of entire education systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXXf6R"&gt;Introducing digital people into the healthcare system, especially given &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology"&gt;tech’s notoriously poor issues with digital privacy&lt;/a&gt;, offers a whole new set of problems, like whether it’s ethical to let users choose how a digital worker looks or behaves. Soul Machines’ Humans OS 2.0 platform can &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/human-os-platform/"&gt;create a digital person in real-time&lt;/a&gt;; at &lt;em&gt;best &lt;/em&gt;this means a Black user might feel more comfortable speaking to a Black digital person, and at worst it could mean that racists could opt for an artificial environment of white customer service. Women would be able to choose to speak to a female-presenting digital person about bra fittings or puberty problems, which could theoretically be nice for teens who don’t want to do that with a parent. But these options, for all their business-centric benefits, could potentially feed existing prejudices and create a false sense of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWPXY"&gt;This new digital workforce would also operate under a specific set of conditions. “When we create a digital brand representative for a big enterprise, of course, they’re not going to have the ability to express negative emotions,” Cross explains. “We’re expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the values of that particular role.” It’s a troubling standard when you consider how Big Tech dehumanizes its workers today, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/26/amazon-workers-are-rising-up-around-the-world-to-say-enough"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; leading the pack. While digital humans don’t need rest (or basic compassion), a corporate “positive vibes only” mandate means changing the way we perceive and interact with “customer service” even as it wears a human face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8KKl7"&gt;“People are more aware of what data is getting captured and how it’s getting captured and how it’s getting used,” Cross says when I ask him about ethics of metaverse construction, especially in the wake of an era when Google once bore the slogan “don’t be evil.” “Every wave of new technology has been used to make a huge difference in the world, in terms of productivity, democratization, our ability to travel... technology has always been used by most of us to do incredibly good things and by a few of us to do the things that aren’t very nice or simply plain evil. That is a reflection of the human condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCqrg3"&gt;It’s an interesting ideal to hold up in an age where Facebook is being rightfully pilloried as an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/26/indisputable-harm-caused-by-facebook/"&gt;“indisputable” source of harm&lt;/a&gt; to its millions of users, especially when you consider its origins as a glorified “hot or not” for Mark Zuckerberg’s fellow Harvard students. Over at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Ian Bogost points out that tech-driven metaverse buildup is very much “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/"&gt;a fantasy of power and control&lt;/a&gt;” that twists and romanticizes a sci-fi concept into an equally twisted escape route for billionaires who don’t need to contend with the reality of their capitalist legacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKf0Z5dWpoTSjNxCGY6Z2haVGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956494/unnamed_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GVd02E"&gt;As we wade into more metaverse hype, it’s clear that companies like Soul Machines will be filling in customer service gaps across every industry, from games to healthcare. In fielding my questions, Cross exudes the serene patience of a man who knows that his work will take years, if not several decades, to really take off. “I would argue that the human touch is already being lost (something we see as accelerating),” he says in a follow-up email, pointing to the rise in transactional apps like the kind we see in online banking. “This is exactly why we see empathetic customer experiences as being a very important part of connecting with people in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwdep5"&gt;But if digital people are going to form the backbone of this bold new universe that transcends the physical world, their evolution in games should invite the same level of scrutiny as it would in other areas like healthcare and education. Gaming isn’t just something you do to kick back and relax anymore — it’s a billion-dollar industry with whole ecosystems of developers, artists, producers, voice actors, QA professionals, marketers, and streamers. Microtransactions, “gamblification,” and pay-to-win features are often a big part of multiplayer and mobile games. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s in-game purchases, for instance, reflect a very specific vision of a functioning metaverse economy that relies on cosmetic skins and topical pop culture. Big games are a distinctly corporate machine, and using digital people to humanize an already hyper-aggressive capitalist environment could have dire social and cultural consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afv1Ev"&gt;“The ‘blockbuster’ games industry has not exactly been renowned in recent years for its ethical practices, whether we’re looking at microtransactions, games as a service, loot boxes, skin betting, or whatever else,” says Johnson. “All of these phenomena have brought along major ethical questions that are only now really beginning to be interrogated and dealt with (research and legislation always, sadly, come after new developments) ... I honestly can’t believe the big-money parts of the games industry are going to do anything ethically, frankly, unless they explicitly prove to us otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DGPvEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A digital workforce has more utility as the metaverse evolves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mjzJZq"&gt;Soul Machines’ work also raises questions about how digital people would work across different metaverses in an industry where console companies are notoriously insular; for instance, if you had a digital person assistant, how would they traverse seamlessly through different game franchises and IPs and retain a sense of continuity? How would a simulated human presence affect our relationship with games as a fantasy escape, a livelihood, a relaxing hobby, or all of the above? What kind of tensions would arise in the gaps between people who can afford digital personae and those who can’t or won’t use them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="033oMT"&gt;Limiting digital people to NPC roles seems a benign enough start. “Creating big multiplayer games is a huge cost. It’s a huge amount of investment … all of the different animations, and all of the different scenarios that could play out,” says Cross. “What we’re looking at in autonomous animation is digital people that can respond in real time based on what they see, what they hear, and what’s going on around them.” He offers an example — creating more adaptable villains to create a more lifelike sense of immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl8F94"&gt;While digital people aren’t murderous terminators here to take over the world, they’re already being used as a building block in our slowly (but surely) evolving new meta-world. “A digital workforce has more utility as the metaverse evolves, as it becomes an economy or a series of economies and industries and businesses,” Cross says. “So that’s why we think the sort of animation that we’re doing, the autonomous animation we’re doing with digital people is really, really going to be a core piece of metaverse construction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EaxS3e"&gt;If we’re thinking about a workforce in terms of sheer utility, it makes sense to use the hell out of an omnipresent AI with the capacity to simulate human behavior. But given the cost of reaching that point — a distant point where digital people are indistinguishable from the real deal — it seems like they can only be used to turn profits, as vehicles for capitalism on steroids. Examining digital people raises a mirror to our own faces, of what we want to see in our workforce and labor and how we see those doing the same work right now. I probably won’t be alive to see Soul Machines reach the peak of its journey, nor will Cross, but something tells me Sam — at least a small part of Sam — will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music officially launches on the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuU-7Cr-UMxNhdtSzswTipThzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052084/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uOoQoN"&gt;Apple Music is coming to a gaming console, and it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/27/apple-music-launches-on-ps5-today/"&gt;the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;. The new app lets Apple Music subscribers stream music on Sony’s latest console, similar to what was already available with Spotify. Audio can play in the background while you’re gaming or just play on its own. Instructions on how to set up Apple Music for your PS5 are available &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/set-up-apple-music/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Music running on the PlayStation 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oiom00ANabhzFV9dcfx3zw2ePHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959764/FCtqOYEWYAkJdCy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music running on the PlayStation 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LN1ATV"&gt;This is the PS5’s second major integration with an Apple service; both Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;launched with the Apple TV Plus app last year&lt;/a&gt;. Sony extended the partnership to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588577/ps5-sony-apple-tv-plus-six-month-trial-subscription"&gt;six months of free Apple TV Plus membership&lt;/a&gt; to PS5 owners earlier this year. Having Apple Music on a console is a nice addition if you’re looking to simplify your TV setup and avoid having to switch too much between dedicated streaming boxes and built-in apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VmYJa"&gt;News of the PS5’s Apple Music app emerged after a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;Reddit user spotted&lt;/a&gt; the streaming service in the console’s music menu, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; was subsequently able&lt;/a&gt; to get the icon to appear by creating a new account. Apple Music is also available on Android, Amazon Echo, Chrome OS, Sonos, the web, and of course, Apple’s own range of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s link stickers are rolling out to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8gN_hpooJKLMGZzt-nKZFqXAu8=/0x1:1619x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051991/Link_Sticker.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stickers appear in Stories posts, and can link out to external sites.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9sdHS"&gt;Instagram’s link stickers, which let you include hyperlinks in Stories in the form of stickers, will now be available to everyone on the platform, the Facebook-owned social media network has announced. Instagram started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;testing link stickers in June&lt;/a&gt;, but until now the feature has been limited to verified accounts or accounts with a large number of followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eBiZL"&gt;According to the social network, link stickers are useful for anyone from businesses linking out to their products to activists linking out to external resources. But Instagram concedes that anyone can benefit from link sharing to engage with their followers. It also says that accounts repeatedly sharing misinformation or hate speech will lose access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MJpYtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The successor to the swipe up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbVmX4"&gt;To add a link, head into the sticker tool from the top navigation bar after uploading content to your story, tap the “Link” sticker and enter the desired URL. It then functions like any other sticker on a Stories post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuBMW5"&gt;When it announced the link stickers feature in June, Instagram stressed that they’re only meant for Stories posts and said it had no plans to bring them to the main Instagram feed or other parts of the app. That remains the status quo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NkM9L"&gt;The link stickers feature has now entirely replaced “swipe up,” which was how Instagram users could previously link out to external webpages from their Stories, and which the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638222/instagram-swipe-up-link-sticker-roll-out"&gt;discontinued in August&lt;/a&gt;. But with today’s news, link stickers are now more widely available than swipe up ever was, since the old feature was only available to verified accounts or accounts with more than 10,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Frame TV is $300 off at Best Buy and Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DERJFJYLB90n_s7VXEWdkTl4EKg=/0x405:4194x3201/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051724/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a limited time, Samsung’s 55-inch, art-inspired QLED is down to $998, its best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3bphup"&gt;Nobody will deny the unique appeal of the Samsung Frame TV, which you can currently find at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $300 off its original MSRP. While the price is a bit steep for a 55-inch 4K TV, you’re really paying for the aesthetics and the QLED panel. When removed from its stand, the Frame TV is virtually indistinguishable from a framed piece of artwork on the wall, even going so far as to include an ambient art mode that’s designed to transform the HDR TV into a piece of decor rather than a passive appliance. The 2021 model offers some impressive specs as well, including support for Amazon’s Alexa, four HDMI ports, a 120Hz refresh rate, and the Tizen smart platform, which enables access to most major streaming services without the need for a Roku or other streaming device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdDmER"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAZ45N"&gt;The Logitech G903 Hero, one of the best gaming mice on the market, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to just $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching its best price to date. Sporting a 25K DPI sensor and a customizable layout allowing for up to 11 programmable buttons, this ambidextrous mouse left very little on the cutting room floor in terms of features. It features remarkable battery life but is also compatible with the Logitech Powerplay system, allowing you to wirelessly charge it using either the Powerplay mat or a third-party magnetic dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f3WAgd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MiDpfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752982"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82lWMb"&gt;The original entry in the Microsoft Surface line of laptops has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just drop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ped to $550 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. One of our biggest issues with this laptop when we originally reviewed it was the steep price point for otherwise underwhelming specs. This deal, however, makes the Surface Laptop Go far more palatable. While far from cutting-edge, this laptop can still hold its own with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU and integrated UHD graphics. This configuration comes equipped with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but this discount also extends to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSmp2trFHm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; which has been reduced to $700. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mwKhl7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuVWfv"&gt;Another excellent OLED deal from Vizio, the 55-inch version of the H1 series is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,000 at Best &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;. A 4K panel paired with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the H1 great for gaming, and the SmartCast platform grants access to most streaming services while HDR10 Plus compatibility offers an incredibly vivid picture. For connectivity, the H1 series includes a total of four HDMI 2.1 ports and a single USB port for powering external devices like a Roku Streaming Stick 4K. This particular model even includes composite video and optical audio inputs, and it supports AirPlay 2 alongside virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1XSJsJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9549851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTT7ef"&gt;If your PlayStation 5 is already running out of space, the 1TB version of the WD Black SN750 is currently available for $120 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-NVMe-Internal-Gaming/dp/B07M64QXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, half off its original MSRP. This M.2 SSD offers solid transfer speeds at 3,470MB/s, which helps cut down on load times, and the compact form factor makes for simple installation whether you need the extra storage on a PC or console. If you’re planning on upgrading the storage on your PS5, however, keep in mind that you’ll also need to install your own heatsink alongside the SN750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xz2aZO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"},{"title":"The PS5 SSD buying guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vxQC8J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlhLOb"&gt;A battery pack, charger, and adapter, the Anker PowerCore Fusion is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CPGM7TH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for an all-time low of $25 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with the promo code &lt;strong&gt;ANKR1622J21&lt;/strong&gt;. Our reviewer, Dieter Bohn, liked the sturdy design and how it consolidated the number of gadgets he needed to tote around. This battery pack shares a similar size to Apple’s 87-watt adapter and has both USB-A and USB-C ports to access the 5,000mAh battery. Just beware of the comparably low 30-watt limit on this charger, which isn’t sufficient to provide enough juice for more powerful portables like the MacBook Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306269/anker-powercore-fusion-usb-c-power-delivery-battery-charger-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMJejQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10658582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wzbLrC"&gt;We’re not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3araDp"&gt;The PS5 version of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, the first game to make &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Andrew Webster risk his life for an audio log, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html%3Futm_source%3Drakutenls%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3DGameSpot%26utm_campaign%3D10%26utm_kxconfid%3Dtebx5rmj3%26cid%3Dafl_10000087%26affID%3D77777%26sourceID%3DVZfI20jEa0c-EquovOwsU9XX63SrecT3mw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $40 at Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The US Copyright Office just struck a blow supporting the right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broken cracked iphone stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wrlVUxbfadBkKWD8up9DYus7LrY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051675/cracked-iphone-stock-1198.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuI6wW"&gt;The US Copyright Office is expanding a legal shield for fixing digital devices, including cars and medical devices. This morning, the office submitted &lt;a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/copyright/1201/2021/2021_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf"&gt;new exemptions to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, which bars breaking software copy protection. The resulting rules include a revamped section on device repair, reflecting renewed government pressure around “right to repair” issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojr0O0"&gt;The Register of Copyrights recommends &lt;a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2021/"&gt;Section 1201 “anti-circumvention” exemptions&lt;/a&gt; every three years, a process that has offered legal protections for everything from unlocking cellphones to ripping DVD clips for classroom use. In addition to renewing these and several other exemptions, this latest rulemaking adopts repair-related proposals from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, iFixit, and other organizations. The Librarian of Congress  adopted the recommendations in a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf"&gt;final rule&lt;/a&gt; that will take effect tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmalw9"&gt;The exemptions replace an itemized list of repairable devices with broad protections for any consumer devices that rely on software to function, as well as land and sea vehicles and medical devices that aren’t consumer-focused. The rulemaking doesn’t rewrite the exemption to cover all &lt;em&gt;non-&lt;/em&gt;consumer devices, and it doesn’t cover all “modification,” only “diagnosis, maintenance, and repair.” For video game consoles specifically, repair only covers repairing the device’s optical drives and requires reenabling any technological protection measures that were circumvented afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jlb0xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Repair organizations have been pushing exemptions for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezkjWc"&gt;“The petitioners did a good job of showing commonalities across different types of devices,” said Acting General Counsel Kevin Amer on a phone call with reporters. “We also are aware of some of the efforts that the executive branch has undertaken in this area,” including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order from the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; supporting third-party and consumer repair work. “We do think that this exemption will be useful and will help to facilitate that type of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma0jov"&gt;Other agencies — as well as state and federal lawmakers — have their own right to repair policies on the table. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;pledged to fight business practices&lt;/a&gt; that lock out independent repair shops. This copyright rulemaking doesn’t address those practices, but it helps lift a legal threat hanging over technicians and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ibbHG"&gt;Right to repair expansion sits alongside several other changes. The Copyright Office nixed some requests to expand an exemption for reproducing clips of movies and TV shows, for instance, but it supplemented the categories of people who can do this for educational use, covering education staff beyond faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LxeMo"&gt;The rule extends exemptions for converting video to accessible formats for people with disabilities, letting educators add subtitles or audio captions before someone requests an accessible version as long as they reasonably expect it will be needed. Video game players with disabilities can also circumvent systems that prevent them from using nonstandard input devices on computers, although the exemptions don’t add some broader requested accessibility protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W6BD6Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Copyright Office also updated exemptions for accessibility and medical data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbxVpQ"&gt;Meanwhile, archival libraries should be able to create copies of deteriorating disc-based media if they can’t find a replacement copy elsewhere. (The office rejected requests that people be able to break copy protection to shift media into different formats, however.) The report expands the language of an exemption for security researchers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUvvL"&gt;The new policy loosens &lt;a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2015/10/27/dmca-exception-granted-for-medical-device-research-patient-access-to-data/"&gt;a 2015 exemption&lt;/a&gt; granting access to medical device data, rewording it to cover devices that aren’t implanted and letting patients authorize third parties to access it, although some methods of access could still violate liability laws. It also grants jailbreaking exceptions for video streaming devices like the Apple TV and for routers and other networking hardware, as long as it’s not done to access pirated media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mH42Hx"&gt;Section 1201 remains a controversial (and, some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/digital-millennium-copyright-act-eff-supreme-court"&gt;critics contend,&lt;/a&gt; unconstitutional) piece of the DMCA. It’s intended to prevent breaking digital rights management software that protects copyrighted media, but as software becomes an increasingly important part of basic consumer devices, it’s cast a legal pall over myriad non-piracy-related activity. The renewal cycle also means that educators, security researchers, repair technicians, and others will go through this process again in a few years — but for now, they’ve seen some welcome changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new TVs will soon support Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn16Ht5TdjOu74_4qjvsD-Ztnw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051650/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RuB2k"&gt;Amazon is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;making its own TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today marks the release of the company’s Omni and 4-Series Fire TVs. As the 4K HDR sets start making their way to customers, Amazon is making one more last-minute announcement: it plans to add support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit features “soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAFoJJ"&gt;AirPlay 2 makes it easy to play content on the TV screen from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And HomeKit integration will allow the Omni and 4-Series TVs to be controlled by Siri or the Home app; it also makes it easy to include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGUV78"&gt;Amazon has already rolled out AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;some of its “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, these features have yet to come to the company’s standalone Fire TV streaming devices — including the just-released Fire TV Stick 4K Max. I’m not sure if that’s an intentional choice, but it’s a bit odd that Amazon is ready to announce support on day one for its brand-new TVs with nothing to share about AirPlay 2 coming to its cheaper devices. (Roku supports AirPlay 2 on both its players and Roku TVs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXQrx"&gt;The Fire TV Omni series TVs offer the better picture quality of the two lines and come with built-in far-field microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. The 65-inch and 75-inch models support Dolby Vision HDR, though there are also smaller 43-, 50-, and 55-inch sizes available with HDR10.&lt;/p&gt;
