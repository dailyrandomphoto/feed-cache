    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="il7XYS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;is getting a new hide and seek mode, visor cosmetics, achievements, and a fifth map, developer Innersloth announced at Summer Game Fest on Thursday. However, there wasn’t a date shared for any of those updates, so it’s not clear when you might be able to check them out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gch8tl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/261572/among-us-roadmap"&gt;In a blog&lt;/a&gt;, Innersloth also announced that account linking is on the roadmap as well, which should be handy if you play the game across multiple platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kdKKu0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;dev log for all info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/zS1fX4J3p9"&gt;https://t.co/zS1fX4J3p9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if you ask me questions that are answered in this dev log!! i will honk at you!!!&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1403059468481417218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2qsB0"&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday’s announcement, Innersloth teased a number of new features for the next big update, including upping the max player count from 10 to 15 players, new player colors to pick from (including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1400533508859203584"&gt;tan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1397696818499121156"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1395467085837307905"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1402386196077056002"&gt;maroon&lt;/a&gt;), and, perhaps most importantly, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1402003911825772548"&gt;ability to honk the airship’s horn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JVPDG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on PC, iOS, Android, and Switch. Innersloth has also announced that the game is on the way for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber offers to pay for drivers’ health insurance, and then yanks it away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHFK5W9UkEyA2G9i6z37gHEzHzI=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435107/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1fei1"&gt;Uber mistakenly sent out an email to some of its drivers and delivery workers last month offering to cover some of their health insurance costs — only to revoke the offer two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VLchn"&gt;On May 26th, an email from Uber with the enticing subject line “It’s a great time to get health coverage” appeared in the inbox of an unspecified number of the company’s drivers and delivery workers. When they opened the email, they were greeted by an even more alluring proposition: “Uber can help cover your healthcare costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKdlcx"&gt;Drivers and couriers for Uber are classified as independent contractors, making them ineligible for employer-sponsored health insurance plans. For years, many of these workers have lobbied for more benefits and protections, only to face strong opposition from Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6BpIb0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Uber can help cover your healthcare costs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="099LW1"&gt;So one can only imagine the shock from drivers who opened this email and saw an offer for subsidies ranging from $613.77 to $1,277.54, depending on the type of insurance plan they had and the amount of hours they worked each week. That kind of money could be transformative for drivers, many of whom subsist on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-03-08/uber-drivers-earn-pay-that-s-just-above-the-poverty-line"&gt;poverty-level wages&lt;/a&gt; and are struggling to find work amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;steep drop in demand&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. What could account for this radical change in position by Uber? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJJzoOjjfy3Dj0T6dzAoiP2xg0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650718/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_2.19.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The May 26th email promising health insurance subsidies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bwuj9P9eBjEv3a1DabgvV21U1so=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650717/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_2.19.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The June 9th email revoking those subsidies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BikqPu"&gt;As it turns out, nothing has changed. Uber intended only to send the email to drivers and delivery workers in California, and not any other state. “Unfortunately, we made a mistake sending this email to you, as this policy only applies to drivers and delivery people in California,” the email to one driver read. “We sincerely apologize for this error.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l09ZJJ"&gt;A spokesperson said that the company’s support team is working with drivers and delivery workers who received the email by mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpOEih"&gt;Last year, Uber — along with Lyft, DoorDash, and other gig economy companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;poured over $200 million&lt;/a&gt; into the “Yes on 22” campaign to exempt them from a California state law that would require them to treat their workers like employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;The companies aggressively opposed the law&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it would eliminate driver flexibility, while also increasing consumer prices and wait times. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;The measure passed in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; with 59 percent of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3R1MI"&gt;Under Prop 22, Uber and other gig work companies are required to “provide healthcare subsidies equal to 41 percent the average [California Coverage] premium for each month” for drivers and couriers “who average between 15 and 25 hours per week of engaged time.” This would explain the email, but doesn’t explain why it also ended up in the inboxes of drivers and couriers who don’t reside in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ueotce"&gt;Edward Burmila, a political science professor who lives in Raleigh, NC and occasionally drives for Uber, received the original email about healthcare subsidies. “I may be an atypical Uber driver — I have a PhD and so tend to think of these things in a political context — but it is part of the ludicrous song-and-dance the ride-share companies are always doing to maintain the fiction that their labor force are not employees or workers,” Burmila wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="873FC1"&gt;He added, “It also demonstrates that they’ll provide benefits — for riders or for passengers — only when they are forced to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtZAcV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xZFFP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a fantasy game starring Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nR4IzsBS6xVgjJtX2TGrNaGTZ2s=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_11.12.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands&lt;em&gt; hits early next year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gearbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAp591"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; developer Gearbox and 2K Games announced a new fantasy shooter called &lt;em&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands &lt;/em&gt;on Thursday at Summer Games Fest. It has an all-star cast, including Andy Samberg, Will Arnett, Wanda Sykes, and Ashly Burch. The new game is set to launch in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdvdRL"&gt;At the event, Burch, who voices Tiny Tina in the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; series, described it as a “high fantasy looter shooter,” and in the trailer, it certainly looked a lot like a &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; game, both with its cel-shaded visual style and the appearance of a ridiculous-looking gun that shot some kind of electric laser beam. Unlike in &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, though, you’ll create your own character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s7vwCh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Shoot  , loot  , slash ⚔️, and cast ✨ your way to defeating the Dragon Lord   in Tiny Tina’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayWonderlands?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PlayWonderlands&lt;/a&gt;   arriving early 2022!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/oKR01DRLjd"&gt;https://t.co/oKR01DRLjd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/McQFDD6ZFr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/McQFDD6ZFr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GearboxOfficial (@GearboxOfficial) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1403054151047782404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jvTVZ"&gt;The game will be coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC (on Steam and the Epic Games Store), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X when it launches early next year. It will have a full-length campaign and four-player co-op, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22526609/tiny-tina-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-trailer-release-window-details"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding is getting a director’s cut on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Death Stranding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sesrIisuW-JOpUtbkd-dYGEpPkg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435028/ds_01_60.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hghUJ"&gt;Hideo Kojima stopped by this year’s Summer Game Fest to announce a surprise: &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; is not only coming to the PS5, but it’ll be an enhanced director’s cut of the game. Unfortunately, there’s no real detail about the new version, but an early glimpse hinted at some additional stealth elements, similar to Kojima’s work on the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Players can likely expect visual and performance upgrades as well. The director’s cut is slated as “coming soon,” with a proper reveal in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXzDMU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; first launched on the PS4 in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima"&gt;made its way to the PC last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft teases new Windows 11 startup sound with 11-minute video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/el5QcgYKIM2mORZYH5G53Qar9m0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434932/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uchFNS"&gt;Microsoft is back teasing Windows 11 again. In a new video on YouTube, the software giant has published an 11-minute (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) collection of startup sounds from various versions of Windows. They’re all slowed down by 4,000 percent, and Microsoft positions this as a relaxing video for those far too excited by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;the Windows event on June 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC0PR7"&gt;“Having trouble relaxing because you’re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event?” asks the YouTube caption. “Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP, and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000 percent reduced speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZGyhX"&gt;I think this is very much teasing a new startup sound for Windows 11, or whatever the next version of Windows will be called. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing “a new version of Windows” recently&lt;/a&gt;, and has dropped a number of hints that it could in fact be called Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZgG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft to reveal its next generation of Windows on June 24th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"},{"title":"Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HZtkXS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft loves the number 11 right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRcYbt"&gt;Among those hints is the event starting at 11AM ET and the event invite that has a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft execs have been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s clear from this latest video that these 11 teasers will continue in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X0LrH"&gt;We’re expecting Microsoft to announce a new version of Windows with significant user interface changes. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed “Sun Valley,” which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” There will be many other changes, including some significant Windows Store ones, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;read our previous coverage for what to expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqyX5v"&gt;We’ll find out on June 24th whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11, simply name it Windows Sun Valley, or something else entirely. The Windows elevent (as we’re now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

The hackers are reportedly advertising that the data is for sale on hacking forums, but that they’ll only consider offers from big-name members of the hacking community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyMogg"&gt;Source code is a big deal in programing, so it’s a big deal when companies lose control over it, and the gaming industry has seen some huge thefts recently: hackers stole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276664/cyberpunk-witcher-hackers-auction-source-code-ransomware-attack"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s&lt;/a&gt; source code for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;in February and in July of 2020, Nintendo saw the source code for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/26/21339018/nintendo-gigaleak-super-mario-64-zelda-pokemon-what-is-it-snes"&gt;many SNES and Nintendo 64 games&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and an unreleased Zelda game, released into the wild in what’s been dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/26/21339018/nintendo-gigaleak-super-mario-64-zelda-pokemon-what-is-it-snes"&gt;the “Nintendo Gigaleak.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu2BI2"&gt;While it’s unlikely that other reputable developers would use EA’s code on purpose, hackers being able to see the inner workings of a game or engine could &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2460240/hacker-group-targets-video-game-companies-to-steal-source-code.html"&gt;help them craft cheats&lt;/a&gt; or cracks — it could also reveal secret projects and game ideas, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/26/5549208/microsoft-early-code-contains-hidden-jokes"&gt;developer comments&lt;/a&gt; that companies would rather not see the light of day. Breaches also aren’t terribly great for a company’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WQd4M"&gt;In addition to EA’s own proprietary code and tools, the hackers claim they have Microsoft Xbox and Sony’s SDKs and API keys available for sale as well. Here’s a screenshot &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-gaming-giant-electronic-arts-steal-game-source-code/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that claims hackers have a total of 780GB worth of stolen data:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft and Sony tools may also be for sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQJB3x"&gt;An EA spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that hackers stole “a limited amount of game source code and related tools,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and said that the hackers didn’t have access to player data. They also said that the company had improved its security following the hack, and doesn’t expect an impact on its games or business. EA was clear to us that, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437730/colonial-pipeline-normal-ransomware-attack-fuel"&gt;recent string&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;of cybersecurity incidents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, this was not a ransomware attack, and that it’s working with law enforcement to investigate the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix just announced a huge slate of anime series and films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naVyKbul4UyioOnDRztoEt3Vy8E=/0x26:1280x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434657/GSP_Gdesign_yamamori_1007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ifyvio"&gt;Netflix’s expansion into anime continues. Today, the streaming service announced details for a number of exciting shows, ranging from a horror series with characters designed by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;’s Yoshitaka Amano to the next chapter in the &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; franchise to another Godzilla show. Here’s everything that was announced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jg4ctj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ODePBY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzxnPP5TLeU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0MdKr"&gt;The headliner was the return of classic mech franchise &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt;, with a series called &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;. “After Char’s rebellion, Hathaway Noa leads an insurgency against Earth Federation, but meeting an enemy officer and a mysterious woman alters his fate,” the description reads. It’s listed as coming soon and will eventually be joined by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380140/netflix-live-action-gundam-movie-jordan-vogt-roberts-legendary-sunrise"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt; from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="frKEoQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="EI1yEV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3ymwr_MJ2Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mOSW3O"&gt;August 9th will see the debut of &lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt;, a show about shamans fighting each other to become king. It’s a simple enough premise that looks to be buoyed by plenty of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZMESF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edens Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="uW6XfJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0T5TwEB7xo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDL8dR"&gt;Sci-fi manga &lt;em&gt;Edens Zero&lt;/em&gt; is becoming an anime, with an impressive-looking series about a boy who can control gravity. It’ll come out on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5tv5hr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="YgjGA1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's your first glimpse at Exception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new space horror anime series is based on a new story by Hirotaka Adachi (aka "Otsuichi"), with character designs by Final Fantasy's Yoshitaka Amano. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7CWhmNu9O6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7CWhmNu9O6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403023872312549391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7qVi"&gt;We don’t have a trailer for the horror series &lt;em&gt;Exception&lt;/em&gt;, but this one piece of teaser art is creepy enough on its own. Perhaps the most exciting part is that it will feature character designs from famed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; artist Yoshitaka Amano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qvrAFB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright: Samurai Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="yeUzIj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Announcing Bright: Samurai Soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Izo, a Ronin, and Raiden, an orc, work to bring a young elf girl and the wand she carries to the land of the elves in the north. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the Netflix movie, the anime film will be directed by Kyohei Ishiguro. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K03gZVMUie"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K03gZVMUie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403024398848724994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3OP7i"&gt;There’s no trailer for this one either, but the first image shows off a beautiful art style that I can’t wait to see in motion. No word on a premiere date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RK7qNq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make My Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ig53zN"&gt;On the film front, Netflix also announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403024167625129989"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make My Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which sounds like it will channel frozen horror classics like &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;: “On a cold planet of ice and snow, mysterious creatures suddenly have appeared from the dark underground and have begun to attack the inhabitants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nHmnHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla: Singular Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="2F5aNG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you see Rodan - run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Godzilla: Singular Point is available globally June 24th. Here's your first look at the English dub. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3wi6M4sslo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3wi6M4sslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403025037980880898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AaO953"&gt;This kaiju series debuted on Netflix in Japan earlier in the year, but it’ll be available globally — and in English — on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will shut down at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H5XaFSmRqA3ewzz7I7q36VS-jdo=/8x0:877x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434413/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.45.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Sky on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBnzIy"&gt;Following Apple’s acquisition of popular weather app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Dark Sky in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will be available until the end of 2022, co-founder Adam Grossman said in a Monday update to &lt;a href="https://blog.darksky.net/"&gt;Dark Sky’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAX1EV"&gt;The update about the 2022 shutdown hit the same day that Apple announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22527878%2Fdark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new weather features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; as part of its WWDC keynote presentation. The stock Weather app is getting a new design, full-screen weather maps, next-hour precipitation notifications, and even new animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWhDEQ"&gt;Dark Sky shut down the Android and Wear OS versions of its apps on August 1st, 2020. But the iOS app is still available &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357"&gt;for $3.99 on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in buying it ahead of next year’s shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KBtqm"&gt;The Dark Sky API will also continue to work for existing customers until the end of 2022. Previously, the API was set to stop working at the end of this year; now, it will work for a little while longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Netflix’s Masters of the Universe: Revelation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Masters of the Universe: Revelation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aitIrIR3g810MQspms8HBajgSL8=/282x0:3318x2024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434334/MastersoftheUniverse_Revelation_Part1_Episode1_00_16_53_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yxcxsx"&gt;Our first look at Kevin Smith’s revival of He-Man is here: today, Netflix debuted the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which will hit the streaming service on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78wlPi"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt;, which also streamed on Netflix, the new He-Man series isn’t a reboot of the classic cartoon. Instead, it’s a continuation, which picks up right after the original show ended in 1985, with the excellent addition of Mark Hamill as Skeletor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVmMrT"&gt;Here’s how Smith, who is serving as showrunner, describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rGBP7A"&gt;Narratively our show is set up as the next episode in the legacy ‘80s animated series that aired from 1983-1985. This is a continuation of that story. We’re playing with the original mythology and characters, and revisiting and digging deeper into some of the unresolved storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te5HDz"&gt;Visually we also made the conscious decision to lean into the &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; line of toys for inspiration as well. Mattel owns this entire vast library of that artwork, so right away we wanted the show to open with classic pieces of that artwork. Mattel has been committed to this look since they first started as a toy line in the ‘80s, and now we’re leaning into it and honoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UdhDjZ"&gt;The news was announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;the first week-long Netflix Geeked event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the debut of Tesla Model S Plaid, the ‘quickest production car ever made’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2_KM0ClvWDR4bb5AHy3cVWYwww=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434160/0x0_ModelS_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X8n8t"&gt;Tesla will hold a delivery event for its new, high-performance “Plaid” version of the Model S on Thursday. It’s an effort by Elon Musk’s company to reignite interest in its nearly decade-old electric sedan, which is also facing stiff competition from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. When its released, Musk claims the Plaid Model S will be the “quickest production car ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVL4lI"&gt;The event, which will be held at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, CA, will be livestreamed for the public starting at 7PM PT / 10PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 8:30PM PT). It was originally scheduled for June 3rd, but Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed it to the 10th&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting that the vehicle needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLuJqJ"&gt;The delivery of the refreshed Model S has also been delayed, with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;originally stating&lt;/a&gt; that it expected to begin shipping to customers in March. A revamped version of the Model X SUV was also expected to begin deliveries in March but has been pushed to an unspecified future date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XW7ms"&gt;The Plaid Model S wasn’t inevitable. Despite persistent rumors for years, Musk seemed uninterested in the idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1148443699858292736?lang=en"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that “[t]here is no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Tesla instead was constantly making minor improvements to both vehicles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTCANQ"&gt;But less than two months later, a prototype version of the Plaid powertrain made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at the Laguna Seca raceway&lt;/a&gt;, lapping the famous California racetrack in just one minute and 36 seconds. The company later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off another prototype as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020. Plaid, much like the “Ludicrous” acceleration mode in Tesla’s cars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0"&gt;is a reference to one of Musk’s favorite movies, &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd6NRG"&gt;We already know most of the relevant specs: an estimated range of 390 miles, a top speed of 200mph (with the “right tires,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354620643967438855?s=20"&gt;Musk has said&lt;/a&gt;), and a 0–60mph sprint in 1.99 seconds (although &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yigpPSu_o"&gt;there’s been some questions&lt;/a&gt; about the validity of that last claim). The new model is priced at $129,990, compared to $79,990 for a long-range Model S. A “Plaid Plus” version of the Model S, which was supposed to have a range of more than 520 miles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521769/elon-musk-tweets-tesla-plaid-plus-canceled"&gt;was canceled&lt;/a&gt; after Musk tweeted that basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWYf1w"&gt;The new Model S will also feature a simplified interior, with a landscape touchscreen similar to what’s found in the Model 3 and Model Y. There’s also a stalkless U-shaped butterfly steering wheel, much like what Tesla has said will appear in the forthcoming second-generation Roadster. And there’s an added screen behind the center console for rear-seat passengers. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, the new Model S still features a cockpit screen behind the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MrpUCg"&gt;Tesla says that the Plaid Model S should be able to do five times as many quarter-mile runs as previous Model S sedans, thanks to the new powertrain and the new heat pump that was developed for the Model Y. It will also come with an infotainment system that’s powered by a chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;capable of 10 teraflops of processing power&lt;/a&gt;, allowing passengers to play games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; (with wireless controller support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Ltyo"&gt;When it first launched in 2012, the Tesla Model S redefined electric luxury, with a sleek design and long driving range. But the company is facing a new wave of competition, with the release in recent years of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes EQS&lt;/a&gt;. If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yhljhT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxubKn"&gt;The abrupt cancellation of Plaid Plus, however, is raising questions about the automaker’s battery plans. Plaid Plus was supposed to feature Tesla’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;tabless 4680 battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells, which are supposed to enable longer ranges of 500 miles or more, are bigger than the company’s current cells, measuring 46 millimeters by 80 millimeters (thus the name). In addition to more energy and power, the new cells are expected to result in a 14 percent reduction in cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) at the cell form factor level only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks6oa1"&gt;Plaid Plus was supposed to get a range of 520 miles. While Musk could shock everyone Thursday night with a longer range Plaid than originally advertised, he also recently threw cold water on the idea of needing ranges longer than 400 miles. In a &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/06/elon-musk-tesla-canceling-model-s-plaid-need-400-mile-range/"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said “more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom, food, coffee, etc. anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzIIB"&gt;Ignoring for a moment that most restroom breaks last shorter than the time it takes to recharge an electric vehicle, Musk’s reversal on Plaid Plus could signal a delay in the production of Tesla’s 4680 battery cells. In addition to Plaid, the new cells are supposed to be used in Tesla’s Cybertruck and Semi vehicles, which are still expected later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiDhPp"&gt;In an April earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was still “12... to 18 months away from volume production of 4680.” It remains to be seen whether we’ll get an update on that estimate at the event Thursday evening. But with Musk, you never know for sure. &lt;/p&gt;
