    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 that moves is $40 off for the first time</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BWttr"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 smart display that can spin around to always be facing you, today’s your day. Normally $250, it’s down to $210 right now for the black or white versions, both of which feature a camera for video chats, as well as for tracking you in order to make sure the screen’s within view for convenience. This is the first price drop, and 16 percent off isn’t bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5gIY"&gt;This deal is available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon has the exclusive on a deal that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $5 more&lt;/a&gt; and lets you checkout with the Blink Mini home security cam added to your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huV3QT"&gt;There are several other Echo Show models, and aside from the rotating feature, this one provides a similar experience. My colleague Dan Seifert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;reviewed this new model&lt;/a&gt; recently, saying “Alexa in the new Echo Show 10 is largely the same Alexa you get on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17944022/new-amazon-echo-show-review-2018-alexa-speaker-video-camera"&gt;prior Echo Show&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16161058/amazon-echo-show-alexa-dot-which-one-to-buy"&gt;every other Alexa-powered smart display&lt;/a&gt;. You ask it for information — a weather report, a favorite playlist, news, calendar appointments, and so on — and it will give you a polite response and show the requested information on the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S9AZ16"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u37uez"&gt;The Beats Flex wireless neckbuds usually cost $50, but you can get the black, sky blue, or bright yellow models for $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones to charge via USB-C, making them equally suited for Android users as they are for the Apple ecosystem of devices. For folks heavily invested in Apple’s products, these have the Apple W1 wireless chip that makes these buds easily connect to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrM4bN"&gt;I own these, and I’ve found the sound quality to be delightful for the price, and the controls are simple enough to learn. But, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;as Chris Welch’s review mentions&lt;/a&gt;, they aren’t perfect. They aren’t rated for sweat resistance or waterproofing, and these don’t have great sound isolation when you’re surrounded by a fair amount of noise. Still, $40 is hard to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPjS3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4xEQq"&gt;If you have a Nintendo Switch and don’t yet own a high-capacity microSD card to store games on, Amazon’s deal of the day has your name on it. You can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk microSD card for $39&lt;/a&gt;, which is near the lowest-ever price (you’re getting more than 10GB per dollar here). Games for the Switch range in size between a few gigabytes to dozens, so this sub-$40 purchase should last you a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UGRcg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="BJozrz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tUoBVWclPCHOFXI2e6ict7m2r8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042052/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bezos has become a useful foil for Democrats&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vKpbXM"&gt;In the days leading up to the Bessemer union vote, Amazon is throwing punches. They’re just not aimed at workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBBqtf"&gt;As the Alabama warehouse votes on whether to unionize, Amazon has been facing mounting pressure from progressive lawmakers — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;on Friday, the company went on the offensive&lt;/a&gt;, calling out Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for their criticism of the company’s policies. Predictably, tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1375502593863073792"&gt;provoked more tweets&lt;/a&gt;, turning into days of jousting between progressives and a corporate PR account. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Bezos had personally encouraged the callout, worrying that his company was being too passive in the face of progressive pressure. Whatever the risks, Bezos clearly sees this fight as a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yaI0Rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos sees this fight as a winner — so do Democrats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DO1fvj"&gt;So do Democrats. It’s rare to see this much national involvement in a union drive, but President Biden jumped in earlier this month, expressing support in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306952/amazon-union-biden-statement-bessemer-alabama-warehouse"&gt;hedged but unmistakable terms&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a useful foil for a party trying to recapture working-class voters, and Amazon’s loose tweets could spark a much bigger fight. As Democrats respond to the economic fallout of the pandemic, Amazon makes an ideal antagonist, making billions while the rest of the economy withers. The pandemic has only intensified that disparity, shutting down in-person retail while Amazon’s e-commerce business thrived. The company is the perfect villain for a party eager to tell a story about economic justice — and while the Bessemer election will be counted and done in a few days, the fight between Amazon and Democrats may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QjqIu"&gt;Much of the Bessemer fight so far has come from Biden’s particular commitment to unions as a political force. Biden wants to be seen as enthusiastically pro-labor (a rare quality for a post-Clinton Democrat), and this is the most important labor effort in years for reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;we describe in detail here&lt;/a&gt;. So the Bessemer fight lets Biden stick up for the little guy and suggest his labor board will come down hard on any irregularities from Amazon. It casts Biden as a different kind of Democrat with more to offer the working class. It’s not just the right thing to do; it’s also good politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxuLEz"&gt;But that political calculus extends far beyond the Bessemer fight. Biden wants to be seen as a bold, progressive president taking on entrenched inequality. A public spat with Amazon makes it clear he’s trying, even if more ambitious efforts like the $15 minimum wage (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17929068/amazon-wage-raise-bernie-sanders-increase-15"&gt;Amazon’s preferred remedy&lt;/a&gt;) get lost along the way. And since tossing insults at Amazon is easier than reversing decades of economic damage, the feud gives Biden an easy way to show he’s trying. All he has to do is cast Amazon as the face of the problem — the leading edge of everything that’s wrong with the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="I21Xia"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon “not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLfPey"&gt;This month, &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374159276"&gt;a new book&lt;/a&gt; lays out the same story at a grander scale. Written by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Alec MacGillis, &lt;em&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/em&gt; is less about Amazon’s business than the social dislocation left in its wake, pairing Amazon’s rise to power with the struggles of a cardboard packer in Dayton or a small office supply store in El Paso. Many of the figures in the book aren’t even officially Amazon employees, instead working for contractors or selling on the company’s marketplace. Still, the overall message is clear: Amazon is growing rich and powerful off of these people’s work, while they scramble just to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T05fZK"&gt;In the introduction, MacGillis makes the case for Amazon as a poster child of this new style of American business explicitly. As he describes it, the idea for his book emerged when he realized Amazon was “an ideal frame for understanding the country and what the country was becoming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znhs0n"&gt;[Amazon] served as the ultimate lens on the country’s divides because it was present just about everywhere… It had segmented the country into different sorts of places, each with their assigned rank, income, and purpose. It had not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America — the options that lay before people, what they could aspire to do with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Duta0B"&gt;Of course, that economic chasm is much older than Amazon. The landscape of American opportunity has always been skewed, and the latest tectonics date back at least 50 years. Amazon has been at the forefront of many of those changes — particularly the shift to e-commerce, exurban fulfillment networks, and vastly scaleable online interactions. But Amazon didn’t cause those shifts; it just positioned itself to benefit from them. MacGillis acknowledges as much in how he describes the company: a lens, rather than the whole picture in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYyX2E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Political pressure will change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cvglRb"&gt;As Democrats scramble to connect with working class and rural voters, that lens can be a powerful political force. For decades, the party has struggled to describe the crushing divide in the American economy that has pushed wealth to major cities and left the rest of the country to decay. Since 2016, many of the voters on the wrong side of that divide have left the party for Trump, a trend that Biden is eager to reverse. Neither party has a meaningful plan to undo the structural damage, but Biden is hoping a surge in federal money will soften the blow, beginning with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/03/10/covid-19-stimulus-bill-joe-bidens-plan-explained-6-graphics/4601454001/"&gt;the trillion-dollar relief package&lt;/a&gt; and continuing with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/biden-putting-final-touches-potential-3-trillion-economic-package/6986152002/"&gt;trillions more&lt;/a&gt; in infrastructure spending planned for this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPsF8K"&gt;Democrats are hoping to cast those bills as a contemporary New Deal, rescuing the country from economic ruin while uniting it politically. Portraying Amazon as the face of that ruin — and using a public fight with the company as proof the party is serious about taking it on — is just good messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9760cR"&gt;A feud between Democrats and Amazon would also catch Republicans off balance, splitting the party between its populist rhetoric and pro-business policies. Since Trump, Bezos has been a rhetorical foil for Fox News, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://itep.org/from-0-to-1-2-amazon-lauds-its-minuscule-effective-federal-income-tax-rate/"&gt;benefited hugely&lt;/a&gt; from Trump’s tax cut and quadrupled in value over Trump’s four years in office. Even now, Republicans weighing in on the feud between Sanders and Amazon have found themselves &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1376318757845471232"&gt;in the awkward position&lt;/a&gt; of defending a company they’ve spent much of the past four years attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77pRqB"&gt;Amazon has plenty of resources to defend itself. The company is still wildly profitable, the second largest employer in the United States (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_United_States%E2%80%93based_employers_globally"&gt;after Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;) and the second largest federal lobbyist (&lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-tech-lobbying-update/"&gt;after Facebook&lt;/a&gt;). It will have ample chance to soften the blow of any new policies and is better equipped to ride out the changes than nearly any other company on Earth. Congress’ efforts to change Section 230 have been focused on Google and Facebook rather than Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21080720/amazon-product-liability-lawsuits-marketplace-damage-third-party"&gt;product liability issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;Pentagon contract aside&lt;/a&gt;, government work is still a relatively small part of the company’s business. After decades of unbelievable growth, there is only so much that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BpnCQQ"&gt;But political pressure will still change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways. Facebook was in this position in 2016 — suddenly blamed for Trump’s election, Brexit, and the fraying condition of liberal democracy across the world. Five years later, every new project is met with hostility, and ambitious politicians around the world look at the company as a prize waiting to be taken down. Most companies would try to avoid that fate. After this weekend’s dustup, Amazon seems to be leaning into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCB_yq1i0VB7wGza7_OzU_JLNGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041640/acastro_200730_1777_ai_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojPk2Z"&gt;One of the biggest trends in machine learning right now is text generation. AI systems learn by absorbing billions of words scraped from the internet and generate text in response to a variety of prompts. It sounds simple, but these machines can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;put to a wide array of tasks&lt;/a&gt; — from creating fiction, to writing bad code, to letting you chat with historical figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi7SBS"&gt;The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of robot verbiage&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmMKnT"&gt;OpenAI started life as a nonprofit, but for the last few years, it has been trying to make money with GPT-3 as its first salable product. The company has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusivity deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; which gives the tech giant unique access to the program’s underlying code, but any firm can apply for access to GPT-3’s general API and build services on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5A8Me"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No company stands to benefit more from GPT-3’s rise than OpenAI itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibGXBb"&gt;As OpenAI is keen to advertise, hundreds of companies are now doing exactly this. One startup named &lt;a href="https://askviable.com/"&gt;Viable&lt;/a&gt; is using GPT-3 to analyze customer feedback, identifying “themes, emotions, and sentiment from surveys, help desk tickets, live chat logs, reviews, and more”; &lt;a href="https://fable-studio.com/"&gt;Fable Studio&lt;/a&gt; is using the program to create dialogue for VR experiences; and &lt;a href="https://www.algolia.com/"&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt; is using it to improve its web search products which it, in turn, sells on to other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISqdta"&gt;All this is good news for OpenAI (and Microsoft, whose Azure cloud computing platform &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/openai-forms-exclusive-computing-partnership-with-microsoft-to-build-new-azure-ai-supercomputing-technologies/"&gt;powers OpenAI’s tech&lt;/a&gt;), but not everyone in startup-land is keen. &lt;a href="https://bakztfuture.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-startup-monopoly-with"&gt;Many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.allencheng.com/starting-a-business-around-gpt-3-is-a-bad-idea/"&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt; have noted the folly of building a company on technology you don’t actually own. Using GPT-3 to create a startup is ludicrously simple, but it’ll be ludicrously simple for your competitors, too. And though there are ways to differentiate your GPT startup through branding and UI, no firm stands to gain as much as from the use of the technology as OpenAI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMro4T"&gt;Another worry about the rise of text-generating systems relates to issues of output quality. Like many algorithms, text generators have the capacity to absorb and amplify &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;harmful biases&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also often astoundingly dumb. In tests of a medical chatbot built using GPT-3, the model responded to a “suicidal” patient by &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2020/10/28/medical-chatbot-openai-gpt3-patient-kill-themselves/"&gt;encouraging them to kill themselves&lt;/a&gt;. These problems aren’t insurmountable, but they’re certainly worth flagging in a world where algorithms are already creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301759/facial-recognition-detroit-police-wrongful-arrest-robert-williams-artificial-intelligence"&gt;mistaken arrests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications"&gt;unfair school grades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;biased medical bills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJE6DI"&gt;As OpenAI’s latest milestone suggest, though, GPT-3 is only going to keep on talking, and we need to be ready for a world filled with robot-generated chatter. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V2LxXv"&gt;A rare prototype of a Leica camera crafted by former Apple luminary Jony Ive and famed designer Marc Newson is being &lt;a href="https://www.leitz-auction.com/auction/en/auktion34/auction38/article/243.html"&gt;sold at auction in June&lt;/a&gt;. The device, which is described as being in “B+” condition, has a starting price of €100.000 (around $118,000), and the Leitz Photographica Auction house estimates that it’ll sell for between €200.000 and €250.000 (around $235,000 to $295,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYBEe1"&gt;The prototype was produced during the development of the one-off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity"&gt;Leica M for (RED)&lt;/a&gt; camera, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5140200/jony-ive-and-marc-newsons-red-charity-auction-raises-26-million"&gt;sold at a charity auction in 2013 for $1.8 million&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity"&gt;final product’s design&lt;/a&gt; shared a lot of similarities with Apple’s “cheesegrater” Mac Pro, this prototype appears to have a smooth reflective finish that looks like an absolute fingerprint magnet. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h0mvHp"&gt;The prototype, which is described as showing the “final development step” of the design process, is equipped with a Apo-Summicron 2/50 mm ASPH lens. There’s no mention of whether it actually functions as a camera, however. Here’s the full description from Leitz Photographica Auction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LFicnl"&gt;“A beautifully sculptured aluminium body with a matching Apo-Summicron 2/50 mm ASPH. lens — both showing distinctive features both designers are famous for. Only one finished camera has been made and was sold in an auction in 2013 for an amazing $ 1.8 M! The prototype we have the pleasure to offer shows the final development step when the camera took its final shape after hundreds of prototype parts have been made and tried. It is a beautiful piece of design and a very special opportunity for Leica collectors!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1c2Zgl"&gt;At the time, Leica said “a total of 561 models and nearly 1000 prototype parts” were made during the camera’s design process. The final Leica M for (RED) camera was sold alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133178/jony-ive-red-auction-sothebys-photos"&gt;over 40 other items&lt;/a&gt; at the auction, which raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5140200/jony-ive-and-marc-newsons-red-charity-auction-raises-26-million"&gt;around $26 million in total&lt;/a&gt; for charity. Newson later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6112035/apple-hires-legendary-designer-marc-newson-to-work-under-jony-ive"&gt;joined Apple to work under Ive&lt;/a&gt; the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics unveils Stretch: a new robot designed to move boxes in warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sjy85u1legXfkC92vCZgKG1Efy0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041281/BOSTONDYNAMICS_STRETCH_WAREHOUSE_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch is Boston Dynamics’ latest foray into logistics. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRuxfH"&gt;Boston Dynamics is best known for its robot dog Spot, a machine designed to work in a range of environments, from offshore oil rigs to deep underground mines. But in recent years, the company has increasingly focused attention on the logistics space, and today is unveiling a new robot with just one application in mind: moving boxes in warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0uRwo"&gt;The robot is called Stretch and looks relatively dull for a Boston Dynamics creation. It’s not modeled after humans or animals, and instead aims to be as practical as possible. It has a square mobile base containing a set of wheels, a “perception mast” with cameras and other sensors, and a huge robotic arm with seven degrees of freedom and a suction pad array on the end that can grab and move boxes up to 23 kilograms (50 lbs) in weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziX70S"&gt;What connects Stretch to other Boston Dynamics machines is a focus on mobility. Usually, when automation equipment is installed in warehouses the system is bolted down in one place with a workflow modeled around it. Stretch, by comparison, is designed to slide into any existing workplace where it could be useful loading or unloading goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q7m9XE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It all depends what the problem of the day is.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qqHmOh"&gt;“That’s what’s exciting about this system: it can provide automation to environments that don’t have automation infrastructure,” Boston Dynamics’ VP of business development Michael Perry tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can take this capability and you can move it into the back of the truck, you can move it into aisles, you can move it next to your conveyors. It all depends what the problem of the day is.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOdvyqmI5-Qij0qQBfQ8ozSZGoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22404986/BOSTONDYNAMICS_STRETCH_WHITE_BOXPICK_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch can run off batteries for eight hours at a time or switch to tethered power. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HzELE7"&gt;This will allow Boston Dynamics to target customers who would otherwise avoid automation as too expensive or time-consuming to integrate, says Perry. Around 80 percent of the world’s warehouses don’t have any automation equipment, giving the company a sizable addressable market. But Stretch doesn’t have a price-tag yet, and it could be that for businesses with low margins, a robot isn’t worth the hassle no matter how mobile it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdYKot"&gt;Boston Dynamics has been showing interest in the logistics space since 2019 when it &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/boston-dynamics-warehouse-robots-acquires-kinema-systems"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; Kinema Systems, a company that makes machine vision software for robots in warehouses. It then designed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285923/boston-dynamics-handle-robot-updated-box-stacking"&gt;wheeled robot called Handle&lt;/a&gt; that could move boxes using a robotic arm, balancing itself with a huge swinging counterweight like a tail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPZcf7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Boston Dynamics is bringing mobility to warehouse automation. Watch Stretch - our new case handling robot - move, groove and unload trucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the announcement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5B7wDDKC38"&gt;https://t.co/5B7wDDKC38&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/i3Dsoz9Tq8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/i3Dsoz9Tq8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boston Dynamics (@BostonDynamics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1376474451404058626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uagWe"&gt;Perry says Handle had “the right footprint and right reach” for warehouses, but couldn’t work fast enough. The robot’s arm is directly attached to its main body, meaning the whole machine had to move with each load. Stretch’s arm, by comparison, swivels freely thanks to some clever (and patent-pending) counterweights hidden inside its square base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pTwtM"&gt;“That’s really the secret sauce,” says Perry. “That base is able to handle the inertial force of the arm plus the box swinging at a fast weight, without having to rely on a several-thousand kilo steel plate bolted to the floor.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdLXJwxjla0qXwdcFn1A99PpTFE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22404987/BOSTONDYNAMICS_STRETCH_CONTAINER_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch’s vacuum grippers mean it can only handle boxes with flat surfaces — limiting its usefulness in certain warehouses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlxa1D"&gt;Stretch’s lineage can be traced back to Boston Dynamics’ two-legged Atlas robot, which is able to balance its weight so smoothly it can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"&gt;run, jump, backflip, and more&lt;/a&gt;. “Atlas picking up a box isn’t just about extending the arms and moving them, it’s about coordinating the hips, legs, and torso,” says Perry. “A lot of that same design thinking has gone into Stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3hYjy"&gt;As a result, Boston Dynamics claims Stretch can move up to 800 cases an hour, a through-put rate that’s comparable to that of a human employee. High-capacity batteries mean Stretch can operate for eight hours at a time before it needs recharging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP3Nna"&gt;That throughput rate, though, should be treated with skepticism. Putting robots to work in warehouses is incredibly difficult because of the sheer variation in these spaces. Workflows can change on a daily basis as different goods come and go, and what’s often valued is flexibility. The inability of machines to handle these challenges so far is what’s led to an all-or-nothing dynamic in automation. You either remake the entire warehouse so it’s regular enough for machines to understand, or you stick with humans, masters of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKcfVr"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ big claim is that Stretch will be able to bridge this divide. The company says the robot can be operated by anyone with just a few hours of training, and that its mobile base means it can slot into spaces designed for humans. Will it work? We’ll only find out once Stretch gets to grips with the job. Boston Dynamics says it’s currently looking for customers to pilot test Stretch, and is aiming for commercial deployment in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Tab A7 Lite leaks with budget looks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVWsOgJHOLE701KNB4gtm0EtQzM=/318x181:2742x1797/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041162/6f8ccd30a49e07d1d284f0e190931ac4e283a69c43cdd5908c07826cbb8ff5c0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7 Lite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-lite-1616956215-1805701457" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vegfzv"&gt;Images of Samsung’s unannounced Tab A7 Lite tablet have leaked, courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-lite-1616956215-1805701457"&gt;Evan Blass on&lt;em&gt; Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The images show a decidedly budget-looking device, with a single rear camera and no flash. Internally the tablet is said to be running a modest MediaTek Helio P22T processor paired with 3GB of RAM and a 5,100 mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2EYyz"&gt;The Tab A7 Lite is one of two “Lite” tablets Samsung is expected to launch in June, if a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1362336000387637252"&gt;February leak from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The other is the Galaxy Tab S7 Lite, which features a bigger 12.4-inch display compared to 8.7-inches on the A7 Lite, according to WalkingCat. &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-brengt-de-galaxy-tab-s7-lite-straks-uit-in-deze-opvallende-kleuren/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GalaxyClub.nl &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; the S7 Lite may be available with 5G or Wi-Fi-only connectivity, and that it could be powered by a Snapdragon 750G processor with 4GB of RAM. Available colors are said to include pink, green, black, and silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7DIfsK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/AJHLIKrOhY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AJHLIKrOhY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1362336216310448132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIZC7O"&gt;The two Lite tablets follow their full-fat counterparts from last year. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Tab S7&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Tab A7&lt;/a&gt; benefited from great displays and speakers, making them excellent for general media consumption. While neither were as well-suited to productivity tasks, that might not matter for the upcoming tablets if they’re priced affordably enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned BMW charges extra for a ‘don’t blind other people’ software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rl2rvx7sWJtEwRJcOMCNFr0CHYA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69040045/akrales_170313_1480_A_0336.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8ardg"&gt;When you typically think of luxury car features, do you envision rich leather seating and extravagant trim? Advanced cruise control and intelligent self-parking? Whatever you’re imagining, I’m betting “dim my headlights so I don’t blind other people” isn’t it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWPMfS"&gt;But not only has BMW used its “High Beam Assistant” as an upsell &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/united-kingdom/article/detail/T0013219EN_GB/bmw-announces-night-vision-and-high-beam-assistant?language=en_GB"&gt;for well over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also charging drivers &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; to unlock the safety feature that’s already built into their cars — by buying it as an over-the-air software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UegYrJ"&gt;Apparently, this has been going on &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/08/20/video-bmw-introduces-over-the-air-upgrades-for-certain-models/"&gt;for nearly two years&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Car Magazine&lt;/em&gt; editor Jake Groves brought it to my attention for the first time this week in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jakegroves/status/1374872023596417024"&gt;this viral tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ei3i5G"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For reference, this is the original pop up message I got on the system - couldn't snap it last night as I was mid-drive. BMW store says it's £160 for "unlimited" use... &lt;a href="https://t.co/zLbkuktEwV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zLbkuktEwV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Groves (@_jakegroves) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jakegroves/status/1375002783103995904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tjgKwX"&gt;Let’s forget the price for a moment, because that’s not what infuriates me. (In the grand scheme of things, £160 isn’t a huge amount for your average BMW buyer to spend.) It’s that &lt;em&gt;the rest of us&lt;/em&gt; are depending on BMW drivers being such good citizens that they’ll spend their own money to &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; showing off the power of their blazing headlights, all because a car company locked a perfectly good public safety feature behind a digital paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYhgu"&gt;Perhaps there should be a law about this? Don’t expect the US to move on that anytime soon, though; a different technology called adaptive beam headlights are &lt;a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/technology/a34417809/nhtsa-still-hasnt-ruled-on-adaptive-headlights/"&gt;actually still illegal in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, while we wait for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue a final decision on whether to even allow them, much less encourage their use. &lt;a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202004&amp;amp;RIN=2127-AL83"&gt;That ruling&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to come last year. I’ve asked the NHTSA whether there’s been any movement, and I’ll let you know what I hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Microsoft Flight Simulator mod features the cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obO0yn"&gt;The massive cargo ship Ever Given has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/28/world/suez-canal-stuck-ship"&gt;stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;, captivating the internet and frustrating the teams responsible for dislodging it and the governments hardest hit by the shutdown of the maritime trade route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZzE3Y"&gt;The ship (and its trademark “Evergreen” lettering painted on the side) has become so iconic, in fact, that it’s become a destination within &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, at least for one virtual pilot who appears to have created a mod that places the grounded vessel within the virtual Earth of the game,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/cargo-ship-stuck-suez-canal-shows-microsoft-flight-simulator-fly/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRyt7i"&gt;Twitter user Mat Velloso shared a video from TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@donut_enforcement/video/6944600483172551942?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowSX0XeT49TfTRlIDWRxg3g6t2lg9Zihh9bHS2F0VG10uco6J7WK%2F%2FocE%2F4Ec141fbGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAoH-du_eBDSCPaOby3Ck_T66ABwJ_VscOKDlIeoJLquR5Ror5ty0YSOXNXMEQv34Z&amp;amp;share_item_id=6944600483172551942&amp;amp;share_link_id=7B412BF6-71E3-4D43-9C86-E068D390C32B&amp;amp;timestamp=1616955896&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d639892k2h9402&amp;amp;user_id=6687206843449132038&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m"&gt;originally captured and uploaded by user “donut_enforcement,”&lt;/a&gt; showing off the the flyby of the cargo ship to a convincing-sounding pilot narration as the boat sits stuck between the banks of the canal. The scene looks shockingly realistic, which is a testament to the quality of the mod and also just the demanding visuals of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5atmB"&gt;Of course, there’s nothing stopping developer Asobo from updating the game with newer satellite imagery to include the ship for all players — there’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/satellite-images-of-ship-ever-given-in-suez-canal-shows-work-underway.html"&gt;plenty of such photographs&lt;/a&gt; having been taken over the last six days. But considering the game sources its imagery from Bing Maps and doesn’t always refresh in a timely manner, that means your game won’t have the Ever Given in it unless you’re able to mod it like in the video above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRJ2Va"&gt;There is currently &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-africa-middle-east-suez-canal-d73d015ffde50c3ddcffe4549e97d6ca"&gt;no concrete timeline for freeing the ship&lt;/a&gt; from its unfortunately angled predicament, so it’s certainly possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Stowaway, Made for Love, The Suicide Squad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RzePeb3jJ960IZDtHBPmhjrFyk=/262x0:1287x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69039079/stowaway.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_apvQkWsVY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCSxEu"&gt;I had to take a break from streaming &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt; because I’m about halfway through season 3 and I don’t want it to end (also it’s just too intense for a binge watch, let’s be real). But I just watched the first episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331604/netflix-the-irregulars-sherlock-holmes-watson"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; — loosely based on the Baker Street Irregulars from the Sherlock Holmes books&lt;/a&gt;— and so far it’s really good, especially if you are like me and appreciate seeing an established story retold from the point of view of another character (or in this case characters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9x0pb"&gt;A good batch of trailers this week, with that James Gunn movie everyone’s talking about and a Netflix flick about a group of astronauts headed to Mars who — surprise!— have an extra person aboard their ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGDyEN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nr9Z7b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the horribly beautiful mind of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JamesGunn&lt;/a&gt;. Watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheSuicideSquad?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheSuicideSquad&lt;/a&gt; full trailer online now. In theaters and streaming on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; August 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Available on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; in the US only, for 31 days, at no extra cost to subscribers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6wQNTtwDN8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6wQNTtwDN8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HBO Max (@hbomax) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1375477644431478786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C2wIcc"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MJfbLo"&gt;Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Viola Davis, and Sylvester Stallone (seriously the cast is huge) star in &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1EbSXxrZ34&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"&gt;The trailer is age-restricted&lt;/a&gt; (and the blank screen looked weird as an embed, which was why I went with a tweet of the video above instead) since the movie is rated R, so you’ll have to watch on YouTube after you verify you are old enough to watch a violent super villain movie trailer with a Steely Dan song playing in the background (which got the very old &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/suicide-squad-trailer-steely-dan-dirty-work-1234939275/"&gt;song trending&lt;/a&gt;). The much-ballyhooed, heavily anticipated &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h13oa5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_apvQkWsVY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lNONxG"&gt;Stowaway &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qS3dhZ"&gt;The three-person crew of a spaceship headed to Mars discovers an engineer unexpectedly (and unintentionally) has joined them. That’s problem one. Problem two: the ship’s life support system has been badly damaged and there’s only enough oxygen for three people. Dilemma! Anna Kendrick, Daniel Dae Kim, Toni Collette, and Shamier Anderson star in this space thriller (a bona fide genre now) that hits Netflix April 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ccO988"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvWgNSLIULw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EAuO9G"&gt;Made for Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LnPSQ2"&gt;This adaptation of Alissa Nutting’s novel tells the story of Hazel Green, whose controlling, creepy tech billionaire husband implanted a chip in her brain that lets him track her movements, feelings, and thoughts. Yes, I too shuddered to think how not-unlikely this scenario may be soon enough. Cristen Milioti stars as Hazel, and Billy Magnussen is husband Bryan, and (I guess for some comic levity?) Ray Romano plays Hazel’s father. &lt;em&gt;Made for Love&lt;/em&gt; premieres April 1st on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6YJK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pNObLJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gs-ODufnJ8Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iu17gS"&gt;The Nevers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CKp6PI"&gt;This is the first full trailer of the HBO Max series about a group of women in Victoria-era England who suddenly have unexpected super powers. If you’ve heard of it but aren’t sure why, it may be the off-screen problems with creator Joss Whedon.  He stepped away from the project six episodes in citing exhaustion (however, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/justice-league-ray-fisher-next-superhero-star-joss-whedon-snyder-2021-3"&gt;accusations of “abusive” behavior&lt;/a&gt; from actor Ray Fisher on the set of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, several actresses from &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; have since come forward saying &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/charisma-carpenter-joss-whedon-buffy-angel-accusations/"&gt;Whedon created a toxic work environment&lt;/a&gt; on that show). HBO opted to move forward with at least the first six episodes under a new showrunner and executive producer. &lt;em&gt;The Nevers&lt;/em&gt; will debut April 11th on HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the Amazon union vote is bigger than Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XiHO3k5C0le4-T2aqU-ykg4U8tk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038843/acastro_210208_4402_amazonVote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFX64V"&gt;For the last seven weeks, workers at an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, have been voting by mail on whether to unionize. Their ballots are due on Monday, March 29th, and counting will begin the next day. If the union wins, the warehouse employees would become the first members of Amazon’s US workforce to unionize, a momentous event at a company that has long aggressively resisted labor organizing, and one that could be a first step toward improving conditions at the country’s second-largest employer. Here is what’s happened so far and what might happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cMp3TD"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IaElX3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s voting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2vTQQ"&gt;The vote is taking place at an Amazon warehouse called BHM1 in Bessemer, Alabama, outside Birmingham. It opened recently, beginning operations last March, but by the summer workers had grown frustrated enough with conditions there that they reached out to the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which had a presence at nearby poultry plants and other businesses. By November organizers had gathered sufficient signatures to petition the National Labor Relations Board for an election, which is being held by mail due to the pandemic. In total, nearly 6,000 workers are eligible to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LddPJN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whhVMJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are they unionizing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LqhUEt"&gt;Employees say Amazon’s demanding and automatically enforced productivity metrics make work grueling, stressful, and dehumanizing. Amazon tracks two metrics: the average rate at which workers perform a task, called “takt time,” and how much time they spend not scanning items, called “time off task.” If workers fail to maintain a fast pace, they get reprimanded or fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCbHWB"&gt;“It’s hard to do, especially when you have a lot of big products coming,” said Perry Connelly, a worker at BHM1 who supports the union. “It got to the point where people started complaining about going to the bathroom and coming back and something being said to them about their takt time going up.” This is a common complaint among workers at BHM1 and other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;Amazon facilities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NXnI3"&gt;In an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said that “like most companies, we have performance expectations for every Amazonian – be it a corporate employee or fulfillment center associate, and we measure actual performance against those expectations.” Knox said performance is “measured and evaluated over a long period of time” and that “we support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.” Knox also said that workers “are allowed to grab a snack, water, or use the toilet whenever needed” but did not directly address workers’ complaints that they are penalized for doing so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBAZ7H"&gt;Connelly and other workers hope a union can improve working conditions and create a process around dismissals that feels less arbitrary. “I just want the people to get treated with respect,” Darryl Richardson, one of the employees to initially reach out to the RWDSU previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7RdzT5"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “I just want the people to get treated with respect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqQse"&gt;Workers also hope a union can negotiate higher pay. Many of the workers are acutely aware that Amazon has done stupendously well during the pandemic, with profits up 84 percent in 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2021/03/16/the-amazon-union-battle-in-bessemer-is-about-dignity-racial-justice-and-the-future-of-the-american-worker/"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ personal wealth&lt;/a&gt; rising by about $70 billion. Meanwhile, many BHM1 workers like Connelly have seen their wages drop: BHM1 opened in March, when Amazon had implemented $2 per hour in additional hazard pay, a program the company ended in June, dropping their pay to $15.30 an hour. “A lot of people are talking about the fact that he received billions of dollars in the pandemic from all his facilities, but he didn’t kick none of that money back to his employees who were actually working and in the trenches for him,” said Connelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2RGf5L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He didn’t kick none of that money back to his employees who were actually working and in the trenches for him”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HfFgDo"&gt;If the pandemic sharpened employees’ grievances, the Black Lives Matter protests last summer following the killing of George Floyd helped galvanize many to act. The majority of workers at BHM1 are Black, and many participated in the protests around Birmingham. The RWDSU has also &lt;a href="https://bamazonunion.org/why-rwdsu"&gt;framed the campaign&lt;/a&gt; as a matter of civil rights and racial justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btWldv"&gt;“A lot of the employees at Amazon are Black, and a lot are tired of being treated any kind of way, talked to any kind of way, and being treated like they’re less than anyone else,” said Connelly. “With Black Lives Matter coming in, it’s showing that you have a voice now — let’s do something with it. Right now, the union is another entity of that voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sah8m7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2YbZN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this a big deal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="By7rTb"&gt;Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the US, with 800,000 employees, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;fiercely resisted&lt;/a&gt; attempts at worker organizing. The only other unionization effort to make it to a vote was in &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-union/amazon-com-workers-reject-unionization-in-delaware-vote-idUKBREA0E1MM20140116"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, with a small group of repair technicians in Delaware, and it failed after an aggressive anti-union campaign. More recently, the NLRB found that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-nlrb/u-s-labor-board-claims-amazon-illegally-fired-warehouse-worker-idUSKBN28R319"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; workers who &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; the company’s handling of COVID-19. While the Bessemer effort would only organize a single warehouse, it would show that it can be done. Already, employees at other Amazon facilities have expressed interest in following in BHM1’s footsteps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJG8sv"&gt;“There’s a basic principle of organizing work that success breeds success, and that organizing often happens in self-reinforcing cycles of victory,” said Benjamin Sachs, a professor at Harvard Law School. “Organizing requires workers taking a risk, and the workers are more likely to take a risk when they see that the risk is going to pay off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vx2MSI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Success breeds success”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgaEKF"&gt;Such a chain reaction could do more than change the conditions that hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees work under. Because of its size and the sprawling geographic scope of its logistics network, the quality and pay of Amazon’s jobs have a powerful effect on the quality and pay of other jobs. Amazon itself has been touting this effect &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gj87/why-amazon-is-flooding-the-country-with-dollar15-minimum-wage-ads"&gt;in its ads&lt;/a&gt; lobbying for a $15 minimum wage, and indeed, a &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3793677"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that when Amazon raised its starting wage to $15 an hour in 2018, wages at nearby employers also rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko95sx"&gt;But when Amazon jobs are compared to &lt;em&gt;similar types of work&lt;/em&gt;, they come off much worse. Logistics jobs were historically a path to the middle class, and unionized warehouses typically pay double what Amazon does. When Amazon opens a warehouse, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/amazon-amzn-job-pay-rate-leaves-some-warehouse-employees-homeless?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; analysis&lt;/a&gt; found, wages at other nearby warehouses often drop. Amazon’s methods for worker tracking and enforcing productivity — aspects of the job that prompted BHM1 to unionize — have also spread across the logistics industry and other sectors as companies attempt to compete with Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI6wzt"&gt;Sachs calls Amazon a bellwether employer, for its outsize role in shaping the labor market and defining the future of work, similar to the role the auto industry played in the early 20th century. “The unionization of that industry, which had a lot to do with labor law reform, was a defining moment for the labor market for decades,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxdhaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UaKp2w"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What’s been Amazon’s response this time?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wYblfC"&gt;Amazon has been waging an aggressive campaign against the union effort, sending workers multiple texts a day urging them to vote no. It ran Facebook ads directing to a website that warned workers they would have to pay union dues (Alabama is a right-to-work state, and an &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/amazon-accused-of-anti-union-activities-through-website.html"&gt;NLRB complaint&lt;/a&gt; has been filed regarding the website.) Management put up banners on the walls and signs on the restroom stall doors with messages like “Where will your dues go?” and “Unions can’t, we can!” The company has brought in a high-priced &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/10/amazon-alabama-union-busting-koch/"&gt;union-busting firm&lt;/a&gt; and held mandatory meetings at the warehouse. “They call them training sessions, but all it was was union bashing,” said Connelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Otywk"&gt;Knox, the Amazon spokesperson, defended the company’s response to the union effort. “It is important that all employees understand the facts of joining a union and the election process,” Knox wrote. “We hosted regular information sessions for all employees, which included an opportunity for employees to ask questions, and educated through other channels as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xxull"&gt;The company has also employed more unorthodox measures. After losing its fight to have the election held in-person, Amazon sent employees mailers with instructions on filling out their ballot with a “no” vote and messaged them to deposit their ballots in a new &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anw9k/amazon-sends-vote-no-instructions-to-unionizing-employees-tells-them-to-use-new-mailbox"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt; installed at the warehouse entrance, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported. (Knox said “the mailbox was installed by the USPS and an option for convenient mailing to and from work but never a mandate.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kDGWEZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They call them training sessions, but all it was was union bashing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxAFr9"&gt;Employers have extreme structural advantages over organizers under US labor law, like their ability to hold mandatory anti-union presentations on company time while restricting non-work conversations and barring non-employee organizers from the workplace. Consequently, organizers are often left to canvass employees on nearby streets and sidewalks — or, in the case of BHM1, the parking lot as departing employees waited for the light to change. Then, late last year, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to change the timing on the traffic light. Knox said this was done to reduce congestion during shift changes, but organizers say it made their work harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py0VWg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CAL0Aj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do things look? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0dLtpE"&gt;It’s been a hard fought campaign on both sides. Organizers expect the vote to be close, though Connelly is optimistic. More than 3,000 workers had signed cards expressing interest in a union in the runup to the election, an organizer previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, more than enough to win if they all voted yes. However, given Amazon’s high rate of turnover, many of the workers who signed cards may no longer work there, and others may have been convinced by Amazon’s anti-union blitz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vl4oQw"&gt;In recent weeks, the union has been buoyed by a series of outside supporters, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/01/biden-amazon-union-video-472315"&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, who released a video message on Twitter last month alluding to the campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and activist and rapper Killer Mike visited the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-visits-bessemer-to-cheer-on-amazon-workers-union-effort/"&gt;warehouse on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the latest in a string of &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-amazon-labor/no-sense-of-job-security-amazon-union-organizers-tell-lawmakers-in-alabama-idUSKBN2AX19K"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/actor-danny-glover-comes-to-bessemer-to-show-support-for-amazon-union-push.html"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; delegations to Bessemer. The high-profile support has changed some minds, Connelly said, but the lengthy voting period means that some had already sent in ballots and had to request new ones to change their votes. “I think it’s a big swing around in the last month and a half,” Connelly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsMmVk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TaEtAd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens next? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2K2j3u"&gt;Ballots have to be received by the National Labor Relations Board regional office by the end of the business day on Monday, March 29th. Counting will begin Tuesday morning but it may be several days before we know the result as the NLRB adjudicates any challenges and objections brought by either side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGiiMw"&gt;If the union wins, its fight won’t be over. Companies often stonewall in negotiations over a first contract, requiring further public and political pressure from the union. “There are so many examples of where unions win elections, and eventually they walk away because they cannot get the company to bargain in good faith and to get to a first contract,” said Janice Fine, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EKyZr"&gt;If the union loses, attention will turn to seeds of activism the Bessemer campaign has sown across Amazon’s network. The fact that the workers at BHM1 have made it this far, Fine said, is already a victory, given the way US labor law and Amazon’s power puts organizers at a disadvantage. Getting to an election is a signal to unions that it can be worth the energy and expense of attempting to organize Amazon workers, and to workers that the risks they take might pay off. There are already signs that workers are taking that lesson from Bessemer. Since the campaign began, the RWDSU said it has already been contacted by over &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;1,000 Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; interested in unionizing. &lt;/p&gt;
