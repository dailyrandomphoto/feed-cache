    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azmsgz"&gt;Whether you’re gearing up for the back-to-school season or just looking for some extra charging kits to make your vacation go a little smoother, Anker’s latest discounts at Amazon might have what you’re looking for. There are a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/e735e735?showVariations=false&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_slot-15_69e1_dt_dcell_vai_1_e735e735"&gt;handful of products&lt;/a&gt; on sale, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Lightning-Powerline-Certified-Compatible/dp/B08G8NTVQ7?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_60&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a three-pack of iPhone cables&lt;/a&gt; (USB-A-to-Lightning) for $19.49 instead of $30, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Delivery-PowerPort-Outlets-White_Cable/dp/B08B7P7CJX?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_62&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a clever power strip with two outlets and three USB ports&lt;/a&gt; (two USB-A ports and one USB-C 18W PD port) for $26 instead of $36. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charger-Fast-Charging-Adapter/dp/B07YD77RKC?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_65&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 15W Qi wireless charging pad available for $20 instead of $30&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn’t include a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwOL8O"&gt;The niftiest device that’s discounted today is Anker’s Powercore Fusion wall charger-meets-battery pack. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-10000mAh-Delivery/dp/B08GKL41V4?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_61&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The black-colored GaN charger with a 10,000mAh battery within costs $34.50 today instead of $46&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you can charge devices up to 20W via USB-C or up to 15W when you use that port and the USB-A simultaneously, whether you’re connected to the wall or using the Fusion as a battery pack. It probably won’t be powerful enough to charge your laptop while you use it (unless you use something like a Chromebook), but it seems great for smaller devices and accessories. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306269/anker-powercore-fusion-usb-c-power-delivery-battery-charger-review"&gt;Check out Dieter Bohn’s review right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CNN plans to launch CNN Plus streaming service, but won’t say how much it will cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CNN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eN0Xib76RTF6B2x6z2I7IhrgdGE=/0x0:3438x2292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600462/1211180725.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1cn97"&gt;Cable news behemoth CNN said Monday it is joining the ever-crowded streaming marketplace, adding its CNN Plus service sometime in the first quarter, according to a press release. The new service “complements the core CNN linear networks and digital platforms to serve CNN superfans, news junkies and fans of quality non-fiction programming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giGL1n"&gt;Conspicuously missing from the press release was any mention of how much the service will cost, and a spokeswoman declined to provide further details. According to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company is still determining the price for CNN Plus, but there will be no ad-supported version of the service at launch. It will launch in the US only, and CNN expects to hire 450 people over the next six to nine months, &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bq5oY"&gt;The company says CNN will continue to have a single app where CNN Plus subscribers will be able to access CNN Plus programming. The app will include CNN’s linear television feeds, available to paid TV subscribers. If those subscribers want to “maximize their experience, they can also subscribe to CNN Plus, to access the full CNN Plus programming all in one place,” the release says. A CNN spokeswoman clarified that CNN Plus subscribers do not have access to the TVE feeds of CNN’s cable channels, and CNN Plus is a standalone direct-to-consumer product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY5FtH"&gt;CNN Plus will have original, live, on-demand, and interactive programming separate and distinct from CNN’s linear channels, the company says. At launch the service will have a “deep library of non-fiction, long form programming,” that includes past seasons of CNN shows like&lt;em&gt; Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;This is Life with Lisa Ling&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;United Shades of America&lt;/em&gt; with W. Kamau Bell. The service will add new original programming to be announced later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZEcsN"&gt;Andrew Morse, CNN Worldwide chief digital officer, will be the executive in charge of CNN Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Et7lh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spwoev"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia paves the way for RTX GPU Chromebooks with new Arm demo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYQCbZdKiyNVk5a0yMHHmTgwrdg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600347/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJpi77"&gt;Nvidia is working on expanding its RTX GPU support in a big way, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/"&gt;with a new demo at GDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; showcasing high-end gaming technologies like DLSS and ray-traced lighting running on Arm hardware for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1h9wx"&gt;Specifically, the demo shows off &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein: Youngblood&lt;/em&gt; and Nvidia’s “&lt;em&gt;The Bistro&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demo running on an RTX 3060 GPU paired with a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 Arm processor (&lt;a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-announces-new-mt8192-and-mt8195-chipsets-designed-for-next-generation-of-chromebooks"&gt;MediaTek’s flagship-level processor&lt;/a&gt; planned for a new wave of more powerful Chromebooks). Obviously, an RTX 3060 can run those demos on its own — but it’s the groundwork here that Nvidia is building that’s important because it’s offering the drivers and support necessary for them to run on Arm hardware specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43iAe3"&gt;In total, Nvidia says that its ported five RTX technologies to Arm and Linux: DLSS, RTX Direct Illumination, RTX Global Illumination, RTX Memory Utility, and Nvidia’s Optix AI-Accelerated Denoiser. SDKs for those tools for Arm with Linux and Chromium are either available now or will be available soon for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsgPqE"&gt;And while it’ll still likely be some time before you’re able to buy a Chromebook with an Arm chip and an RTX 3080 GPU, today’s news is an important proof of concept establishing that it’s both possible to add that support and that Nvidia is actually interested in building the tools and software necessary to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8GMgc"&gt;Of course, Nvidia &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a newly vested interest in making sure its GPUs play nicely with popular Arm-based systems like Chromebooks in the future, given its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;still pending&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;purchase of Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton plans to launch an in-app video game where you pedal to control a rolling wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3Jb2npjPRuV2gey-Td11xtcKX8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600097/Lanebreak___Gameplay___2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3S5OLB"&gt;Peloton is entering the video game business. Today the company announced its latest idea to get people to exercise: an in-app video game tentatively called Lanebreak. The game, which will only be available for Peloton bike owners and subscribers, involves riders changing their cadence and resistance to meet various goals and control an on-screen rolling wheel. Players can choose a difficulty level, the type of music they want to hear, and the duration of the track before starting. The game isn’t available yet, but a members-only beta will open later this year. Peloton hasn’t share details around how people will be able to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2brPO"&gt;The game’s vibe and interface reminds me of the Rainbow Road in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, with a track trailing off into the universe. It’s more or less the same on Lanebreak, except instead of controlling Mario, you’re pedaling to keep your tire moving and meet specific goals. There are three types of challenges and ways to earn points: Pickups, which means that so long as you’re in the lane that the game commands, you’ll earn points; Streams, which reward you based on your cadence; and Breakers, which reward you based on energy output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsJdq6"&gt;I only had a chance to test the game once on my bike, and personally, I found it boring and confusing to follow, especially compared to instructor-led classes. (I did a 10-minute class and was counting down the seconds until it was over.) However, this feedback also comes from someone who doesn’t play video games and prefers Peloton because of the various instructors’ personalities and music choices. But regardless of the game itself, the idea of a game for workouts is interesting and suggests Peloton is open to new types of content. It’s also especially interesting considering Netflix is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;also building&lt;/a&gt; in-app video games. It seems both companies see that they need various content offerings to keep people in their apps longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpjC82"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Boosted went bust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoCXiCZZY0LvV9jyD6K0AOQqzYI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599836/VRG_4668_The_End_of_Boosted_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An inside look at how the beloved electric skateboard startup fell apart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V2RgUj"&gt;Kanye wanted a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbP15Y"&gt;That was basically all a small group of employees at Boosted knew in early 2019 after they heard the rapper-mogul had &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/b03nvf/kanye_brought_his_own_boosted_board_to_the/"&gt;taken an interest&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s electric skateboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PqLzb"&gt;A partnership, an investment, an endorsement — whatever he was considering, a meeting with Kanye West seemed absurd. But then again, Boosted was also working on a secret project with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244818/boosted-boards-bikes-bullet-p2-scoot-little-ultimate-tony-hawk-birdhouse"&gt;skateboard legend Tony Hawk&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Was it really a stretch to think the startup could work with Yeezy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o6zNm"&gt;Apparently. Kanye spent the meeting — two, in fact, over the course of 2019 — focused more on his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/entertainment/kanye-west-domes-trnd"&gt;ultimately doomed vision&lt;/a&gt; for sustainable cities than he did discussing a tangible deal with Boosted, two former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. (Kanye could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qq7vna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted’s carcass is still drawing buzzards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRVVWj"&gt;At the time of the Kanye meetings, Boosted had outgrown its Kickstarter roots, and had defined the market for electric longboards — which had emerged as part of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d42G01gZNwI"&gt;a rideables craze&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-2010s. The brand was potent, but the startup was losing focus. It wasn’t just Kanye’s off-topic meetings, though some employees felt they were symbolic. Boosted was just spread too thin. It had launched half a dozen models — each with different configurations — in just six years, on a shoestring budget. Then it was hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21036805/boosted-board-electric-skateboard-finances-money-cash-trouble-customer-service"&gt;on goods made in China&lt;/a&gt;, and a delayed electric scooter, and eventually ran out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCKwMIfwQFTdw2qeQvZGoRb_FmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720509/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_3.50.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Kim Kardashian / Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3JN9Y"&gt;But while Boosted is dead, the beloved electric skateboard startup’s carcass is still drawing buzzards. Its biggest investor, the eponymous venture firm founded by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/martins-beach-vinod-khosla-california-silicon-valley-tech-lawsuit-2020-1"&gt;surfer-fighting billionaire&lt;/a&gt; Vinod Khosla, has spent the last year waging a pair of lawsuits against Lime in an attempt to reverse the scooter-sharing giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224164/lime-buys-boosted-electric-skateboard-scooter-acquistion-bankrupt"&gt;purchase of Boosted’s intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;. (Khosla Ventures is also an investor in Vox Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLLwRl"&gt;Khosla Ventures’ lawyers say Lime sabotaged a potential bailout of Boosted from Yamaha in late 2019 and conspired with Boosted’s biggest debt lender to rig the sale of the startup’s remains a few months later. Lime’s team has argued the powerhouse firm is simply raw about a “failed business negotiation” that ultimately couldn’t save a “dying business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqZrJG"&gt;The fight likely won’t end for months. (A trial is tentatively scheduled for May 2022.) But interviews with six former Boosted employees, as well as an examination of the lawsuits, help reveal in the greatest detail yet just how the category-defining electric skateboard startup fell apart, and why seemingly nothing — not a partnership with Tony Hawk, the constant support of one of YouTube’s biggest stars, or even Kanye West — could save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YlxgTn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rR2ChE"&gt;Things weren’t always so dire at Boosted. The startup was one of Kickstarter’s &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl"&gt;earliest success stories&lt;/a&gt; after it transitioned out of a Stanford incubator in 2012. A few years later, Boosted’s electric longboard became the go-to vehicle for YouTube star Casey Neistat. It seemed like in every vlog he posted, there was Boosted’s board: hanging behind him on the wall of his studio, or under his feet as he carved through Manhattan traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHBoRM"&gt;Neistat made Boosted so popular that it was hard for the startup to keep up with the orders that were pouring in. And co-founder Sanjay Dastoor attained cult status among the startup’s customers — not just because of the quality and popularity of the product, but because he was so hands-on that in 2016 he &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-talked-to-the-guy-whose-boosted-board-blew-up-1788560954"&gt;flew across the country to a board owner’s house&lt;/a&gt; to diagnose a battery failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbHBXF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted was a Kickstarter success, but it really blew up, thanks to Casey Neistat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6532mA"&gt;But Dastoor handed over the company to Jeff Russakow in 2017, a fellow Stanford grad. With that changing of the guard came new, much bigger goals. “The company is just doing splendiferously well, and we’re looking forward to an exciting roadmap of many new form factors of light vehicles and other cool stuff,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16212472/boosted-board-jeff-russakow-new-ceo-pivot"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Russakow told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he wanted to “be able to move faster on innovation,” and do “two major product releases of some cool exciting announcement” per year — “an Apple-like cadence,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iI6Bl3"&gt;Boosted rode this momentum for a while, and in early 2018 launched a second-generation board, along with a mini board and a high-performance variant called “Stealth” that eventually became its biggest hit. The startup then raised nearly $80 million by the end of 2018 from Khosla Ventures and others. In 2019 Russakow described that funding round &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as being full of “really supportive investors” who are “absolutely committed to the vision of the company.” He used the money to take Boosted global, expanding the brand into more than 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUWWDw"&gt;Boosted even started working with Birdhouse, the company run by perhaps the most famous skateboarder on the planet, Tony Hawk. The startup also discussed making a board for kids and tapped another pro skater, Andy Macdonald, to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRinPQfQZkw"&gt;work on the project&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted’s electric longboards had never really been a natural fit with skateboard culture, so validation from two of the sport’s icons felt, to some of the employees, like recognition of what they (and customers) already knew: that Boosted’s boards kicked ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zncfYv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New CEO Jeff Russakow took Boosted global — but that required more money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kVHq"&gt;By 2019, Russakow’s efforts to grow the company appeared to be working, too. It even drew interest from premium bike company Specialized, two of the former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKc4ao"&gt;But Boosted needed more money. The growth was eating up a lot of the revenue the company was generating in those new markets, and even cut into the money it had raised. Making matters worse, the company took a hit when then-President Donald Trump started a trade war with China. Boosted had outsourced manufacturing to China starting in 2016, and while Russakow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in May 2019&lt;/a&gt; that the startup had “the financial ability” to “eat” the tariff on the skateboards, it turns out that was easier said than done. (Boosted eventually applied for, and was granted, exclusions from the tariffs, but refunds for them were still outstanding when the startup went under.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvTwjb"&gt;The pressure of maintaining this pace of growth — which was coming from Russakow but also from Khosla Ventures, the former employees say — had Boosted running ragged. What especially tripped things up, though, was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;Boosted Rev&lt;/a&gt;: the startup’s super-rugged, $1,600 electric scooter that debuted in early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiGhg"&gt;Boosted announced the scooter just as its bank accounts started suffering, and almost immediately had to delay the rollout (in part because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20699803/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-injury-broken-finger"&gt;an issue with the latch meant to keep it folded&lt;/a&gt;, but also because scaling up production was tricky). Khosla Ventures and Boosted’s other backers had just put money into the company — they didn’t want to add even more. So in May 2019, Boosted quietly turned to a “venture debt” firm called Structural Capital for what it hoped would be short-term help. The deal’s terms weren’t exactly favorable to Boosted: it had to use all its assets as collateral for an $18.5 million loan. Plus, if Boosted missed certain payments, Structural Capital could take control of parts of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw4uO3"&gt;Boosted spent most of that loan in just a few months. So Boosted’s executives found themselves once again looking for money, just as the summer, their strongest sales period, was ending. In the meantime, Boosted started to delay payments to some vendors and began considering layoffs as early as September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7dpz64"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A desperate deal with a “venture debt” firm in 2019 proved poisonous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee1dXv"&gt;Khosla Ventures and another investor, Activate Capital Partners, made a small loan in October to help keep the lights on while Boosted looked for a way out, court documents show. But it wasn’t enough to stop Structural Capital from taking control of the company’s purse strings. Now every expense had to be run by the venture debt firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNIAJn"&gt;Employees quickly started to wonder how much longer Boosted had. The company no longer had access to its inventory, it stopped spending on advertising, and it certainly had no money to make any new products. Two former employees said they went on Thanksgiving break not knowing if there would be a company to go back to. That feeling of dread didn’t lift when they returned, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgUPPs"&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land,” one former employee says. Some employees banded together to figure out what other sacrifices could be made to save money, like getting rid of free snacks and lunches (which Boosted eventually did) or giving up their company-subsidized Caltrain passes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="llU2K7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KR4iKG"&gt;“The people at Boosted were great,” this person says. “Everyone felt very loyal to John [Ulmen, Dastoor’s co-founder, who remained with Boosted until the end] and wanted to stick it out. There was a lot of untapped potential with the brand. Everyone hung on longer than you’d expect because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm0Ovq"&gt;At one point in mid December, one team inside Boosted was incorrectly told by their manager that everyone would be laid off the following morning. “Everyone panics. Rumors start flying. People are making sure they have their stuff backed up,” says the former employee. But when Russakow called the company together that following day, he swatted the idea down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6ELX"&gt;By that point, word had gotten around that something was going on with Lime, but most employees didn’t know what. The confusion ramped up when employees started taking jobs at Lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs8T6T"&gt;“We would expect to get let go every Friday,” the former employee said. “Then paychecks would come through and people would be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JFdzrJ"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sETnzn"&gt;In the days before Christmas 2019, Boosted’s executives hunkered at their office trying to engineer a way out of a small mountain of debt — who to fire and what to salvage to keep the company alive. Suddenly, Russakow and his team received news that seemed like a Christmas miracle: Japanese giant Yamaha was interested in buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b82OBV"&gt;Those executives had already spent most of December hammering out a deal with Lime that would allow the scooter-sharing giant to hire away a small group of core Boosted employees and license some of the intellectual property around their new scooter in exchange for $30 million worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Ow01G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Yamaha acquisition would have been transformational&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp0LX5"&gt;That deal wouldn’t save the entire company, though, and it wasn’t done. A Yamaha acquisition, on the other hand, would have been transformational. It could have buttressed Russakow’s efforts to grow the startup and expand into new markets — moves supported by Khosla Ventures, which was looking for big returns on its investment, the former employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl6vi2"&gt;A Yamaha deal could have helped Boosted diversify into new categories while shipping products it had waiting in the wings, like an electric bike and new versions of its electric skateboards. But Yamaha ultimately got cold feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cynpTx"&gt;The failed Yamaha deal is at the center of Khosla Ventures’ lawsuits, one of which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/khoslas-lawsuit-against-lime-shows-ugly-side-of-aborted-acqui-hires"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The Japanese conglomerate is never named in the lawsuits, instead referred to as the “Manufacturer.”) Khosla Ventures unequivocally blames Lime for Yamaha backing out in the lawsuits, which were recently consolidated into one case in San Francisco Superior Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr5qJK"&gt;Lawyers for the venture firm have argued that Lime poached Boosted employees while negotiations with Yamaha were ongoing — including the Boosted VP who was coordinating interviews with the people Lime might hire as part of that deal. Khosla’s lawyers also claim Lime coordinated with Structural Capital to freeze the startup’s bank accounts and force it into dissolution — effectively preventing the Yamaha deal. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gyVO9w"&gt;Lime “acted with malice by intending to cause injury to Boosted’s economic relationship with [Yamaha],” lawyers for Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717699/07411502.pdf"&gt;argued at one point&lt;/a&gt;. “Defendants engaged in wrongful, intentional acts designed to disrupt [Khosla Ventures] and Boosted from consummating an alternative transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQ3CS8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khosla Ventures accused Lime of sabotaging the Yamaha deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEAut7"&gt;This all amounted to “sabotage,” Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717701/07229626.pdf"&gt;claimed in court&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted was losing crucial team members and access to cash, killing the Yamaha deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzgHMp"&gt;Khosla Ventures claims there was another twist of the knife, too. Just before this all allegedly played out in January 2020, Lime had come back to Boosted with a revised offer: $15 million in company stock and more Boosted employees in exchange for the scooter IP. Khosla’s team said in court that this was more evidence Lime was up to no good: it struck up negotiations with Boosted under false pretenses in order to steal employees and other nonpublic information from a startup on the rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTlRZ0"&gt;Khosla Ventures and Structural Capital did not respond to requests for comment. A Lime spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1xKY"&gt;Khosla Ventures kept Boosted afloat through February with $2.4 million in bridge loans, but ultimately “decided not to fund Boosted any further” by the end of the month, according to one of the filings. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;laid off most employees shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEjr2H"&gt;In March 2020, Structural Capital moved to foreclose on what was left of Boosted. The venture debt firm wound up in control of all of Boosted’s assets since the startup had used them as collateral. Structural also had the right to liquidate those assets if Boosted violated any terms of the loan — something Khosla Ventures agreed to when that deal happened, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjDZbM"&gt;Structural set up an auction for March 17th. It sent out a notice earlier in the month, which Khosla Ventures received. But one day before the sale happened, the San Francisco area  received a shelter-in-place order, as an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. Khosla says it didn’t attend the sale in order to comply with the public health order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VVUfwu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says there are “zero factual allegations” in Khosla Ventures’ lawsuit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgaVek"&gt;The auction went ahead anyway. There, Structural bought the rights to the tariff refund Boosted was waiting on from the government — a value in excess of $5 million — for just $400,000. Lime walked away with all of Boosted’s IP and remaining assets in exchange for 62 million shares of its stock. Khosla Ventures, Structural, and Lime were supposed to split the proceeds of any sale. But Khosla Ventures says Structural set up a new LLC that bought some of the assets — a move designed to dodge this contractually obligated proceed split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9lv1J"&gt;Lime fought back hard against most of Khosla’s claims. During a hearing in the San Francisco lawsuit, one of Lime’s lawyers argued there was no agreement that Lime wouldn’t solicit or hire employees. He also said there were “zero factual allegations” in Khosla’s complaint to support the claim that Yamaha backed out because of Lime’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5tuY9"&gt;“Your Honor, I — this is, I think, a truly kind of… kind of a mind-bending, in some ways, complaint, because… [Khosla Ventures’] alleges that Boosted was gonna fire these employees; that Boosted was under financial distress; that it, you know, was defaulting under the loan security agreement; that there was gonna be this massive bloodletting,” Lime’s lawyer said, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717703/07537736.pdf"&gt;a transcript of the hearing&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, he continued, Khosla was trying to claim these employees were still valuable and that it held the right to take legal action against Lime for hiring them away. “It just simply doesn’t make any sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8w7Qt"&gt;“It is odd, I’ll give you that,” judge Ethan P. Schulman responded. But, he said, “odd things happen in the world and give rise to lawsuit[s].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UvLKR8"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YbhWkZ"&gt;Before the sale, the other shoe had finally dropped for employees in early March, when the building manager at Boosted’s San Francisco office was served an eviction notice. The company’s leadership told everyone to work from home, but just a few days after that, they laid everyone off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQgvr1"&gt;“We understand this news will come as a surprise to many of you, but unfortunately, developing, manufacturing, and maintaining electric vehicles is highly capital-intensive, and over the last year-and-a-half our business has faced an additional unplanned challenge with the high expense of the US-China tariff war,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;Russakow and Ulmen wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. (Russakow and Ulmen did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZbRQf"&gt;Most of the employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said they didn’t believe Boosted made obvious critical errors. Even the scooter, some said, could have been successful — especially if Boosted had survived through the first few months of the pandemic, after which the sales of bikes and scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt;. Lasting until the Paycheck Protection Program launched in April of 2020 could have, at the very least, bought a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFCS79"&gt;Instead, many of them simply blame Khosla Ventures and acknowledge that Russakow’s aggressive product goals were a reflection of the returns the big firm wanted on its investment. It was in pursuit of those goals that Boosted overextended itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrk3dO"&gt;In the days and weeks after Boosted’s downfall, some of the startup’s most loyal fans still held out hope that it could be resurrected. Every few days they would tweet at Casey Neistat, or Elon Musk, and beg for some sort of intervention — as if the right face with the right money would be able to untangle the legal knot tied around the remains of Boosted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gHinqw"&gt;It’s hard to blame them; after all, throughout its early years, Boosted defied expectations. It was a successful Kickstarter project that turned into a bona fide company, and basically helped create an entirely new category of vehicle along the way. But at its end, Boosted had evolved into something far more common: yet another Silicon Valley startup that struggled to meet ambitious goals set by the people who wound up running the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcrzW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added disclosure of Khosla Ventures’ investment in Vox Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US and allies accuse Chinese government of masterminding Microsoft Exchange cyberattack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhABMG"&gt;The United States and key allies have &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;accused the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt; for the first time of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks in the West. Attacks attributed to China include the recent Microsoft Exchange hack, a significant and widespread breach that gave attackers access to the email servers of an estimated 30,000 organizations in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GAMp7"&gt;The Microsoft Exchange attack was initially blamed on Hafnium, a hacking group sponsored by the Chinese state. A senior official in the White House told reporters in a briefing at the weekend that the US government had “high confidence” that the Exchange hackers were being paid by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5vCVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is accused of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yhLGN"&gt;“[China’s] MSS — Ministry of State Security — uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit,” said the official. “Their operations include criminal activities, such as cyber-enabled extortion, crypto-jacking and theft from victims around the world for financial gain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzVE4x"&gt;The accusation against China was made by the US, EU, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and NATO, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-19/eu-denounces-china-over-cyberattacks-that-hit-microsoft-server"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEebN5"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/pdf"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;, the European Union said these and other attacks were linked to hacking groups known as Advanced Persistent Threat 40 and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (these labels are used by cybersecurity professionals to track the activity of known organizations). The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) &lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the APT40 group had targeted “maritime industries and naval defence contractors in the US and Europe” while APT30 had attacked “government entities, including the Finnish parliament in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLPZzS"&gt;“The attack on Microsoft Exchange servers is another serious example of a malicious act by Chinese state-backed actors in cyberspace,” said NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester in a press statement. “This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, and alongside our partners we will not hesitate to call it out when we see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukWjBs"&gt;Cyberattacks and ransomware incidents have been on the rise in recent years, with gangs of hackers apparently targeting larger organizations. This year alone, hackers have targeted America’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;largest meat supplier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;a key oil pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, though in both cases the groups responsible are thought to be based in Eastern Europe, and most likely Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2A3IH"&gt;Russia was also blamed for 2020’s SolarWinds hack, which breached a number of US federal government entities, and to which the US responded with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385371/russia-sanctions-solarwinds-biden-white-house-putin-hack"&gt;new economic sanctions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwlCXX"&gt;However, today’s announcement includes no similar sanctions against China for its role in the Microsoft Exchange attack (though these could follow). “The US and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable,” said a senior White House official during a briefing. The US Department of Justice did, though, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion"&gt;announce&lt;/a&gt; criminal charges against four hackers sponsored by China’s MSS for “a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare in a least a dozen countries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XEKwT"&gt;The most notable aspect of today’s accusation is instead the broad coalition of countries that are publicly condemning China. It also the first time the military alliance NATO has formally accused the country of organizing cyberattacks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to Bose’s wildly popular QC35 headphones leaks early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmcCSFAxx27T58aX9v9Cw71D_m0=/0x1:1772x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599803/msedge_aSMXAeu0yk.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show a very similar pair of headphones to Bose’s existing QC35s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/A94437310" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMBN7e"&gt;Bose appears to be on the cusp of releasing a successor to its much loved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/22/12003094/bose-quietcomfort-35-headphones-review-bluetooth-wireless-noise-canceling"&gt;QuietComfort 35 noise-cancelling wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;, judging by the appearance of an &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A94437310"&gt;FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; for a QuietComfort 45 model, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124100.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5cDgT"&gt;It’ll be a significant release for Bose, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/5/11861356/bose-quietcomfort-35-quietcontrol-30-soundsport-announced-pricing"&gt;launched the QC35s five years ago in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and since then have only released a minor update with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/14/16308160/bose-qc-35-ii-headphones-google-assistant-leak"&gt;addition of a Google Assistant button&lt;/a&gt; the following year. It’s been so long that the QC35s still ship with a micro USB port rather than USB-C, which &lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;notes looks set to change with the new headphones. In the intervening years, Bose has released the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s kept the QC35s around as a more affordable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCjwqf"&gt;Otherwise, the pictures included with the FCC filing suggest Bose has stuck pretty close to its existing design for the upcoming headphones. That’s fine by us — the feathery light and comfortable, if slightly conservative, design of the QC35s doesn’t need fixing — since it’s the internals of Bose’s headphones that could use a refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="221DOG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNO91i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 flagship will launch on July 29th  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eP926GkIn4de4_9Pg1xUMqK_oWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599671/huaweip50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei has previously teased the design of the flagship’s rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ggIou"&gt;Huawei’s next flagship phone, the P50, is set for launch on July 29th, the company has announced via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/KpqpgD10d"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobile/status/1417032611587923972"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts. Writing on his own Weibo page, Huawei consumer group CEO &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1100856704/KpqvOEtsk?from=page_1003061100856704_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;Richard Yu&lt;/a&gt; said (via Google translate) that the phone would mark the beginning of “a new era of mobile imaging,” suggesting that Huawei may once again make cameras the focus of its upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4awyiP"&gt;The launch comes a little over a year since Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194248/huawei-p40-pro-plus-release-date-specs-price-features-camera-google"&gt;announced its P40 series&lt;/a&gt;, but the launch  of the P50 has been far from certain. US sanctions placed on the company over national security concerns have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;seriously impacted&lt;/a&gt; Huawei’s ability to produce its own Kirin chipsets, creating doubts about its ability to release new flagship devices. “For reasons you are all aware of, a launch date has not been set,” Yu said when he teased the design of the P50 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;during a launch event last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H2o60f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On 29th July, we will be unveiling our newest products at the HUAWEI New Flagship Products Launch. Stay tuned to find out more.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiveSmartWithHuawei?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LiveSmartWithHuawei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Be6dgSvOVh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Be6dgSvOVh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Huawei Mobile (@HuaweiMobile) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobile/status/1417032611587923972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FML29"&gt;These chip challenges, combined with sanctions that mean Huawei can no longer preinstall Google’s apps and services on its devices, have eroded Huawei’s market share. Globally it failed to rank in the top five smartphone vendors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;in the second quarter of this year&lt;/a&gt; (after being the biggest in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347685/worlds-biggest-smartphone-company-huawei-overtakes-samsung-canalys"&gt;same quarter the previous year&lt;/a&gt;), and even domestically in China &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;Oppo overtook it&lt;/a&gt; to become the country’s most popular smartphone brand in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bggC3M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 19th, 9:48AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Huawei’s confirmation on Twitter of the launch date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s colossal 1,000-inch MicroLED display has improved colors and a thinner design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cuAYsCh8HPPdC3UT5shBdV1vFBo=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599594/The_Wall_R5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall as a massive in-store display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05dFAz"&gt;Samsung is releasing &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-2021-the-wall-is-now-available-worldwide"&gt;a new version of The Wall&lt;/a&gt;, its massive modular MicroLED display. Measuring in at over 1,000 inches in size, the new “IWA Series” display is aimed at businesses and commercial applications rather than homes, and Samsung’s promotional images showcase it being used as a huge display in a retail environment. The display is available in “select markets” from today, but Samsung’s press release doesn’t publicly list a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ80Xu"&gt;Improvements for this year’s display include LEDs that are up to 40 percent smaller than last year, which Samsung says should lead to higher contrast and better color uniformity. The purity of The Wall’s colors has also been improved over the 2020 model, and Samsung boasts that it’s got a new AI processor that further improves picture quality and contrast, and removes noise. Docking connections have an improved, wireless design, and the display’s depth has been cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBH5vU7R-nvMxH9R7619vHeL2IM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22725701/The_Wall_R5_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall, now with smaller pixel and a thinner design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClbxlG"&gt;The display has an 8K resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate, and because it’s made up of modular panels, it can be arranged in a number of different configurations, including an ultrawide 15,360 x 2,160 16K resolution. Samsung says the new 2021 model can be arranged to be concave, convex, or installed in other positions like being hung, mounted to a ceiling, or installed in the shape of an “L.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94xZV7"&gt;The new IWA Series of The Wall is Samsung’s latest display to use its MicroLED technology, which relies an array of self-emissive LEDs to create its image, rather than an LCD layer like most traditional TVs. It means that the panels can create better black levels by turning off pixels entirely, similar to the effect you’ll see from an OLED TV but without OLED’s traditional limitations like the risk of burn-in and lower peak brightness than LCD panels. Samsung says its latest version of The Wall has a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, while the best of LG’s OLEDs still peak at under 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpYBsz"&gt;While The Wall is an attempt to sell massive MicroLED displays to commercial customers, Samsung has also started including the technology in traditionally-sized TVs for the rest of us. At this year’s CES it announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;110-inch MicroLED TV&lt;/a&gt;, and it later expanded this range &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-micro-led-tv-first-look"&gt;to include 76 to 99-inch models&lt;/a&gt;. These are still massive TVs, to be sure, but at least they should fit on a wall in your house, unlike Samsung’s colossal 1000-inch monster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent is buying British game studio Sumo for $1.27 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ANT FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP Blockchain CUP Alipay GOAL" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qf5237zlJGtWey4tSrrWeuRzKF4=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599544/1233863534.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccCh6s"&gt;Tencent has announced plans to buy British video game company Sumo Group for $1.27 billion. The Chinese tech giant already has an 8.75-percent stake in the developer, as &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-19-tencent-to-buy-crackdown-and-sackboy-developer-sumo-in-usd1-3bn-deal"&gt;Gamesindustry.biz reports&lt;/a&gt;, and the offer represents a 43-percent premium on Sumo’s current valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUogs"&gt;Based in Sheffield, England, Sumo’s well-regarded core studio Sumo Digital has carried out contract work for many of the biggest names in gaming. It developed Sony’s PlayStation 5 launch title &lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure&lt;/em&gt; and was the primary studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Crackdown 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox consoles and PC. In 2017 Sumo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15283820/snake-pass-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;released &lt;em&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/em&gt; for multiple platforms&lt;/a&gt;, its first foray into original IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AuiyWc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Crackdown 3 review: the Netflix Original of games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sqbVAV"&gt;“The three founders of Sumo, who work in the business, Paul Porter, Darren Mills and I are passionate about what we do and are fully committed to continuing in our roles,” says Sumo CEO Carl Cavers in a statement. “The opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn’t miss. It would bring another dimension to Sumo, presenting opportunities for us to truly stamp our mark on this amazing industry, in ways which have previously been out-of-reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esP0b3"&gt;Cavers says Tencent has “demonstrated its commitment to backing” Sumo’s client work, as well as its own original IP, so things are unlikely to change too quickly. The buyout does, however, give Tencent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358252/tencent-wechat-ban-trump-executive-order-consequences"&gt;yet another foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the international gaming industry, following prominent investments in companies like Epic, Riot, Activision, and Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uTWBD"&gt;“Tencent intends to bring its expertise and resources to accelerate the growth of Sumo both in the UK and abroad, supporting Sumo in the market for top-notch creative talent, and the UK as a hub for game innovation,” says Tencent’s chief strategy officer James Mitchell. “We believe the proposed transaction benefits all stakeholders, delivers compelling value for Sumo shareholders, while enhancing the Sumo business for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4Mbr"&gt;This would be the second billion-dollar deal involving a British game developer this year — EA completed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173732/ea-codemasters-buyout-agreed-price-need-for-speed-dirt"&gt;acquisition of racing game specialists Codemasters&lt;/a&gt; for a similar price in February.&lt;/p&gt;
