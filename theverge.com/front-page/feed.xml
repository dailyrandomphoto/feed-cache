    <title>Amazon’s secret home robot Vesta reportedly in ‘late-prototype stage’ of development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP-GzawSE8xB5RpNiMlpolysTv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940282/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ER5gJ3"&gt;Amazon appears to have reached the “late-prototype stage” in the creation of its secretive home robot codenamed Vesta, claims a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-lab126-vesta-project-grows-but-insiders-are-concerned-2021-3?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device has been under development for around four years and now has more than 800 employees working on it, says the publication. If the robot launches, it will be one of Amazon’s biggest and most ambitious new products, in the mold of the Echo, Kindle, and Fire Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OpWhX"&gt;Indeed, it’s comparisons to the latter device, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end"&gt;failed smartphone project&lt;/a&gt;, that seems to be concerning some of those involved in Vesta’s development. “People are very skeptical — we’re worried it could turn into another Fire Phone,” one of six anonymous sources cited by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; as “directly involved in the project” told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQGY0Pj6kVKelOmcDxD3YJTv-O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324194/dseifert_210219_4433_0012sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vesta is reported to have a built-in screen like some of Amazon’s recent Alexa devices. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ge2ujl"&gt;As with any unannounced device of this scale, there is an abundance of unanswered questions and uncertain details. The basic premise, though, is that Vesta will be an Amazon Echo on wheels: a voice-activated assistant that can navigate your home, respond to your commands, and interface with other smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ7d9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report contains a number of intriguing and speculative details, including the suggestion that the device is the size of “two small cats” — about 10 to 13 inches wide (your conversion may vary depending on your cats). The robot will reportedly be equipped with a screen, microphone, and several cameras. Additional features could include sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, and air quality; a “small compartment” for carrying objects; and a “waist-high retractable pole with a camera” which could be combined with machine vision tech to help users find items around their house like keys and wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_7f5sFnL4zzu944aChX1Jv84z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21906023/20200921_image_blog_flyingcamera_sidebyside_2910x1637_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon owned-Ring announced a home surveillance drone last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EuOCh"&gt;Vesta, which is named after the Roman goddess of the hearth, shows Amazon’s ongoing drive to embed its products in the heart of customers’ homes. Over the years, the company has launched a number of devices attempting to extend its reach into kitchens and bedrooms, from the discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/20/15840814/amazon-dash-wand-alexa-review"&gt;Dash Wand&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed users to order grocery products by scanning barcodes, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a mini-drone announced last year by Amazon-owned Ring that provides mobile surveillance around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gISqC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says Amazon has been developing Vesta as a “top priority,” but that early sales projections are modest. “Amazon could initially launch it as a limited invite-only product, similar to what it did with its fitness band Halo, according to these people,” says the publication. This could prevent the company from squandering resources on unsold-inventory. Even mobile robots won’t get up and sell themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon announces Z9 flagship mirrorless camera in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tb7woiZCzprr9pqUBW_CD9Azw8w=/1x0:892x594/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68939863/z9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4SLmd"&gt;Nikon has &lt;a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/0310_z_01.htm"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; development of the Z9, its highest-end mirrorless camera to date and the first in the Z-mount line that the company describes as a flagship. Actual details are thin, but Nikon promises that it will deliver “the best still and video performance in Nikon history” upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OKdut"&gt;From the single image released, the Z9 looks like a cross between the current mirrorless Z7 and the D6 full-frame DSLR, with a built-in vertical grip. Nikon says the Z9 uses a newly developed full-frame sensor and a new image processing engine, with support for 8K video “as well as various other video specifications that fulfill diverse needs and workflows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDFZMG"&gt;That’s about it for details so far, except that Nikon says the Z9 will be released in 2021. Nikon tends to announce the development of its highest-end cameras this way, with full launches following a few months later. The D6, for example, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848720/nikon-d6-announced-no-details"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; to be in development in September 2019, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134272/nikon-d6-specs-price-release-date-announced"&gt;full reveal&lt;/a&gt; happened in February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Of course John Legere bought an $888,888.88 NFT from Steve Aoki</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="john legere assets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HgXuscLvVcAvLl2ormpORzSXPfs=/97x0:912x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68939232/johnlegere_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ageKjQ"&gt;Of course John Legere, the former CEO of T-Mobile, has jumped into NFTs by spending $888,888.88 on one made by Steve Aoki, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/steve-aoki-john-legere-t-mobile-nft-music-1139134/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s nice to know he’s keeping busy after stepping down from T-Mobile’s CEO gig on April 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qk6Wo"&gt;The NFT in question is called “hairy.” It’s a 36 second-long video, featuring music — which &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/em&gt;describes as “soundscapes in harmony with digital animations” and I would describe as “if Darude were making music from inside a Game Boy” — and this visual:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEyIsF3LPr8_qa932wHVkKQcLPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358091/hairy___Carly_Bernstein_kr6a67_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Steve Aoki&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A portion of the &lt;/em&gt;Hairy&lt;em&gt; NFT.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3JS10D"&gt;Not only is Legere’s ownership of the video permanently embedded in the blockchain, but he’ll also get a screen in some acrylic that will display the NFT, &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/collections/aokitudiscoauction"&gt;as long as he doesn’t sell it in the next two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xv7yBKk8ZjGeQ9qx2Izsf5Jg560=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358191/pjimage___2021_03_05T155446.972_jvdsx2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Steve Aoki&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This display screen is also included in the package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pS6vDe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQfoN"&gt;Aoki is probably best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20835774/monsta-x-steve-aoki-k-pop-play-it-cool-youtube-future-of-music-dani-deahl"&gt;his music career&lt;/a&gt;. The NFT is the latest in a series of Aoki’s eclectic projects, which include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278140/steve-aoki-capcom-street-fighter-arcade-cabinet-clothing-line-remix-dim-mak"&gt;a branded &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II&lt;/em&gt; arcade cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mIydP1sQs"&gt;Samsung commercials&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, his collection of NFTs with Antonio Tudisco visuals brought in $4.25 million, with Legere’s purchase as the biggest of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlRndB"&gt;In a way it was meant to be: Aoki’s &lt;a href="https://thehustle.co/rocky-aoki-benihana-family-fortune/"&gt;father founded the Benihana company&lt;/a&gt; of restaurants. There is a Benihana in the Las Vegas T-Mobile Arena. Kismet, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will host another Unpacked event on March 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NVocjJD4ydVmghhKgbpxTkhpBBI=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938959/Galaxy_Awesome_Unpacked_Invitation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gcY3B9"&gt;Samsung has just announced an Unpacked event coming up on March 17th, 2021, its second for the year so far. The invitation calls the event “Galaxy Awesome Unpacked.” Between recent A-series leaks and the chaotic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLTrNq2MnBM"&gt;“awesome”-themed promotional video&lt;/a&gt; for last year’s models, it seems safe to assume that we’ll see the Galaxy A52 and A72 devices debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TVi4IB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0654Hm8Z6I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8RuIw"&gt;An entire event dedicated to unveiling midrange devices is a little unusual, but the leaked information we’ve seen thus far has pointed to Samsung taking these phones very seriously.  The A52 5G looks like it will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;monthly security updates&lt;/a&gt; — something Samsung has tended to reserve for higher-end phones — and spec leaks have indicated we can expect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;high-refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DINTpF"&gt;If nothing else, we can hope that Samsung will bring the energy from last year’s unusual video to keep the event entertaining. You can watch by tuning in to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung"&gt;Samsung’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; on March 17th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. And please accept our apologies for embedding last year’s ad for the A51 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rovc4Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLTrNq2MnBM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Security startup Verkada hack exposes 150,000 security cameras in Tesla factories, jails, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/inHr_fsnZrHH1aqPs9cQ7OiyZdI=/252x0:2397x1430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938588/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_5.07.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verkada&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0nG8k6"&gt;Verkada, a Silicon Valley security startup that provides cloud-based security camera services, has suffered a major security breach. Hackers gained access to over 150,000 of the company’s cameras, including cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses, Cloudflare offices, Equinox gyms, hospitals, jails, schools, police stations, and Verkada’s own offices, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfru9C"&gt;According to Tillie Kottmann, one of the members of the international hacker collective that breached the system, the hack was meant to show how commonplace the company’s security cameras are and how easily they’re able to be hacked. In addition to the live feeds, the group also claimed to have had access to the full video archive of all of Verkada’s customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9lYXV"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, a Verkada representative commented: “We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorized access. Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this potential issue.” Following &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s request to Verkada, the group lost access to both the company’s live feeds and archives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oaW5MN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Surveillance company harassed female employees using its own facial recognition technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zemcsr"&gt;The hack was apparently relatively simple: the group managed to gain “Super Admin”-level access to Verkada’s system using a username and password they found publicly on the internet. From there, they were able to access the entire company’s network, including root access to the cameras themselves, which, in turn, allowed the group to access the internal networks of some of Verkada’s customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAeRd4"&gt;Verkada prides itself on offering internet-connected security cameras, promising a Silicon Valley “software-first approach” to make security “as seamless and modern as the organizations we protect.” The cloud-connected cameras include a slick, web-based interface for companies to monitor their feeds and offer (optional) facial recognition software, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCQfHB"&gt;The company has also come under fire in the past for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees"&gt;accusations of sexism and discrimination&lt;/a&gt; after an incident in 2019 where a sales director used Verkada’s office security cameras to harass female co-workers by secretly photographing and posting pictures of them in a company Slack channel. In response, Verkada’s CEO offered members of the Slack channel a choice between leaving the company or having their stock options cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeJKxh"&gt;The list of clients that use Verkada is broad: in addition to companies like Tesla and Cloudflare, the group gained access to Verkada cameras inside Halifax Health, a Florida hospital; Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut; Madison County Jail in Huntsville, Alabama; and Wadley Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Texarkana, Texas. In addition to the camera footage, the group also says that it was able to access the full list of Verkada’s thousands of customers and its private financial information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is working on a ‘big overhaul’ of TweetDeck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_SC6qAIdw1nHUcZqMVu1BVqYA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938270/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3LjFHd"&gt;Twitter is actively working on a “big overhaul” of its TweetDeck platform, which lets you arrange lists and feeds into easy-to-read vertical rows, and it plans to share more about the project publicly later this year, product chief Kayvon Beykpour said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cJjf3"&gt;TweetDeck, as one of the oldest and originally third-party account management apps for the platform, hasn’t seen much in the way of design or major feature changes in years. The app launched 12 years ago and was acquired by Twitter in 2011, and it’s more or less still the same vertical grid viewer for your various Twitter feeds it started as. Mostly, Twitter has ported over new functions added to its main website and mobile apps while keeping the core TweetDeck design relatively static. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkCO0Z"&gt;That appears to be changing. Beykpour and the product team recognize they haven’t “given TweetDeck a lot of love recently,” and they’re actively working on a new TweetDeck they plan to show off later this year. It’s part of a broader push to improve Twitter’s developer tools and repair its relationship with app makers, with the latter being a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;longtime contention between Twitter and the broader software development community&lt;/a&gt;. (Beykpour’s answer doesn’t specify whether the new TweetDeck will be released this year or simply previewed for the public.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2tiyR"&gt;Here’s Beykpour’s full response regarding TweetDeck: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bk3Ek1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s newsroom runs on TweetDeck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tIZC"&gt;Beykpour: Totally. And we haven’t given TweetDeck a lot of love recently. That’s about to change; we’ve been working on a pretty big overhaul from the ground up of TweetDeck, and it’s something that we’re excited to share publicly sometime this year. And so that’s just an example of a Twitter-owned and operated service that we will continue investing in. We also, over the last five years, I think, haven’t given a lot of love to our developer ecosystem. A bunch of reasons for that, some missteps that we’d taken in the past, then also sort of prioritization. We are also changing that; in the last year and a half we’ve really stepped up both our commitment and follow-through on just innovating around the API again, getting the API back to parity from our own internal APIs that we use to build functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02daWV"&gt;I think we’ve got a lot of trust to earn back with developers, since we’ve made a lot of mistakes in the past, but it’s something that we’re actively investing in. We hope we’ll allow developers to build really awesome stuff around the Twitter ecosystem. One of the reasons why Twitter is where it is today is because of developers doing cool shit that we would’ve never thought to do. And so that’s something that we’re trying to do more of, not step away from. More to come on that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8H238"&gt;It’s not clear whether this new TweetDeck would feature a refreshed visual design, all-new features, or both. It’s also up for debate whether Twitter plans to eventually charge money for TweetDeck; a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report last month&lt;/a&gt; said the company was mulling over a premium version of TweetDeck it could attach a subscription fee for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUagC9"&gt;Whatever form the new app takes, it will be a breath of fresh air for TweetDeck’s longtime users (myself included) who would like, at the very least, a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd0cP7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats are gearing up to fight for net neutrality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senator Markey Holds Get-Out-The-Early-Vote Rallies" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSby1u0udz9ncCEivgbJbOlZyqY=/0x0:5098x3399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938112/1228227467.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxRPoP"&gt;A new bill to bring back net neutrality is on its way, supported by one of the open internet’s most fervent advocates. At an advocacy event last month, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) announced that he would be introducing a measure in the next few “weeks” that would engrave the no throttling, block, or paid fast lanes rules into law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fxgm0"&gt;Reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, Markey reaffirmed his commitment to introducing a bill soon. “The coronavirus pandemic has proven that broadband is as essential as electricity and other utilities. We need to restore net neutrality protections to ensure that our internet remains open and free and that consumers can continue to benefit from this critical infrastructure,” Markey told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBjG6i"&gt;Legislation like Markey plans to introduce could finally put the debate over net neutrality to rest and secure open internet protections for Americans under Title II for good, immune from the back-and-forth of the Tom Wheeler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;and Ajit Pai orders&lt;/a&gt;. Net neutrality has more of a chance than ever with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House. But with a razor-thin majority in the Senate and most Republicans still firmly opposed, net neutrality legislation still faces a delicate path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4nhZQ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Net neutrality has more of a chance than ever with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFe8UD"&gt;Markey and his compatriots in the House have already seen some success in legislative efforts to revive the rules. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;Markey’s Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in the House by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA), was approved by a significant margin, but was never taken up in the Senate under former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) leadership. Another measure, through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357592/net-neutrality-senate-vote-cra-reinstate-fcc-rules"&gt;received a 52-47 vote&lt;/a&gt; to overturn the Pai Federal Communications Commission’s rollback of the rules. Three Republicans, Sens. John Kennedy (R-LA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME), all voted on a measure to bring back the rules, signaling that there could be some bipartisan support for a new bill in the Senate as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7qdLy"&gt;But the window for another CRA vote has long since passed, making it more difficult for Democrats to find the votes necessary to approve net neutrality legislation in the Senate. There are also Senate Democrats who could vote against a bill. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) was part of a working group with Sen. Roger Wicker (R-LA) in previous congresses that sought to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/3/wicker-and-sinema-announce-net-neutrality-working-group"&gt;bill to bridge the partisan divide&lt;/a&gt;. No bill ever came out of that group, but it would likely include net neutrality’s three brightline rules: no throttling, blocking, or paid prioritization of web traffic. But without Title II, an FCC classification that gives the commission more authority to regulate broadband, a bill would be a nonstarter for many Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTdlG"&gt;“It’s not just about net neutrality that’s about closing the digital divide that it’s about making sure that broadband is affordable and accessible to everyone that it’s reliable. Right now the FCC can’t do any of that,” Chris Lewis, the president and CEO of Public Knowledge, said Monday of Title II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pqdSWS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not just about net neutrality that’s about closing the digital divide”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SMorSl"&gt;If a legislative solution isn’t viable, Democrats are preparing to pressure the FCC to take measures into their own hands (again). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Markey said, “Once we have three Democrats in place at the Federal Communications Commission, I will strongly urge it to reverse the Trump FCC’s wrongheaded decision and restore net neutrality and the FCC’s authority over broadband.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZY74S"&gt;By appointing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt; to lead the FCC in the interim in January, President Biden signaled that he would approve of a net neutrality advocate chairing the commission. But the FCC is currently gridlocked with two Democrats and two Republicans, making it impossible for it to move forward on open internet rules. As of Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/03/09/scoop-biden-taps-another-big-tech-trustbuster-492042"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Biden has selected Lina Khan, an anti-monopoly researcher and expert, to join the Federal Trade Commission. This nomination, once confirmed, would bring the FTC back to a working majority, potentially signaling that the FCC could be next in line for a nomination. Activists are already lining up to ensure that Biden’s pick for the next FCC commissioner won’t have any ties to the telecom industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4jI4n"&gt;“The first battle is ensuring that whoever the Biden administration nominates for that fifth position that the FCC is someone who’s a real fighter, who’s going to stand up and make sure that the FCC is an agency that is protecting people’s basic right to connect to the internet safely affordably,” Evan Greer, deputy director for Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfAIqb"&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding its FCC nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amju8a"&gt;Still, any measure that would put net neutrality rules back in place at the FCC would be subject to yet another reversal under a new Republican-led administration in the next few years, making it even more important for Congress to try to find a solution. State laws are also beginning to go into effect. Last month, a federal judge ruled that California could begin enforcing its state’s net neutrality law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGeiqa"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-2021-legislation.aspx"&gt;nine states&lt;/a&gt; have introduced some form of net neutrality legislation this year. If more of these laws are approved, it could make legislating at the federal level even more of a challenge with Republicans seeking to make those laws moot through preemption. This momentum in the states could force both Republicans and Democrats to get serious about net neutrality legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lobqes"&gt;“I think it shows real momentum,” Greer said of the California decision. “It certainly opens the door for other states to follow California’s lead and I think we will see that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJOjt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Roam officially announced for $169, preorders start now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RogTuxUZq_6AqOHo_f9EI96BTEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937910/Roam1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rALqmP"&gt;There wasn’t much left that we didn’t already know, but today, Sonos has officially announced its latest speaker, the Sonos Roam. Just as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, the Roam is a portable battery-powered speaker priced at $169. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeSonosRoamAnnounced03092021/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders start today,&lt;/a&gt; and it will go on sale on April 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuy09O"&gt;The Sonos Move was the company’s first try at a portable product, but it’s quite large and hefty to actually travel with. The Roam, however, is a true “bring it anywhere” speaker. It’s the smallest speaker that Sonos has ever made, though the measurements I gave you last week were a hair off. It’s actually 6.61 x 2.44 x 2.36 inches and weighs 0.95 pounds. Sonos told me it considered “hundreds” of different sizes and prototypes before landing on this design. With dimensions like that, the big question is whether the Roam can live up to the reputation Sonos has established for good sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvgqR15-vT6hbkrJGYjNlgkztgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355745/Top_Detail.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tCjXhl"&gt;I haven’t heard the thing firsthand, so I can’t yet say how it compares to a UE Boom, JBL Charge, or one of Bose’s portable speakers. Sonos has packed the Roam with “two Class-H amplifiers.” There’s a tweeter for high frequencies and a “custom racetrack” mid-woofer — similar in shape to what’s in the Arc soundbar — that “ensures faithful playback of mid-range frequencies and maximizes low-end output.” It’s not a 360-degree design like some Bluetooth speakers, but Sonos says this is intentional and that the Roam fires audio where it makes the most sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0F5L0"&gt;Here’s how everything fits together:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CB9ZCZpeqVaiNXKbpLlHLFKKJg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354858/SonosRoamExplode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrsuni"&gt;Sonos is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price"&gt;bringing automatic Trueplay to the Roam&lt;/a&gt;, so it will tune audio output for the best results based on whatever room or environment that the speaker is in. (It does this by using the built-in mics, which are also there for the purpose of hands-free Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.) Two Roams can be set up as a stereo pair over Wi-Fi, but unfortunately, this option isn’t available when you’re playing music over Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLqqyy"&gt;Unlike the Move, which made you choose between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modes, the Roam takes advantage of both connections at once. It’ll join your Wi-Fi network automatically and then repair to your phone (also automatically) once you take it away from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlkjJ8"&gt;You can play something from your phone with Bluetooth on the Roam and extend it across your whole multiroom Sonos system. (Yes, the company confirmed to me that this is also an easy way to get Bluetooth-enabled turntables playing on all your Sonos speakers.) Apple’s AirPlay 2 is also supported, and as always, you can play audio from a ton of services through the Sonos mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caOe3CB_VSkW-dNa6dlm-bxh7RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355764/RoamCamp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6RSiC"&gt;The Roam can last for up to 10 hours of audio playback on a charge, and a USB-C charging cable comes in the box. As I said last week, Sonos is also selling a wireless charging stand — the Roam attaches to it magnetically — but you can use any Qi wireless charger that will fit the speaker when it’s standing up, so that’s nice. When not in use, the Roam can last for up to 10 days of standby time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIDiLw"&gt;Like the Move before it, Sonos says the Roam has been put through a ton of durability tests. The speaker has silicone at both ends to help protect it when dropped. It’s rated IP67 for dust and water resistance, so it can survive baths in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDMbm0"&gt;Another neat Roam trick is called Sound Swap. Just hold the play / pause button on the top for three seconds, and the Roam will pass the music it’s playing to whatever other Sonos speaker in your system is closest. The way Sonos achieves this is clever: when Sound Swap is activated, all of your Sonos speakers will emit a high-pitched frequency that people (and dogs, I’m told) can’t hear. This is how the Roam figures out which one is nearby. This type of handoff could prove useful for an eventual, long-rumored set of Sonos noise-canceling headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beyZqv"&gt;The Roam seems like a compelling product for Sonos, and I’ve already seen a lot of excitement about a variety of use cases. Is it the perfect bathroom speaker? The ideal speaker for tossing into your bag when traveling? Taking to the beach or park? A ton hinges on how good it sounds for $169. For that verdict, stay tuned for our full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC may be teasing the release of a VR lip tracker for Vive headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJH4bFrXDjGmEo0Mopm5FU3YGfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937812/akrales_191003_3707_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmNamF"&gt;HTC may be teasing new modules and attachments for its Vive virtual reality headsets, including a lip tracker, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-lip-tracking-tease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl1qJx"&gt;HTC’s been building up to some kind of announcement on its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htcvive"&gt;Vive Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; over the last week. Yesterday, it posted an image of a hinge, which savvy Twitter users matched to an experimental lip tracking module HTC announced at the Game Developers Conference in 2019. You can see a picture of the hinged product HTC is teasing and a matching photo of its lip tracking device below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wFix8c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Pl6Z5eojD4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pl6Z5eojD4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rλmes VR (@vr_rames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vr_rames/status/1369018088587419653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wq6u1"&gt;At the time, the company said it was using the module for research and experimentation, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/htc-vive-pro-lip-tracking-module-gdc-2019/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Road to VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Combined with the eye tracking HTC’s already integrated into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655871/htc-vive-pro-eye-vr-headset-eye-tracking-price-release-us-canada"&gt;Vive Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt;, it offers an early picture of what full face tracking looks like in VR. Some developers have gotten their hands on that earlier version of the lip tracker and integrated into social VR apps like &lt;a href="https://neos.com/"&gt;NeosVR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AMKm5k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukKHVYwzZRA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XgmAnL"&gt;Hand, face, and eye tracking features play a large part in making avatars move and appear “natural” in VR. The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and Quest headsets already offer hand tracking as a control method, but face tracking (enabled by an attachment or eventually new headset designs) could prove to be a boon in social VR settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmnlqX"&gt;Facebook was already experimenting with face tracking for Oculus headsets in 2019, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/frl-multiview-face-tracking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In a recent interview, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also reiterated how important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;realistic avatars&lt;/a&gt; — animated with face and eye tracking — are to his vision of the future of VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzuKoC"&gt;HTC hasn’t actually confirmed that it’s releasing a version of its lip tracking module to the public. But either way, getting comfortable with headsets sensing you as much as they do your surroundings seems like it’s in the cards for VR enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmJRvG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: T-Mobile will start sharing customer info with advertisers unless you opt out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kI5Iqa2CQKwkctUCqH1NRDzHl3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937654/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will soon start sharing certain customer data with marketers to provide more relevant ads. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZ741t"&gt;T-Mobile will soon put a new privacy policy into effect that will allow it to share certain kinds of customer information with third-party advertisers. Starting on April 26th, 2021, all customers will be automatically opted in to the new program, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Customers who don’t want to participate will need to manually opt out using their accounts’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0R5BD"&gt;T-Mobile’s new policy is no different than &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/privacy/overview.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-32&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt;. This is an about-face for former Sprint customers, however. T-Mobile acknowledges in its announcement of the policy change that Sprint offered a similar opt-&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; service rather than an opt-out one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pYDROX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies say the data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mHh4aS"&gt;The new policy includes the same kind of provisions as AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for sharing user data with third-party marketers in the name of providing more relevant advertising. The companies say that data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities and that they don’t share information that’s associated with a child’s device or service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppHqnT"&gt;As harmless as the carriers make this practice sound, it’s something people are growing increasingly wary of. As a response, companies like Google are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;working to make their data-gathering and sharing practices less intrusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncN7JZ"&gt;If you’re not wild about your carrier sharing data about you with advertisers, it’s easy enough to opt out of these services. AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out of third-party data sharing by accessing their account’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fcmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, Verizon customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fverizonwireless.com%2Fmyprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;log in to My Verizon to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of what it calls “Relevant Mobile Advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;
