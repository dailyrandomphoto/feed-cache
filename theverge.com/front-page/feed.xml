    <title>Microsoft has built an AI-powered autocomplete for code using GPT-3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5IAAG1NfIUw9AMjc_Srg_IaitU=/0x12:503x347/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339291/microsoft_gpt3_powerapps_code.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B5jsjU"&gt;In September 2020, Microsoft purchased an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusive license&lt;/a&gt; to the underlying technology behind GPT-3, an AI language tool built by OpenAI. Now, the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant has announced its first commercial use case for the program: an assistive feature in the company’s PowerApps software that turns natural language into readymade code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gICEYz"&gt;The feature is limited in its scope and can only produce formulas in &lt;a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-power-fx-the-low-code-programming-language-for-everyone/"&gt;Microsoft Power Fx&lt;/a&gt;, a simple programming language derived from Microsoft Excel formulas that’s used mainly for database queries. But it shows the huge potential for machine learning to help novice programmers by functioning as an autocomplete tool for code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="om6Q70"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t we ... speak the language of a normal human?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQGv5x"&gt;“There’s massive demand for digital solutions but not enough coders out there. There’s a million-developer shortfall in the US alone,” Charles Lamanna, CVP of Microsoft’s Low Code Application Platform, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So instead of making the world learn how to code, why don’t we make development environments speak the language of a normal human?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="33mvCV"&gt;Autocomplete for coders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rVoF8A"&gt;Microsoft has been pursuing this vision for a while through Power Platform, its suite of “low code, no code” software aimed at enterprise customers. These programs run as web apps and help companies that can’t hire experienced programmers tackle basic digital tasks like analytics, data visualization, and workflow automation. GPT-3’s talents have found a home in PowerApps, a program in the suite used to create simple web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVgYag"&gt;Lamanna demonstrates the software by opening up an example app built by Coca-Cola to keep track of its supplies of cola concentrate. Elements in the app like buttons can be dragged and dropped around the app as if the users were arranging a PowerPoint presentation. But creating the menus that let users run specific database queries (like, say, searching for all supplies that were delivered to a specific location at a specific time) requires basic coding in the form of Microsoft Power Fx formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBkR0q"&gt;“This is when it goes from no code to low code,” says Lamanna. “You go from drag and drop, click click click, to writing formulas. And that quickly becomes complex.” Which makes it the right time to call for an assist from machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qu6ZYr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Microsoft GPT-3 PowerApps demo|102277" data-volume-uuid="911690cf4" data-volume-id="102277" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-171" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PeIUvy"&gt;Instead of having users learn how to make database queries in Power Fx, Microsoft is updating PowerApps so they can simply write out their query in natural language, which GPT-3 then translates into usable code. So for example, instead of a user searching the database with a query “FirstN(Sort(Search(‘BC Orders’, “Super_Fizzy”, “aib_productname”), ‘Purchase Date’, Descending), 10),” they can just write “Show 10 orders that have Super Fizzy in the product name and sort by purchase date with newest on the top,” and GPT-3 will produce the correct the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BMxB8"&gt;It’s a simple trick, but it has the potential to save time for millions of users, while also enabling non-coders to build products previously out of their reach. “I remember when we got the first prototype working on a Friday night, I used it, and I was like ‘oh my god, this is creepy good,’” says Lamanna. “I haven’t felt this way using technology for a long, long time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTK6gT"&gt;The feature will be available in preview in June, but Microsoft is not the first to use machine learning in this way. A number of AI-assisted coding programs have appeared in recent years, including some, like Deep TabNine, that are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708542/coding-autocompleter-deep-tabnine-ai-deep-learning-smart-compose"&gt;powered by the GPT series&lt;/a&gt;. These programs show promise but are not yet widely used, mostly due to issues of reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t46xHs"&gt;Programming languages are notoriously fickle, with tiny errors capable of crashing entire systems. And the output of AI language models is often haphazard, mixing up words and phrases and contradicting itself from sentence to sentence. The result is that it often requires coding experience to check the output of AI coding autocomplete programs. That, of course, undermines their appeal for novices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LMbVAP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simplicity of Power Fx is its greatest strength in this scenario&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPmdiW"&gt;But Microsoft’s implementation has one big advantage over other systems: Power Fx is extremely simple. The language has its roots in Microsoft Excel formula, explains Lamanna, and is very constrained in what it can do. “It’s data-binding, single-line expressions; there’s no concept of build and compile. What you write just computes instantly,” he says. It has nothing like the power or flexibility of a programming language like Python or JavaScript, but that also means it doesn’t have as much room to commit AI-assisted errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX3r7w"&gt;As an additional safeguard, the Power Apps interface will also require that users confirm all Power Fx formulas generated from their input. Lamanna argues that this will not only reduce mistakes, but even teach users how to code over time. This seems like an optimistic read. What’s equally likely is that people will unthinkingly confirm the first option they’re given by the computer, as we tend to do with so many pop-up nuisances, from cookies to Ts&amp;amp;Cs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RP8yjy"&gt;Mitigating bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F1LDgy"&gt;The feature accelerates Microsoft’s “low code, no code” ambitions, but it’s also noteworthy as a major commercial application of GPT-3, one of a new breed of AI language models that dominate the contemporary AI landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CpsE1"&gt;These systems are extremely powerful, able to generate virtually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;any sort of text&lt;/a&gt; you can imagine and manipulate language in a variety of ways, and many big tech firms have begun exploring their possibilities. Google has incorporated its own language AI model, BERT, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;into its search products&lt;/a&gt;, while Facebook uses similar systems for &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/first-multilingual-machine-translation-model"&gt;tasks like translation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AfZSob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One medical chatbot built on GPT-3 told a mock patient to kill themself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DEN7mr"&gt;But these models also have their problems. The core of their capacity often comes from studying language patterns found in huge vats of text data scraped from the web. As with Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist"&gt;chatbot Tay&lt;/a&gt;, which learned to repeat the insulting and abusive remarks of Twitter users, that means these models have the ability &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;to encode and reproduce&lt;/a&gt; all manner of sexist and racist language. The text they produce can also be toxic in unexpected ways. One experimental chatbot built on GPT-3 that was designed to dole out medical advice &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/28/gpt3_medical_chatbot_experiment/"&gt;consoled a mock patient by telling them to kill themself&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gd5aG"&gt;The challenge of mitigating these risks depends on the exact function of the AI. In Microsoft’s case, using GPT-3 to create code means the danger is low, says Lamanna, but not nonexistent. The company has fine-tuned GPT-3 to “translate” into code by training it on examples of Power Fx formula, but the core of the program is still based on language patterns learned from the web, meaning it retains this potential for toxicity and bias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRI23"&gt;Lamanna gives the example of a user asking the program to find “all job applicants that are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.” How will it interpret that command? It’s within GPT-3’s power to invent criteria in order to answer the question, and it’s possible it might assume that “good” is synonymous with white-sounding names, given that this is one of a number of categories favored by &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/employers-replies-racial-names"&gt;biased hiring practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3IgE9"&gt;Microsoft says it’s addressing this issue in a number of ways. The first is implementing a ban list of words and phrases that the system just won’t respond to. “If you’re poking the AI to generate something bad, we’re not going to generate it for you,” says Lamanna. And if the system produces something it &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; might be problematic, it’ll prompt users to report it to tech support. Then, someone will come and register the problem (and hopefully fix it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOJx6x"&gt;But making the program safe without limiting its functionality is difficult, says Lamanna. Filtering by race, religion, or gender can be discriminatory, but it can also have legitimate applications, and it sounds like Microsoft is still working out how to tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tlKpC2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Like any filter, it’s not perfect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQdRla"&gt;“Like any filter, it’s not perfect,” says Lamanna, emphasizing that users will have to confirm any formula written by the AI, and implying that any abuses of the program will ultimately be their responsibility. “The human does choose to inject the expression. We never inject the expression automatically,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STkoqf"&gt;Despite these and other unanswered questions about the program’s utility, it’s clear that this is the start of a much bigger experiment for Microsoft. It’s not hard to imagine a similar feature being integrated into Microsoft Excel, where it would reach hundreds of millions of users and dramatically expand the accessibility of this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oeveP"&gt;When asked about this possibility, Lamanna demures (it’s not his domain), but he does say that the plan is to make GPT-3-assisted coding available wherever Power Fx itself can be accessed. “And Power Fx is showing up in lots of different places in Microsoft products,” he says. So expect to see AI completing your code much more frequently in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson is returning to space — this time, on a private ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7uewe7m0xyMh_cm0nSHhnte40s=/388x0:4540x2768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339271/51193870203_bf4f7763b6_o.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is seen docked to the International Space Station on May 5th, 2021, shortly before returning four astronauts back to Earth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / Johnson Space Center&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zY4FIe"&gt;Peggy Whitson, one of NASA’s most experienced retired astronauts, is going back to space — this time with a racecar driver and two other passengers in the latest mission planned by Axiom Space. The Houston-based space company announced on Tuesday that Whitson will serve as the mission commander for its second private flight to the International Space Station, with John Shoffner, a GT racer, serving as mission pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPCq2s"&gt;The Ax-2 mission with Whitson and Shoffner will be similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;Ax-1&lt;/a&gt;, Axiom’s first planned flight for early next year: a crew of four private citizens will fly to the International Space Station for a roughly eight-day stay conducting scientific research. It’s the latest private spaceflight planned so far as companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic race to offer tourists a trip to space — either to the ISS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358313/spacex-crew-dragon-glass-dome-window-space-tourists"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448928/virgin-galactic-spaceplane-vss-unity-space-branson"&gt;edge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445585/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-millions-auction-bid"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggcTNJ"&gt;Axiom serves as a mission manager that procures other companies’ spacecraft to fly people to space, charging passengers somewhere around $55 million per mission if it’s on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule and probably more if it’s on Boeing’s Starliner capsule, which has yet to be flight-certified by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5jDmRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whitson didn’t think she’d go back to space after retiring in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48ujWk"&gt;Whitson, 61, has tallied 665 days in space across three missions, the most for any NASA astronaut. She and Shoffner have been training as backups for Ax-1, which is slated to launch three entrepreneurs and former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría to the ISS in January 2022. That flight will use SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which has flown three crews of government astronauts to the ISS since May last year under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The ride for Ax-2 hasn’t been confirmed yet, Axiom says, and the two other Ax-2 crewmates are still being sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRAPdDp94ho5T9raTydvdultQmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538075/Ax2_Group_Presskit2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ax-2’s mission commander Peggy Whitson (left) and pilot John Shoffner (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WdTNfO"&gt;When Whitson retired from NASA in 2018, she didn’t think she’d go back to space again. “I didn’t think it was likely. Probably because of that, I was more excited to be assigned as an Axiom backup for Ax-1 and then prime commander for Ax-2 than even for my first spaceflight,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a phone interview. “It seemed even more unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTDeiJ"&gt;Shoffner, 65, is a trained pilot, investor in the life sciences industry, and a racecar driver who started a GT3 motorsports racing team named J2-Racing with his wife. He and Whitson will do research on the ISS for 10x Genomics, a California-based biotechnology company that manufactures gene sequencing technology for researchers. Shoffner, an investor 10x Genomics, plans to test single-cell sequencing methods while in microgravity, a first for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g10pUT"&gt;“I’m going to try and help because I’m a geek. I like this stuff, too,” says Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry from Rice University and was once the deputy division chief for the Medical Sciences Division at Johnson Space Center, NASA’s astronaut headquarters in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NhuHb8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ax-2 is planned for mid-2022 — if it can find a parking spot on the ISS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYiu1"&gt;Axiom says its private missions will launch every six months, meaning Ax-2 would launch in the middle of 2022 (or roughly half a year after Ax-1 in January 2022). But the date for Ax-2 depends largely on traffic at the space station, which only has two international docking adapters that serve as parking spaces for both cargo and government astronaut missions. Axiom will have to squeeze into the station’s increasingly busy schedule and reserve one of those adapters for the 10-day trip, including eight days docked to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9d6uz"&gt;Earlier this month, NASA signed an agreement with Axiom to greenlight the company’s Ax-1 mission. The Ax-1 crew is still going through a rigorous training process intended to adjust crew members to the G forces of launching to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwjYNq"&gt;While its crew members will have to go through the same training, the Ax-2 mission is likely to be more costly than Ax-1. NASA has shifted the prices for hosting private astronaut missions on the space station, primarily a government-run research platform. Axiom’s second mission will be subject to the agency’s latest pricing table: a base of $5.2 million per person, and $4.8 million per mission to pay for planning and integration. The day rate for each passenger is anywhere between $88,000 and $164,000 to accommodate food, cargo, and other services. Axiom says it sorts this out with NASA and includes all of these charges in the customer’s single ticket price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdZ3Hv"&gt;Axiom, founded in 2016 by a veteran NASA ISS program manager, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Axiom_Space/status/1380214866451959808?s=20"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its own private space station modules that it plans to attach to the ISS as soon as 2024. Whitson says her mission will help open doors for more ambitious crewed missions into space. “The future of spaceflight depends on us building an infrastructure that enables us to step further and further away from Earth,” she says. “This step by Axiom, introducing private astronauts to the space station, is going to be just the initial step.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams opens up to new collaborative apps that plug into meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hORw3weG-WehRmrNNpE5cJZCdA=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339256/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hOZai4"&gt;Microsoft first let developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332414/microsoft-teams-third-party-apps-calls-meetings-integration-features"&gt;build third-party apps into Teams last year&lt;/a&gt;, but the company is going a step further at Build 2021 today. In a push to get more app developers building for Teams, Microsoft is opening up its crucial APIs, Teams Store, and tools to what it calls collaborative apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYFUO"&gt;Developers will soon be able to build apps that plug into the Teams meeting canvas, ones that use in-app purchases or subscriptions, and even create separate apps that get access to Teams’ real-time video and audio streams. “If you can build web apps, you can build extensions into Teams chats, channels, and meetings,” explains Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can build once, run, deploy anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnNjuX"&gt;This means apps built for Teams will work across Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, Android, and even Linux. While we’ve seen some apps that plug into the meeting canvas previously, Microsoft is launching a preview that will allow devs to share apps like whiteboards and project boards and share apps more directly into the meetings area in Teams. Microsoft is also making it easier for devs to create these apps with greater integration into Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flAA2klkfbmktfE7VFXHh6lSCvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537996/teamstogethermode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custom Together Mode scenes are on the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GiQ71L"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode for Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which uses AI to segment your face and shoulders and place you and your co-workers together in a virtual space, is also being opened up. “We’re giving people a toolkit so they can design their own Together Modes scenes,” says Teper. “We’re pretty excited to see what people come up with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40KHr8"&gt;Later this summer, Microsoft will also allow third-party apps to access real-time audio and video streams from Teams. This will primarily allow for transcription or note-taking apps to process audio and video coming out of Teams, but it will also enable devs to create bespoke apps that access Teams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiOFj2mT8qKCJhMTYiVeGAQVLfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537998/teamstranscription.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-time access to Teams for transcription, note-taking, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sSvHq8"&gt;“Somebody could build a completely custom application that is different than the Teams UI and that app can interoperate with Teams via voice, video, or chat,” explains Teper. An example could be a hospital that wants to build a connection from their telehealth app into Teams to enable video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2lCu4"&gt;Microsoft will also allow developers to sell their own subscriptions within their Teams apps. This opens up the Teams Store to in-app purchases. Microsoft hasn’t gone into detail on whether it takes a cut on sales here, but Teper is keen to point out Microsoft’s main focus is building an ecosystem of apps. “We may make some money in the marketplace, but our primary business model will be the Microsoft 365 licenses and the Azure and Power platform licenses that developers consume,” says Teper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVhb98"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;145 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;, there certainly could be an appetite for more apps that plug into and appear inside of Teams meetings. Microsoft has always positioned Teams as a hub for productivity, and these latest announcements are clearly designed to make Teams a little more developer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hot summer days are even hotter for many Americans of color </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dangerous Heat Wave Grips Two-Thirds Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EleFbEd24dkZmH2rg7qPK2LlJVE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339260/1163059092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - JULY 19: Swimmers cool off at 31st Street Beach as temperatures climb into the 90’s with a heat index expected to reach as high as 115 degrees on July 19, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0BNc2Q"&gt;In cities across the US, people of color are enduring hotter summer temperatures than their white counterparts, new research shows. It’s another sign that the consequences of rising temperatures will hit vulnerable communities harder than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXpmUv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rising temperatures will hit vulnerable communities harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVYsG9"&gt;A person of color, on average, lives in a census tract that’s more than a full degree Celsius (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter in the summer than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22799-5"&gt;study published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That included anyone who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; identify as “white alone,” plus anyone who identifies as Hispanic. The difference in temperature was slightly larger still for Black residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eASvML"&gt;Cities are typically &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands"&gt;several degrees warmer&lt;/a&gt; than more rural areas, and areas within cities without much green space are even hotter. Asphalt, cement, and dark rooftops absorb heat, while exhaust from tail pipes and industry warm neighborhoods up even more. It’s a phenomenon called the “urban heat island effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AslJUU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extreme heat is already the deadliest weather-related disaster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8KfQ6"&gt;Extreme heat is already the &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;deadliest&lt;/a&gt; weather-related disaster in the US. The urban heat island effect and climate change are making blistering temperatures even riskier for people who live in cities. The risks are even greater for some groups, like &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/another-legacy-of-redlining-unequal-exposure-to-heat-waves/"&gt;Black Americans, who have faced a long history of housing discrimination and disinvestment&lt;/a&gt;. A rise in even a few degrees poses serious threats, the study’s lead author warns. The average one-degree Celsius difference in temperatures that people of color experience in America masks more extreme disparities — perhaps up to 10 degrees Celsius — that some communities face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhzuad"&gt;“That’s a lot when you translate that into real impacts and how that feels on a summertime day,” says Angel Hsu, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of public policy and the environment, ecology, and energy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFxMuA"&gt;Some neighborhoods in Hsu’s hometown of Greenville, South Carolina can see temperatures six to eight degrees Celsius higher than other parts of the city. They tended to be neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black residents. Other communities in Baltimore, Maryland got eight to ten degrees Celsius hotter than their neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU5D74"&gt;The research also showed that households below the poverty line, across all racial and ethnic groups, faced more blistering temperatures than more affluent households. But the average person of color still faced hotter temperatures than their white counterparts, regardless of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsgnmE"&gt;That’s evidence that something fishy is going on with regard to race in particular, Hsu says. Other studies have suggested the same thing — Black, Asian, and Latino people are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701995/"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to live in urban heat islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dmn4KA"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A long, terrible history of segregation in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbYq7x"&gt;There’s also a long, terrible history of segregation in the US that has pushed Black Americans and other marginalized groups into specific neighborhoods. Since the 1930s, financial institutions systemically denied home loans and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; to Black Americans. The result was &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/extreme-heat-redlining-portland/"&gt;“redlined”&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods, where &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html"&gt;the majority of residents were Black&lt;/a&gt;. City planners slotted more roadways and big building complexes in and around redlined neighborhoods — and all that asphalt and concrete turned them into heat traps. Black Americans are also &lt;a href="https://naacp.org/resources/fumes-across-fence-line-health-impacts-air-pollution-oil-gas-facilities-african-american"&gt;more likely to live near polluting industries&lt;/a&gt;, which can also make neighborhoods hotter. Now, these neighborhoods are up to 7 degrees Celsius hotter than other neighborhoods, according to another &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhyliD"&gt;All those disparities take a deadly toll. In New York City &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/datatable47.pdf"&gt;between 2000 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;, African Americans made up about a quarter of the city’s population, but nearly half of its heat-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juEqmE"&gt;The new study published today gives one of the most comprehensive views yet of how widespread the injustice still is. The researchers compared 2017 census data to high-resolution satellite-based temperature data for 497 urban areas in the US. They used satellite remote sensing to take stock of how surface temperatures differed between urban landscapes and more rural areas. They used that data to figure out how surfaces like asphalt made a location hotter compared to a more rural baseline. In the end, they discovered that in 169 of the 175 largest urban areas in the continental US, the average person of color lives with hotter summer daytime surface temperatures than a non-Hispanic white person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gahkqG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something that was really surprising is how systemic this problem is.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gERz39"&gt;“Something that was really surprising is how systemic this problem is. We’re not talking about one or two cities or a couple of major cities like Chicago or San Francisco. We’re talking about [this trend] in every single city,” Hsu says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjuAWW"&gt;The next step, she says, is to look at a time series to figure out whether the temperature gaps between Americans of different races have gotten any better or worse over the years. She hopes that this work can identify what’s still causing these disparities and inform solutions to cool these neighborhoods down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umGEL1"&gt;Looking forward, average temperatures are rising around the world because of climate change. But some places might feel the heat even more if they keep losing trees and green spaces to industrial development and urban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cult classic Shin Megami Tensei III gets remastered after modern consoles ‘left the game behind’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qH2xvs4v6l4PKaD9g78nprmPoqM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338919/ss_a4d30220223c122c15c5c5fefcbd8e250ab79ba2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8V12nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; has a lot in common with the rest of the cult roleplaying series — namely a focus on everything demonic and post-apocalyptic. And despite a punishing difficulty level, the game received rave reviews when it debuted on the PS2. But since then it has remained largely inaccessible. There’s no easy way to play &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; on modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYMl00"&gt;That changes today with the release of a new remastered version that’s available on the Switch, Steam, and PS4. For director Kazuyuki Yamai, it marks yet another chance to bring the game to new players. While &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; was initially a Japan-only release, Yamai worked on a special edition dubbed “Maniax” that would eventually launch in North America and Europe, as well as a larger director’s cut, called “Chronicle Edition,” that debuted in Japan in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dClYOM"&gt;I recently had the chance to share a few questions with Yamai over email. “Something stuck out to me was the fact that despite &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s acclaim over the years, modern consoles have all but left the game behind,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Read on for more about the original intentions behind the game, the initial backlash from fans, the influence of the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series, and why now is a good time for a remaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxEL7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG3vS4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you tell me about the goals the team had on the original version? What did you want to do that was new or different for the series, and do you think the audience understood at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1a2p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; was originally designed around the goal of fully rendering the world of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; in 3D — and in a striking way that would set it apart from its predecessors. However, these lofty demands caused the initial development team to run into all sorts of issues and eventually disband, so our team inherited the project in something of a critical state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9TnU0g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Nocturne’ actually faced a great deal of backlash from hardcore fans.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ulnl7s"&gt;Nonetheless, we made efforts to refine the core mechanics — things like the “press turn” battle system, recruiting, and leveling up demons — and sought to streamline the gameplay by removing complicated holdovers from previous titles, such as weapons and armor. So it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say we were responsible for overhauling the &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; series as a whole. A lot of these changes can be attributed to director Katsura Hashino, who later went on to turn &lt;em&gt;Persona 3&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; into wildly successful enterprises. He’s someone I’ve learned many invaluable lessons from over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRcBJh"&gt;At the time of its initial release, &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; actually faced a great deal of backlash from hardcore fans. Online forums were cluttered with negative statements like, “This isn’t &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; at all” or “This has lowered my expectations,” and I remember being heartbroken upon reading them. But as time passed, perceptions gradually began to shift, and by the time &lt;em&gt;Nocturne Maniax&lt;/em&gt; was released a year later, people had even started referring to the game as a masterpiece. This is the only time in my entire career that such an unexpected turnaround has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wusIZQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFs4m8oMiQg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KoXTuA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like going back to the game now so many years later? Were there elements that stuck out to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSmocu"&gt;This marks my fourth time developing &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; in all its various iterations, as I had previously worked on the original, &lt;em&gt;Maniax&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Chronicle Edition&lt;/em&gt;. So I couldn’t help but say to myself, “Wow, I guess I’m back at it again!” At this point, I’d like to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records for “Developing &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei III&lt;/em&gt; the Most Times.” But our fans have waited long enough for a remaster, so I was thrilled to hear this project was approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nUjK1r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wow, I guess I’m back at it again!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pw4YzS"&gt;Something stuck out to me was the fact that despite &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s acclaim over the years, modern consoles have all but left the game behind. Our team is very aware that many younger players, particularly &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; fans, are often drawn to &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; but can’t access the game due to the gap in hardware. So with the remaster, we sought to deliver a fresh experience for new players that didn’t betray the first impressions of the original fans. In short, we aimed to recreate the feeling of experiencing &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; for the first time but with vibrant, enhanced visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLfLry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were some of the main areas you wanted to focus on for the remaster? Did you have any big regrets — things you couldn’t do because of time or technological reasons — that you wanted to fix this time around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKWPyG"&gt;To summarize what was said above, our main focus was to recreate &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; as authentically as possible. At the same time, certain aspects of the game did feel outdated, and portions of the dialogue had either aged poorly or lacked nuance, so we took great care to update these in a way that didn’t feel intrusive or artificial. There was also some ambiguity regarding the usage of old voice assets, so we ended up hiring new talent to reenact the demon voices, often doing many retakes in the process. After recording finished, our sound staff adjusted the effects with painstaking attention to detail, and we feel that the new voices are nearly indistinguishable from the originals, even to the most attentive fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ozqM6n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Several times, the complexities of this endeavor pushed me to the breaking point.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1HpqQ"&gt;Upon reflecting on what we could or couldn’t implement with the original, there isn’t much that comes to mind. A large reason for that is because so much of the visuals and mechanics had already been perfected, and in my humble opinion, they still stand the test of time. But to remaster the game properly, a lot of polishing was needed, at least on the technical side (most of which centered around adding depth of field and eliminating obsolete graphical techniques, such as mipmaps). Because PS2 game architecture relied on vastly different elements than modern games (things like opacity and particle systems), we ended up spending a significant amount of time simply figuring out how to recreate old assets with the new technology at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLlV2A"&gt;Several times, the complexities of this endeavor pushed me to the breaking point, making me think, “We’ll never be able to do this from scratch!” But then miraculous things would happen, such as &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s original programmer coming in to write a shader that rendered graphics just like how they were in the old game. Efforts like these were what enabled the team to push past their challenges and move the project to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vz_s_nsKT8EA2IO0u6Xuh7np0Nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536333/ss_4db2c68fe18068ece110d91d63d203826e39ee79.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M3k2BE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The series has become much less niche in the intervening years, especially with the success of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Did that influence your approach with the remaster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kf12s"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series was certainly a big factor in helping expand our market and allowing this remaster to come to fruition. It’s amazing how faithfully the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series has stuck to its roots without drastically altering its image in a way that would betray fans’ expectations. I can proudly say that &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; has evolved into a franchise that has brought a diverse range of players into the &lt;em&gt;Megaten&lt;/em&gt; fold. But for those who are unfamiliar with &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps because they grew up in a generation without it, please note that the remaster was designed to provide the same unadulterated thrills as the original when it first came out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flexibits’ contact app Cardhop gets fresh revamp, added to Fantastical subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KBwBLItdssAbe70WYumqc-wRgE=/332x0:2495x1442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338916/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntEZaa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop"&gt;Flexibits&lt;/a&gt; — best known for its popular calendar application, Fantastical — has a new, overhauled version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16488490/cardhop-contacts-app-announced-fantastical-flexibits"&gt;contact management application Cardhop&lt;/a&gt; out today, which updates the app with new features and a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okjI9n"&gt;But most importantly, like Fantastical before it, Cardhop is also switching to a subscription model. The contact app is being added for free to the existing Fantastical Premium subscription that Flexibits introduced last year. And to mark that expanded scope, Fantastical Premium is also getting a new name: Flexibits Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rAnGkz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS and Mac calendar app Fantastical is moving to a subscription model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DCOHPu"&gt;The original Mac and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18280578/cardhop-app-contact-management-ios"&gt;iOS versions&lt;/a&gt; of Cardhop previously cost $19.99 and $4.99, respectively. However, similar to Fantastical, Flexibits will now be offering a more limited, free version of both of those applications to anyone, with more advanced functionality (including many of the new features being introduced with the new version of the app) locked to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfNZuv_zi4IjQXJbNHchfh2ibdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536968/cardhop.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0l8s"&gt;Flexibits, crucially, isn’t changing the price of its subscription program to go with the newly added app. Flexibits Premium will still cost $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year for an individual user, or $7.99 per month or $64.99 per year for up to five family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Z4FH"&gt;Existing Cardhop owners will still be able to access any features that were already present in their existing apps from before the switch to the subscription model without having to pay (also similar to the Fantastical switch). They just won’t get any major &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNwhgPAJDRHlzRw1gHLZ9GMK9Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536973/Relationships_Family_Tree.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqKU3I"&gt;Cardhop 2.0 does add a variety of new features, though. There’s a new Relationships mode, which can generate family trees for contacts that you’ve set relationships between or — if you have Google or Office 365 accounts linked — org charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDkunN"&gt;The iOS version of Cardhop has a new business card scanning feature, which does exactly what it says on the can, and there are new widgets for both macOS and iOS that can be customized to add quick links to call, text, or interact with a contact using any of Cardhop’s actions. (Want a link to quickly FaceTime a friend? Now you can.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idww5freXqEprE-bD1SNNdphMoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536965/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDYFJq"&gt;And given that Cardhop and Fantastical are now bundled together, there are also some deeper ties with the Flexibits calendar app. A new “Invite with Fantastical” action makes it easy to invite contacts (or whole groups of contacts) to events. Scanning a business card also gives an option to quickly follow up with an instant calendar meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrT2Ek"&gt;The new version of Cardhop is available to download now for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i9kBE3"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) is calling on the Treasury Department to fund broadband projects in communities without access to 100Mbps upload and download speeds with the money allocated by the American Rescue Plan earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eC0bMR"&gt;In March, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, directing the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars to help state and local governments amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As part of the plan, this funding can be used to expand access to high-speed broadband internet in communities that need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxeR8"&gt;However, the plan’s language suggests funding can only go to “unserved” or “underserved” communities. The Federal Communications Commission classifies communities with speeds of below 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up as “underserved.” In a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Tuesday, Wyden is asking that the department expand that definition to communities with speeds less than 100Mbps up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jhMomc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to telework and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sXXgQP"&gt;“The mass adoption of video calling, streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive apps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserly speeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and telehealth capacity,” Wyden wrote in the letter. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to telework and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mLu4E"&gt;The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fG1bAI"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained at the same level since 2015. But that definition has been called into question by lawmakers seeking to boost that standard as a result of heightened home internet usage due to the coronavirus pandemic. As infrastructure funding talks began earlier this year, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312065/fcc-highspeed-broadband-service-ajit-pai-bennet-angus-king-rob-portman"&gt;penned a letter to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; requesting that the agency change the definition of “high-speed” broadband to anything about 100Mbps symmetrical speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM8ebH"&gt;It’s unclear if Biden’s latest American Jobs Plan or any subsequent broadband funding measures from Congress could change this definition in the future. The Biden administration’s broadband plan originally called for $100 billion to connect every American to high-speed internet by the end of the decade. Republicans pushed back against that number, resulting in the administration scaling back its proposal &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/biden-cuts-35b-from-broadband-plan-amid-gop-opposition-deal-still-unlikely/"&gt;to $65 billion last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZLfid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXVPvL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok changes text-to-speech voice after voice actor sues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDtKf4S9giI1A-L8FtJYp-tjQZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338857/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ACavHo"&gt;TikTok has changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature, just weeks after an actor claiming to be the original voice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming she never agreed to be featured in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihmV2b"&gt;The new voice has been showing up in TikToks over the past day — often in videos of people commenting on the change. It sounds a bit more energetic and upbeat, creating a very different vibe than the droll monotone of the prior voice. The feature allows TikTok users to type out text and then have it read aloud over their videos, and it’s often used as a narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="gXYLPm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@wannabe.fairy/video/6965840145295625478" data-video-id="6965840145295625478" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@wannabe.fairy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wannabe.fairy"&gt;@wannabe.fairy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;PLEASE TIKTOK WHAT IS THIS &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="texttospeech" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texttospeech"&gt;#texttospeech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Castaways - The Backyardigans" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Castaways-655741"&gt;♬ Castaways - The Backyardigans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3UC2mn"&gt;This new voice appears to be a response to a lawsuit filed against TikTok owner ByteDance earlier this month. Voice actor Bev Standing claimed that she was the voice behind TikTok’s text-to-speech feature and that she had never agreed to work with the company. Standing said she had done voice recordings meant to be used for translations, but that she hadn’t authorized use of her voice beyond that specific instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHGaFU"&gt;The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. Videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXuxcK"&gt;TikTok has yet to comment on Standing’s lawsuit or the new voice. But this week’s change suggests the company is taking her lawsuit seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna says its COVID-19 vaccine is effective in teens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A nurse holds a vial containing Moderna vaccine. The La..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bxSXHyN5Yfa8CzNvJWT8kwKXm5Y=/0x2:5000x3335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338631/1232890663.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A vial of the Mo | Photo by Ramon Costa/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8R8IO"&gt;Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is effective in 12- to 17-year-olds, the company announced today &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-teencove-study-its-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. It plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the shot for this age group in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jHEDV"&gt;None of the teens who received two shots of the Moderna vaccine in a clinical trial developed COVID-19, and there were no safety concerns. The trial included 3,732 participants. Two-thirds got the shot, and one-third received placebo injections. There were four cases of COVID-19 in the group that received placebo injections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsldUV"&gt;The vaccine was 93 percent effective against even mild forms of the disease in this group as early as 14 days after the first dose, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3sE2C"&gt;The Moderna vaccine is currently authorized for people 18 and older. If the FDA allows its use for people as young as 12, it would be the second COVID-19 vaccine available to people under the age of 18. The Pfizer / BioNTech shot was originally authorized for people 16 years and older, and the FDA signed off on its use in kids ages 12 to 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmaBGS"&gt;Children and teenagers rarely get seriously sick or die from COVID-19, but it does happen in some cases. They can also spread the virus to others if they contract the infection. Having another vaccine available for school-aged teens and adolescents would boost efforts to get them immunized ahead of anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-schools-will-be-fully-in-person-in-fall-no-remote-learning-11621870843"&gt;in-person schoo&lt;/a&gt;l in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYsj8z"&gt;“The more vaccines we have to protect adolescents from COVID-19, the better,” Kristin Oliver, a pediatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/25/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpn6uT"&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;5 million&lt;/a&gt; people under the age of 18 in the United States have had at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abj17I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many of the best Nintendo Switch games are $40 at GameStop right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lMbCXypG5xwutVAsEhyrAJiKuBo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338615/NintendoSwitch_TLOZBreathoftheWild_Presentation2017_scrn15_png_jpgcopy.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;is one of many first-party Nintendo games on sale right now at GameStop.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPYTfb"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably already familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It remains one of the most ambitious and charming &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; titles to date. But like most first-party Nintendo games, it’s one that rarely receives a sizeable discount. Right now, though, you can purchase a physical edition of the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergeNintendoGames052521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild%2F10141904.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;beloved title at GameStop for $40&lt;/a&gt;, with free shipping. The popular retailer is also offering a host of other first- and third-party games at a discount as part of its ongoing Memorial Day sale, including standouts such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303746/persona-5-strikers-review-ps4-pc-nintendo-switch-atlus-omega-force"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona V Strikers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergeNintendoGames052521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fsplatoon-2%2F10141907.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergeNintendoGames052521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze%2F10157965.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if only &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate &lt;/em&gt;would&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E4BBsW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10516697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="497Yu5"&gt;If you’re more of an Xbox gamer looking for something to let you play games while on the go, Microsoft just updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450941/microsoft-surface-duo-xbox-mobile-xcloud-cloud-gaming-dual-screen"&gt;Cloud Gaming app on the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; to let you use one of the screens as a virtual controller. Conveniently, Amazon has both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Duo-128GB-Glacier/dp/B094PPCP8V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Duo-256GB-Glacier/dp/B08M9BW43V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; versions of the Surface Duo on sale for $619 and $656, respectively, once you clip the 25 percent coupon. These models are locked to AT&amp;amp;T, however, so you’ll need to have an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and service to use them when outside of a Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8lVkr0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10517551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nrGGAE"&gt;If gaming isn’t your thing, but you’re still in the market for a professional monitor, the Dell 27-inch U2719DX is worth consideration. Currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741552650497228699" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $250&lt;/a&gt; — an all-time low — the QHD 1440p peripheral offers color-accurate visuals and a thin profile, one that looks as sturdy as it is ergonomic. It tops out at 60Hz and lacks the USB-C connectivity found on pricier displays such as the like-minded &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Ultrasharp-U2719DC-Performance-Compatible/dp/B07JQTNCGB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U2719DC&lt;/a&gt;. But given it’s currently more than $100 off, the lack of futureproofing is a bit more understandable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3NasZB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10516817"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuxImk"&gt;If you have no intention of making the jump to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro with the M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, picking up a keyboard is a great way to make the most of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Amazon is offering the biggest discount we’ve seen in recent months on Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio Case for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The protective fabric-lined case magnetically attaches to the back of either the 2018 or 2020 iPad Pro, provides two viewing angles, and is a joy to type on, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we still wouldn’t recommend it&lt;/a&gt; as your primary writing device. For a limited time, you can pick it up for more than &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSWPY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off the initial list price at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jX58oc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="jQZenO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FlsIHu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
