    <title>BMW’s Joytopia metaverse has Christoph Waltz and Coldplay wait come back </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PpHXbJpQj_OTO8QgvI0p-tu-_r0=/102x0:1593x994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810193/Screen_Shot_2021_09_02_at_2.16.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eS4740"&gt;I want to preface this post by saying I will never pretend to understand why corporations do some of the things they do. I was simply minding my own business, looking for information on BMW’s new &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341092EN/bmw-motorrad-concept-ce-02"&gt;concept scooter&lt;/a&gt; on the German automaker’s press site, when... well, here, look: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w68d0g"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341635EN/bmw-launches-new-streaming-platform-joytopia-narrated-by-academy-award-winning-actor-christoph-waltz-for-the-iaa-mobility-exclusive-concert-by-british-band-coldplay-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-a-new-virtual-world"&gt;BMW launches new streaming platform JOYTOPIA narrated by Academy Award winning actor Christoph Waltz for the IAA Mobility. Exclusive concert by British band Coldplay pulls back the curtain on a new virtual world&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rxWBz6"&gt;And right underneath that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SbSv2Q"&gt;+++ BMW elevates brand communications to a new level +++ Exclusive concert by Coldplay celebrates the launch of the new JOYTOPIA virtual world +++ New brand channel will remain an integral element of corporate and brand communications beyond the IAA Mobility +++ With JOYTOPIA BMW has created its own metaverse +++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OEgWie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biiiig exhale&lt;/em&gt;. Okay, a few things. First, what in the ever-loving hell? Second, IAA Mobility is the shorthand name for the International Motor Show that kicks off this weekend in Germany. Expect more... regular news from there. Third... a “streaming platform” but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a “metaverse”? Last but not least: “Joytopia,” eh? And in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitopia"&gt;that font&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhF1QL"&gt;Listen, I’m sorry, but there’s just no way through this without making you read some excerpts of this press release with me. Down the rabbit hole we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EK4geW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munich.&lt;/strong&gt; Two days before the opening of the IAA Mobility international motor show taking place in Munich on 7 – 12 September 2021, BMW is unveiling its own, globally unique virtual world: JOYTOPIA. The highlight of the presentation on 5 September will be an exclusive performance by Coldplay. The British band will play a virtual concert on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MCcY3"&gt;JOYTOPIA will provide users with an unprecedented concert experience. As well as being live at the Coldplay performance, fans can also get actively involved in the event via avatars. They will be able to dance along with the music through their invented character, get close to the stage and see the band in action from every angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EilU0l"&gt;Okay, fine! Honestly, as far as big-ticket promotional brand exercises go, this isn’t so deeply outrageous. It’s like, one step removed from BMW doing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-gameshttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-games"&gt;a concert in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9pYNkx"&gt;The concert will feature a set list of four Coldplay songs, including their hit “Higher Power” produced exclusively for the BMW Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O3iySY"&gt;Oh... okay. They paid Coldplay to make a song? That’s already a “hit”? Seems kind of wild. Check this out, it was even used &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/06/11/video-bmw-ix-and-i4-commercial-features-coldplays-new-hit-higher-power/"&gt;in commercials&lt;/a&gt; for some of BMW’s upcoming electric vehicles. In fact, in a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/middle-east/article/detail/T0335742EN/the-first-ever-bmw-ix-and-the-first-ever-bmw-i4:-joint-global-campaign-plays-to-the-rhythm-of-coldplay-s-new-hit?language=en"&gt;June press release&lt;/a&gt;, BMW said the song marks the beginning of a “long-term cooperation between BMW and the Warner Music mega-band with sustainability as the unifying element...” — actually, wait, sorry, I can’t jump into another absurd press release or we’ll be here all week. Back to Joytopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tbRshq"&gt;On 5 September the concert can be enjoyed around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JUeYRk"&gt;Is... is that a threat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="z47RBr"&gt;“With JOYTOPIA we have created our own metaverse. This sees us responding to the demand from our customers for individualised experiences in the digital space,” says Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and Brand Experience. “We want to open up a new dialogue with audiences that shifts the status quo from brand interpretation to user interpretation. JOYTOPIA is a quantum leap for the digital world. It enables us to take brand communications to a new level,” adds Ponikva. JOYTOPIA is a new marketing instrument for the digital world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IZbPB2"&gt;“Metaverse,” if you’re not terminally online, is the hot new buzzword du jour, in part because of... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;? Again, I &lt;em&gt;do not pretend to understand why corporations do these things&lt;/em&gt; or why they feel the need to claim that Coldplay doing a virtual concert inside a modern version of Habbo Hotel or whatever is “a quantum leap for the digital world.” I &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know that it only gets weirder from here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6mZ1UF"&gt;JOYTOPIA guests are welcomed to the platform – which boasts impressive visual quality – by a virtual fox and are guided through the surreal worlds. The voice of the fox is that of Hollywood actor Christoph Waltz. “The future is what happens next and it’s entirely up to us to make it enjoyable. This was my first encounter with a metaverse. It’s not called JOYTOPIA for nothing. The joy of… “ says the Academy Award Winner and alludes to the diversity of the virtual world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AOxTvG"&gt;I beg you to take some time with each of those sentences. Really soak them up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atoi1E"&gt;The first sentence abruptly introduces the idea that visitors to the Joytopia metaverse will be guided by a virtual fox, but only after BMW apparently feels the need to assure potential visitors that it won’t look like crap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRVXgJ"&gt;And then, hey, yeah, Christoph Waltz! Why not? (I mean, maybe there’s a reason if you consider one of his most famous roles &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/03/07/bmw-admits-regret-over-using-nazi-slave-labor-during-wwii/"&gt;alongside certain parts of the company’s history&lt;/a&gt;...) What does Christoph have to say about playing a virtual fox? Ah, it will be his experience with a metaverse? Samesies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="napxNp"&gt;What’s that, Christoph? You okay? You just... sort of trailed off there? Hey guys, did we really not get Christoph to finish his thought? Is he being paid by the word or something? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onatc1"&gt;Wait, Christoph — are you okay? Blink your fox eyes twice if you’re trapped in the BMW metaverse with Coldplay. Do we have to come save you? Is &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;what this is all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tITxIx"&gt;There’s no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going. There’s no knowing where we’re rowing, or which way the river’s flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing? Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing. Are the fires of hell a-glowing? Is the grizzly reaper mowing? Yes! The danger must be growing so the rowers keep on rowing, and they’re certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lSi5gt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB401RfGMlM"&gt;Just making sure you’re still with me&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, Christoph Waltz would make a good Willy Wonka now that I think about it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fzwijV"&gt;JOYTOPIA users will have fun navigating their way independently through three unique worlds as an avatar, using a map and signposts for help. The avatars can run, hop or fly, and users can choose their form and colour. Similarly to other gaming consoles, JOYTOPIA allows users to interact with other avatars and wave at them, for example. At public events, users can also create their own spaces. Selfies are possible, too, and can be posted directly to social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzuqKy"&gt;Something about the way “Selfies are possible, too” is thrown in there really bums me out, but I haven’t been able to crack why. But yeah, sure, again, kinda just sounds a lot like a concert in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;when you strip away all the gauzy language, doesn’t it? I get that BMW apparently paid some firm to create this bespoke metaverse, but we can’t really say how different Joytopia will be until the site... sorry, &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;... or was it streaming platform?... launches. Until then, goodness gracious, look at what’s there now: &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ogO1X"&gt;Indeed. Why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;we here? I guess we’ll find out when Coldplay takes the stage. See you in Joytopia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reports having 50 million Premium and Music subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzaIAY8Oia1QHvQViLMkC9FptGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810147/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GmTOIg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has 50 million users subscribed to or trying YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, which is a marked increase from the 30 million &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/google-earnings-antitrust-scrutiny/"&gt;subscribers it reported in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to mark a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;continued trend&lt;/a&gt; in people looking to make the jump from the free versions of YouTube and YouTube Music, even as more services are competing in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKGlus"&gt;Google doesn’t break down that 50 million number any further, so we don’t really know how many people are subscribed to YouTube Music or Premium and how many are using the services’ free one-month trial. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;its blog post&lt;/a&gt; spends a lot of time talking about music, hailing YouTube as the fastest-growing music-subscription service. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/youtube-music-passes-50-million-subscribers-up-20-million-in-less-than-a-year-1235054559/"&gt;compared Google’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; with other streaming services. It reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596155/spotify-earnings-q2-2021-podcasting-investments-acquisitions-subscribers"&gt;Spotify has around 165 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae722400-561c-431a-85eb-e09e1f6b0bb2"&gt;quotes estimates&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music having 78 million. (The last official word was in June 2019 when Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;its service had passed 60 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYHZDp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t really break down what that 50 million number means&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pb5Iww"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium"&gt;YouTube Music Premium&lt;/a&gt; costs $9.99 a month and lets users listen to and download ad-free music. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; goes for $11.99 a month and gives subscribers access to all of the benefits of YouTube Music, with the ability to also download and watch regular videos ad-free. Premium subscribers can also have videos play in the background while they’re using another app or their phone is locked. For those who spend a lot of time watching non-music content on the platform, that’s a much better experience for not that much more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H9q35"&gt;Google hasn’t commented on what caused the 20 million-subscriber increase, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind that last year’s count was reported right around the time when Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354136/google-play-music-shut-down-end-service-youtube-music-date"&gt;shutting down its Play Music service&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to tell how many people were subscribed to it — but both Google Play and YouTube Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537261/google-youtube-music-play-music-15-million-subscribers"&gt;reportedly had 15 million subscribers combined&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BsHjOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s clear a growing number of people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lz9bKq"&gt;Without knowing the breakdown, it’s hard to tell exactly what this means for Google. Were more people interested in letting videos play in the background without ads, or were they looking for an alternative or addition to Spotify and Apple Music? Taking a step back, it’s clear more people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings. While there have been plenty of (admittedly justified) complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;glut of video&lt;/a&gt; and audio streaming services, it seems there’s still room to grow, if Google is any example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is now denying its CEO saved an exec from being fired for discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jndCQBTI1rx-Nb0ApToeCIldqx0=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805108/670451714.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jEBWV"&gt;It hasn’t even been two months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Amazon CEO Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; took the reins from founder Jeff Bezos, but the company’s new chief executive is already facing a potential scandal. Two anonymous sources have accused Jassy of stepping in to overrule the company’s own HR department when it recommended that an executive be fired for discrimination — and Amazon didn’t initially deny it, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/aws-jassy-bell-discrimination"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is now suggesting to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s not true, a day after we first published this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9mr06"&gt;The story goes that in 2019, a Black female Amazon employee accused AWS Outposts general manager Joshua Burgin of discrimination, and HR issued a report recommending he be fired. But Jassy fielded a personal request from Burgin’s boss, Charlie Bell, and decided to let him stay. (At the time, Jassy was CEO of AWS, Bell was a star cloud executive who also reportedly served as a member of Amazon’s senior leadership team, and Burgin was Bell’s chief of staff. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/microsoft-hires-charlie-bell-former-amazon-cloud-exec.html"&gt;Bell recently moved to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PZrIlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We [...] took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpR5wH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; writes that when it presented Amazon with “a detailed account of the events,” the company didn’t dispute it: “In this instance, we conducted a thorough investigation and took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWVbgc"&gt;Amazon initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it didn’t have anything to share beyond that non-denial statement, but on Thursday it came out with a partial denial after all: “The suggestion that Andy overruled a recommendation provided to him in this case is not correct,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.  “As with any disciplinary decision, as more data was presented and discussions continued, opinions on the appropriate course of action evolved. The final recommendation was the one ultimately pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoP7Xw"&gt;Amazon declined to provide a copy of that final recommendation for us to verify, and wouldn’t tell us whether Jassy might have been involved in crafting that final recommendation himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vlbgR"&gt;Amazon’s partial denial arrived a day after we originally published this story under the headline “Amazon isn’t denying its CEO saved an exec from being fired for discrimination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7B76J"&gt;In July, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590134/amazon-harassment-discrimination-allegations-investigation"&gt;pledged to investigate&lt;/a&gt; allegations of discrimination and harassment inside its AWS unit after 550 Amazon workers signed a petition accusing the company of fostering an “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias against women and under-represented groups.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;Five specific female Amazon employees also sued the company for discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in May, three of whom still worked for Amazon at the time. It’s not clear whether the worker who accused Burgin — and by association, Jassy — is one of those five, but &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; suggests she’s suing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Assr7C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywPS1d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 2nd, 3:44PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Amazon’s denial, a day after Amazon declined to deny the story to both &lt;/em&gt;Protocol&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8dm6v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West,&lt;/em&gt; the sequel to the much-beloved &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, is now available for preorder ahead of the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;newly announced February 18th, 2022, release date&lt;/a&gt; for both PS4 and PS5. But if you’re planning to play the game on PS4 and eventually try it on PS5, there’s no way to get a cross-gen upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TA04k"&gt;Instead, you’ll have to buy the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;more expensive versions of the game&lt;/a&gt; that offer digital copies for both the PS4 and PS5 or start with PS4 and buy an entirely new PS5 copy of the game later at its full price. And you shouldn’t expect some kind of upgrade to be introduced down the line, as Sony says it has &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/horizon-forbidden-west-support/"&gt;“no plans”&lt;/a&gt; for that kind of offer, even though you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; transfer your save data from the PS4 to PS5 versions of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWjiOv"&gt;To get both the PS4 and PS5 digital versions of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;in a single package, you have to buy the spendier &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;$79.99 Digital Deluxe Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-collectors-edition-ps4-ps5.3006185"&gt;$199.99 Collector’s Edition&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-regalla-edition-ps4-ps5.3006217"&gt;$259.99 Regalla Edition&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast, the Standard Edition will cost $59.99 on PS4 and $69.99 on PS5. There’s also a &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-special-edition-ps4.3006306?smcid=pdc:us-en:web-pdc-games-horizon-forbidden-west:buttonblock-pre-order-now"&gt;Special Edition for PS4 that costs $69.99&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a digital soundtrack, a “mini art book,” and comes in a steelcase box. (There’s a separate &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-special-edition-ps5.3006308"&gt;PS5 version of that edition, too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2yISzC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no option for a cross-gen upgrade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4I8Yx"&gt;Sony has shown a willingness to offer upgrade paths with some of its other titles. The company allows players to pay to upgrade from the PS4 to the PS5 version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and from the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; to the PS5-exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Sony has also released free patches optimizing PS4 games for PS5, like it did for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260829/god-of-war-2018-ps5-patch-free-update-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641595/horizon-zero-dawn-60fps-update-ps5-1-53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, there’s no option for a cross-gen upgrade at all. Sony’s asking you to pay at least $20 extra upfront to be able to eventually play the game on a system you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;may not even have yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZqV9D"&gt;And for fans of collecting physical copies of games, you should know that &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West’s&lt;/em&gt; Collector’s and Regalla Editions won’t come with game discs. Instead, they’ll have a download code that lets you play &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 or PS5. Those more expensive editions of the game do offer a lot of other bonuses, though, including impressive statues of a big elephant-like machine. You can read all about &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;what’s available in each edition on Sony’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqwDly"&gt;Sony showed off some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;impressive footage of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s possible we could see more of the game at the just-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653773/sony-playstation-showcase-date-ps5-future"&gt;PlayStation showcase for September 9th&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be rounded up the biggest announcements, so check back then.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM temporarily shuts down North American factories because of chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="General Motors Posts $2.8 Billion Profit In Second Quarter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ra4SKvCaxM4cJt0yNikPx3bK1r8=/0x175:6000x4175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809584/1332379627.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7ZiA6"&gt;General Motors, parent company of Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick, said it was temporarily halting production at six of its North American factories as a result of the global chip shortage. It’s the latest major automaker to be affected by the tight supply of essential computer chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bsm5F"&gt;Four of GM’s US-based plants will be affected: Fort Wayne, Indiana; Wentzville, Missouri; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Lansing, Michigan. Four other factories in Mexico and Canada will also go dark for several weeks as GM works to shore up its supply of chips. The halt in production will affect GM’s most profitable vehicles, including pickup trucks and SUVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AwW3QB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The situation remains complex and very fluid”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hcxDwx"&gt;“During the downtime, we will repair and ship unfinished vehicles from many impacted plants, including Fort Wayne and Silao, to dealers to help meet the strong customer demand for our products,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Although the situation remains complex and very fluid, we remain confident in our team’s ability to continue finding creative solutions to minimize the impact on our highest-demand and capacity-constrained vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfYdrH"&gt;Affected vehicles include the Chevy Silverado, Cheyenne, Traverse, Equinox, and Express; GMC Acadia, Sierra, Savana, Terrain, and Canyon; Buick Enclave; and Cadillac XT5 and XT6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6viMW"&gt;This is the second time GM has had to announce temporary factory shutdowns in response to the chip shortage. The automaker, which is the largest in North America, previously idled several factories for two weeks back in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4Ms3a"&gt;Of course, GM isn’t alone in feeling the pain from the global shortage of semiconductor chips, which is showing no signs of improvement. Practically every automaker has had to cut production and temporarily shut down factories in response, including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-sees-global-chip-shortage-worsening-in-second-half-11625861486"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22619190/ford-mustang-mach-e-chip-shortage-delay-6-weeks-250kwh"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632330/toyota-production-japan-north-america-chip-shortage-ford-tesla-gm-vw"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OASM3t"&gt;Even Tesla, which makes far fewer vehicles than most of its rivals, said that it had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite its vehicles’ software&lt;/a&gt; to support alternative chips. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an earnings call that “the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZ3rqm"&gt;During a recent earnings call, GM executives wouldn’t specify how much production they expect to lose to the chip shortage. But CEO Mary Barra said purchasing, manufacturing, engineering, and sales teams are working to divert the chips from cars and smaller SUVs to full-size pickup trucks, big SUVs, and new electric vehicles. The company stressed that the shortage would cost $1.5 billion to $2 billion in earnings before taxes this year due to lost production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will ask before it targets you with its ads in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMkgnshIHy6fTOFw2REVRR-NYYE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809320/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5vjBv"&gt;Apple will start asking for permission to enable Personalized Ads in iOS 15, the company’s method of serving relevant ads in the App Store and Apple News by analyzing what you read, purchase, and search for on your device (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company used to collect that information by default, but now it plans to ask for permission. Apple required other developers to seek users’ permission with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;the debut of App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems like it’s showing that it will hold itself to a similar standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf5qug"&gt;The Personalized Ads pop-up should show up when you open the App Store if you’re running the most recent iOS 15 beta. In the pop-up, Apple writes that the ads will help you discover relevant apps, products, and services while protecting your privacy by using “device-generated identifiers and not linking advertising information to your Apple ID.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XSUzobPS7GnLP3OmgCSJnTv6BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822881/IMG_0003.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image:  Mitchell Clark /&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Personalized Ads pop-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VznZjE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Apple’s Advertising policy&lt;/a&gt;, the sources it draws from to target ads vary, but they can include your device information (including your location if you’ve granted permission), App Store searches and purchases, and news stories you read in Apple News. The company links to its policy and also lets you turn off personalized ads entirely in the Settings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u07MXH"&gt;From one angle, this is one of the smallest gestures Apple could make toward treating itself the same way it treats developers — who all have to ask to track users of Apple’s products as part of the controversial App Tracking Transparency policy. As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; mentions, however, Apple’s closed-loop first-party ad targeting technically doesn’t fall under the purview of those restrictions, unlike developers’ apps that may share the information they collect with third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xo8PjH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple’s rule for other developers: you have to ask users if they want to be “tracked” for ad targeting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Apple’s own ad tracking is “personalization,” which sounds much less nefarious &lt;a href="https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb"&gt;https://t.co/hsAQuT8zYb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Heath (@alexeheath) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FYVTU"&gt;Apple’s language choice is worth examining, too, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1433460592619126785?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior reporter Alex Heath notes&lt;/a&gt;: developers are expected to ask a user if they consent to being tracked, while Apple is allowed to refer to what it’s doing as “personalization.” Those words don’t exactly have the same positive connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCOhaS"&gt;This change might be better viewed as yet another minuscule concession — like recent changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;to what developers are allowed to link to in-app&lt;/a&gt; — in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the current antitrust scrutiny Apple faces&lt;/a&gt; and will likely deal with in the future. A little ad-tracking pop-up is a small piece of evidence to point to and say, “See, we’re trying to be fair” whether or not they actually are being fair in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWhtqK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi’s Grandsphere concept car is another luxurious living room on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/27KGfDVsI_YEtlIKP15gf-Mj0EU=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809280/GrandSphere60875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jbLlZY"&gt;Automakers love concept cars that tease a future in which very rich people ride around in autonomous vehicles that look like luxurious living spaces. The latest is Audi’s Grandsphere, a spacious electric sedan with an interior that looks like it was designed by a Kardashian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hvrwhw"&gt;The car is designed to be adjustable based on the preferred driving style. If you want the car to drive itself, the steering wheel and pedals retract, leaving you sitting in a minimally designed living room setting with wood trim and wool textures. Instead of a screen, the car’s operating system is projected on the surface of the wood dashboard under the windshield. And when you’re ready to drive yourself, the manual controls simply appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTaooV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grandsphere is Audi’s second concept car in a series of three&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gihMs7"&gt;Grandsphere is Audi’s second concept car in a series of three that the German automaker said would “reinvent mobility as we know it today.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621735/audi-skysphere-concept-car-autonomous-electric-transformer"&gt;The first was the Skysphere&lt;/a&gt;, a sleek, villainous-looking electric convertible with an adjustable chassis. Audi is using the term “sphere,” which is a three-dimensional representation of a ring, to describe each of these concepts. Still, it’s weird we’re only getting three concepts and not four like Audi’s logo, but so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKi9wD30kFTZC7YdOnBvoK5vetk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822666/GrandSphere60453.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Audi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOHSLA"&gt;Audi says it is working with CARIAD, parent group Volkswagen’s software “think tank,” on developing some of the technologies it is showing off with the Grandsphere and other concepts. The automaker believes these features will be ready for consumer vehicles by the second half of the decade. (Best to take these statements with a grain of salt; automakers are very bad at predicting the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzsPEe"&gt;Audi sees Level 4 autonomy — in which a car can drive itself without human interventions under certain conditions — as a means to redefine the interior of the vehicle. And the automaker isn’t alone in this theory. Other car companies, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14166808/bmw-interior-concept-inside-future-sculpture-photos"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822398/volvos-360c-concept-autonomous-car-electric-future"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20828319/hyundai-45-electric-concept-car-design-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, have projected similar ideas onto their concepts, with interiors transformed into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/9/14190880/self-driving-car-third-place-rinspeed-oasis-ces-2017"&gt;“third places”&lt;/a&gt; in which we work, eat, sleep, and socialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2e5bn"&gt;This has long been the goal of those who believe that autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform society. Of course, autonomous vehicles have fallen short of expectations in recent years, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;many companies seeking off-ramps&lt;/a&gt; as the timeline extends out and costs pile up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9opWNZFplVJKBqc2wp4InSR7h3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822668/GrandSphere61235_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Audi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fl-bMSIh8yPkdTCMgKUU-O8oQ-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822671/GrandSphere60765.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Audi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QIEr3w"&gt;Audi describes its Grandsphere concept as a “first class lounge with maximum space.” The exterior is also meant to convey similar notes of luxury and refinement, but it also looks deadly — and not in a bad way. Its stretched-out shape looks nothing like most sedans, with a wheelbase that is even longer than the current Audi A8. The automaker said it was trying to meld a sedan with a “tightly-drawn four-door GT” with the exterior profile. The sloping arc of the roofline hints at Audi’s sportback tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0nG8s"&gt;Audi’s next concept will be the Urbansphere, which the automaker has described as a “private space in an urban environment.” But that vehicle won’t be revealed until 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIITTD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10731885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I7rGRr"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb_TLg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, giving an early look at Amazon’s upcoming adaptation of Robert Jordan’s epic 14-book fantasy series ahead of its November 19th release date on Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGkz8K"&gt;The trailer sets the stage for the series, establishing some of the basic tenets of Jordan’s world, with a specific focus on Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), a member of a group of female magic wielders known as the Aes Sedai, who are capable of wielding the One Power to accomplish feats like controlling the elements and healing others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvx1ir"&gt;The trailer also shows off a first look at &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s younger cast: Madeleine Madden as Egwene al’Vere, Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara, Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon, Zoë Robins as Nynaeve al’Meara, and Josha Stradowski as Rand al’Thor — the five central characters in Jordan’s books who Moiraine ends up mentoring as they journey to save the world from darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFEyAj"&gt;Fans will also recognize other key elements of Jordan’s story teased in the trailer, including a visit to Shadar Logoth, a cursed city of shadow; the White Tower of Tar Valon and a glimpse at the different color-coded orders of Aes Sedai; and the show’s take on the corrupted Myrddraal and Trollocs that will oppose Moiraine’s group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AN5ptB"&gt;It’s been a long road for &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series to become a TV show. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928400/amazon-video-robert-jordan-wheel-of-time-neil-gaiman"&gt;Amazon first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had greenlit a series in 2018, but production was delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9YS61"&gt;Amazon’s show isn’t technically the first time an attempt at a &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; show has been put to the screen: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8008387/wheel-of-time-pilot-fxx"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, FXX aired a half-hour episode of &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time: Winter Dragon, &lt;/em&gt;a pilot that had been secretly produced and aired in the dead of night as an attempt to prevent the adaptation rights for the series from reverting back to Jordan’s estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GkWxYE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A Wheel of Time pilot was produced and aired when no one was looking","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8008387/wheel-of-time-pilot-fxx"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WugcFs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of Amazon’s plans for a big-budget fantasy adaptation to try to succeed as the heir to &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;The company is also hard at work on a new &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; series that looks to be one of the most expensive TV shows ever made, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;which will debut on September 2nd, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter has plans to let users hide their old tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUSgHb96s9TjFkEel0WK2pjckKY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808819/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjbShG"&gt;Twitter is planning new features to give people more privacy options, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-to-get-more-people-tweeting"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The social network’s plans reportedly include the option to archive old tweets so they’re not visible to other users after a given period of time (like 30, 60, or 90 days or a full year). They also include possible options to limit who can see which tweets you’ve liked, to let people remove themselves from a conversation on Twitter, and to let people remove followers without outright blocking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RSkbr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;describes the new features as a suite of “social privacy” changes that are aimed at making people more comfortable engaging on Twitter. Internal research at Twitter apparently found that many users don’t even understand whether their accounts are set to public or private — something the company will begin asking users to review in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9e43Je"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes would replace workarounds like soft blocking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i66TYG"&gt;There’s no timeline for some of the changes, and the archive option, in particular, is in the “concept phase,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. But Twitter reportedly plans to start letting people remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year and to let people remove followers (as opposed to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-soft-block-on-twitter#:~:text=To%20soft%20block%20someone%2C%20you,t%20appear%20to%20be%20blocked."&gt;soft blocking&lt;/a&gt; them) starting this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yisL7a"&gt;Twitter confirmed the news in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “At Twitter, privacy is more than what we do with your data, it’s also about how we help you feel safe and in control of how you show up on Twitter,” a spokesperson said. “We understand that there’s no one size fits all approach to privacy, so we’re excited to roll out more features and tools to empower people on Twitter to customize their experience. Our focus on social privacy is inspired by feedback we received through a global research study we conducted to better understand people’s perceptions of and needs for privacy around the globe. We’ll begin testing some of these features as soon as next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOQ256"&gt;The upcoming changes accompany a flurry of other recent updates to Twitter. Over the past year, the company has tested monetization features like ticketed audio rooms, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; last week, and subscription-based “Super Follows,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4FRmr"&gt;As&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges, the privacy changes replicate sometimes clunky workarounds that many users have already adopted, including external services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete tweets&lt;/a&gt; after a certain period of time. That stands in contrast with Twitter’s Fleets — an expiring message tool that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter retired after eight months&lt;/a&gt; of low usage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Totally real actor who plays Roy Kent responds to conspiracy theory that he is CGI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D12nxpfJHk6eq5e9crJU7HCjJIQ=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803841/brett_goldstein_ted_lasso.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You want me to believe this is flesh and blood? Absolutely not, but they did a great job with the fabric effects. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPszDs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 2nd, 12:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “actor” Brett Goldstein has addressed the conspiracy theory that &lt;/em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;em&gt;’s Roy Kent is a CGI creation head-on by publishing a statement on Instagram. In it, Goldstein notes (quite accurately) that “there’s a fucking load of mad shit happening on the internet today, as usual” before reassuring viewers that he is “a completely real normal human man” who does “normal human basic things like rendering and buffering and transferring data.” Glad to have that sorted out. (The original story follows below.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mpDj55"&gt;I’ll confess this upfront: I’ve yet to watch an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso. &lt;/em&gt;But I absolutely buy the conspiracy theory that one of the show’s main characters, Roy Kent, is a CGI creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyzetq"&gt;People on Reddit have apparently been talking about this &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TedLasso/comments/j268hn/ok_just_started_the_show_and_cgi/"&gt;for months&lt;/a&gt;, but after their discussion was shared on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guymrdth/status/1431693140902219781"&gt;Twitter this week&lt;/a&gt;, the theory about the Apple TV Plus show has gone mainstream. I read some of the threads, googled some screenshots of Kent himself (or &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;), and I have to agree: the man looks like he stepped straight out of &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QCD3J"&gt;When I broached the subject in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack, a number of colleagues said they’d already had this exact discussion with friends. “I have thought this since ep 1 and i did not know it was a thing other people thought!” said one, before sharing screencaps of a group chat on the subject, which devolved into a discussion about how &lt;em&gt;furry&lt;/em&gt; Kent is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42U7Z5"&gt;None of us could put our fingers on exactly why Roy (who is “played” by “actor” Brett Goldstein) looks so uncanny, but we settled on the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AnOTWw"&gt;The man has perfect facial hair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zx4hoo"&gt;Apple loves using soft lighting that makes fabric and skin look oddly smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtEPBk"&gt;The contextual triggers of him being a footballer make one think of &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hyX4Tc"&gt;Is his head maybe quite big in comparison to the rest of his body? Is that rude???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8h3jKG"&gt;And in fairness, TV shows and films are blurring the line between CGI and human actors more than ever nowadays. Think about the appearance of a de-aged Princess Leia in &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &lt;/em&gt;or (SPOILER ALERT) Luke Skywalker at the end of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. Nvidia even did a recent press conference, which included a CGI version of the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang (though only for a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;single, brief shot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Nfx5"&gt;So, yeah, Roy Kent is CGI, I buy it! Why not? For good measure, I’m going to start believing that my boss, family, and close friends are all CGI as well. Maybe one day I’ll be able to join them. At least if I was computer-generated, my beard would look better.&lt;/p&gt;
