    <title>Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio is $200 off for the first time at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yiwLgK"&gt;Microsoft’s intriguing Surface Laptop Studio with an articulating display and a plinth platform to keep cool is seeing its first decent price drop since its release a few months ago. The base configuration that normally costs $1,599.99, and comes with an Intel Core i5-11300H processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgckLqLHhgg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to $1,399.99 at Best Buy for today only&lt;/a&gt;. That’s more than a tithe off the plinth, though you’ll need to have a free Best Buy account to get this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SU5LY3"&gt;This is a good price if you want a laptop that has a display that can be positioned in multiple arrangements, much like the Surface Studio desktop. Though, this deal isn’t for everyone to whom the Surface Laptop Studio tries to appeal, namely creative types who need a lot of horsepower. The discounted configuration has integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, which are no slouch for some light gaming, but it doesn’t compare to the RTX 3050 graphics (in addition to a more powerful CPU) found in the $2,099.99 configuration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5CSGC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917174"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGh0di"&gt;Also at Best Buy, you can get a huge 75-inch Samsung QN84A Neo QLED 4K TV for $1,100 off its retail price, plus you’ll get a $500 Best Buy gift card with purchase. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgckYHL5ttF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The final cost is $1,699.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is a solid price for a 75-inch TV that — based on its specs — should deliver a lot of bang for the buck. While it lacks HDMI 2.1 ports to play Xbox Series X, PS5, or PC at 4K resolution and 120 frames per second, it has a native 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX5qG4"&gt;More importantly for some, it has full array local dimming for an accurate-looking picture, and its “Quantum HDR 24X” spec claims to reach very high brightness levels of up to 2,400 nits. This TV has four HDMI 2.0 ports, and it supports HDMI ARC, which makes it easy to funnel audio from the TV into a soundbar via HDMI instead of needing extra cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fEVtsb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917194"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7ohTQ"&gt;Make way for even more Samsung deals offered at Best Buy. The new Galaxy Buds 2 that released this fall &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgck4N0jcOn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are just about $50 off their original $150 price in the black colorway&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve seen competitive offers at sites like Woot, but that site typically offers the international version of this product, which lacks a one-year warranty for US customers — that’s not the case with the model available at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq2ZIn"&gt;In our review, Chris Welch was impressed with the size reduction from generation to generation, along with good audio quality and extra features (that aren’t a guarantee at this price) like active noise cancellation and a wireless charging case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0ujCY2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXn1c0"&gt;The final Samsung / Best Buy combo I’m delivering today is on this Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha 2-in-1 laptop that’s steeply discounted. Normally $1,049.99, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgclnh9nSpH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $749.99 today&lt;/a&gt;. The Flex2 features a 13.3-inch FHD QLED screen, Intel’s Core i7-1165G7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. This model released over the summer, and it seems like a capable machine for the price. In terms of ports, it sports one HDMI port, a charging plug, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YfjsRJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10627416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zi6lMn"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4CgtAU"&gt;Razer’s Barracuda X wireless gaming headset that includes a USB-C wireless transmitter (and supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $79.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, $20 off its usual price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3hzeIu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Flinks%2Fvizio-giftcard1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you purchase any of these Vizio TVs through GameStop (starting at $428)&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get a $100 GameStop gift card.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>How to sneak into a Bored Ape Yacht Club party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rc2Vop_SwHrdimmfVwDuuokG0Ck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264463/acastro_211210_4923_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You need to own an NFT that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or do you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wSjbVn"&gt;As someone who clears out his checking account every month to pay rent, I’ve been a passive observer of the whole NFT phenomenon rather than a participant. When you can’t afford one anyway, it’s much more tempting to see the technology as a gimmick, the scene’s adoptions of language like “democratization” as half-hearted cosplay for assets available mainly to the very rich, and the whole enterprise as a scam by people too rich to get in trouble for scamming, especially when NFTs mostly look like shit. They look like the kind of thing that in the past might have earned you a modest following on DeviantArt — but these things are getting sold at Sotheby’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pew9hL"&gt;A few weeks ago, though, erstwhile countercultural bible &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; collaborated on a “zine” with the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, saying that they had “built an immersive, fantastical world” and advertised one of their creators comparing themselves to “the Beastie Boys on tour with Madonna.” Steph Curry had one. Another sold for $2.7 million. As of this writing, the cheapest one you can buy is for sale at around 50 Ethereum, about $200,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkxQaz"&gt;I got into a frenzy and skimmed a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; article. It taught me that when you buy or “mint” one of 10,000 available NFTs, an algorithm sorts a bunch of random attributes to create a cartoon of a monkey (the “Bored Ape”) that, while an instantly recognizable variation on the theme, is unique. One is shooting laser beams from its eyes; the next has 3D glasses. One frowns in front of a cyan background; the next grimaces over a mauve background. By virtue of that uniqueness, it becomes an asset, and membership among the owners (the “Yacht Club”) makes it valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FVBDyU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But what about the NFT, the thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11pbXm"&gt;But the article didn’t &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; their value. What was so meaningful in the apes’ aesthetic, which reminded me of Neopets? What was so compelling about the members of the de facto club that had formed among the owners of the exorbitantly priced avatars? But just when it seemed like I was doomed to my confusion, I found out parties were a part of this whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrOl8Z"&gt;More specifically, a “warehouse party,” held at Brooklyn Steel, which is not so much a warehouse, as it is a mid-size concert venue created and owned by the same people who run Coachella (and who just renamed the Staples Center to the Crypto.com Arena). That’s like saying you went to a supper club at Applebee’s. But I like parties, so I figured if I was ever going to find out what the deal with this NFT stuff was, as a nightlife journalist, “NFT NYC” week was my time. A Twitter employee had posted a picture the previous night of a defeated-looking James Murphy at a BAYC party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAjr2d"&gt;I went to Princeton on a scholarship, so a lot of my college friends went to high school with James Murphy. So it was uncanny to see their hometown hero, a veritable titan of New York nightlife, DJing for… whatever this was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4yCkn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGhNUv"&gt;But my proximity to that kind of privilege made me think someone I knew might have a Bored Ape. You needed one to get in, and the blockchain is purportedly so impregnable that people are using it to unlock their apartment doors. But I’d been guested into country clubs before, and this seemed like something similar. Even in college, I always got a voyeuristic thrill from watching how the wealthy behave when they let loose and enjoyed mooching off their open bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgFVU"&gt;My first move was to ask a friend who has posted Instagram Stories of her crypto-trading brother-in-law staring into multiple screens at a standing desk. “Don’t have one, friends sold as well,” the brother-in-law replied to her curtly. “Depreciating asset.” I tweeted, I ‘grammed, I texted college friends who had gone into the tech industry — nothing doing. Mostly, people just wondered what I was even talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkd949"&gt;Then I heard back from H, a former philosophy major who now works for a blockchain company. He thought his boss might have one — why? I explained the situation sweatily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff5vRU"&gt;“I don’t think he’d transfer it to me,” H said, and I felt like I looked silly — like I was betraying how little I knew about expensive financial assets and web 3.0 technologies that will define our society’s future. I had caveated multiple times with “I know this is super weird” and “no worries if not,” but H suddenly announced that his boss could verify his ownership online and text him a screenshot of a QR code. The boss teleworked in from Puerto Rico anyway. He said H could go in his place, and I could tag along as his plus-one. &lt;em&gt;What the fuck? Holy shit. Fuck yes. Let’s fucking go. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5GG8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hype drives value. It was the reason any of us were standing in line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38R1bu"&gt;At 6PM, I took the B43 bus to Brooklyn Steel as I had many times before. Just as I was stepping off the bus, though, H called me. He had wisely gone to the security to ask about the protocol for admission and had been told that they would be checking not for NFT ownership but yellow wristbands that had been given out at a prior event. &lt;em&gt;What? But what about the NFT, the thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars?&lt;/em&gt; Nope, she was just checking for yellow wristbands. That might be a problem, but H and I met up at around 7 and joined the line that curled around the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN7dgv"&gt;In line, I learned my first lessons about the NFT scene. It’s not even made primarily up of people who work in tech. A guy wearing a custom blue tracksuit with his ape printed all over it said he didn’t even get the blockchain stuff and needed H to explain it to him. He was just an investor, he said. Rather than the software engineer types I was imagining, the Bored Ape crowd was full of young, eager-eyed bros, happy to strike up conversation about their own pet NFT projects. It was more like a real-life version of those Twitter spam bots that promise that a certain cryptocurrency is “going to the moon” because NFTs are fundamentally about hype. Hype drives value. It was the reason any of us were standing in line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwTCSm"&gt;It also means the actual aesthetics are shamelessly derivative. The Bored Apes themselves are a shoddy appropriation of the Japanese streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. But in line, the Yacht Club members talked up their own, non-Ape zoo-animal-themed limited avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yo6QfG"&gt;Everyone else, however, had yellow wristbands, and sure enough, another security guard advised us to step out of the line when we neared the front. “But we have the NFT,” we said pathetically, brandishing our QR code screenshot. She had no idea what the fuck we were talking about. I could not believe that, having gotten (by proxy) this one-in-10-thousand cartoon monkey worth half a million dollars, that we were not going to get let in because of, like, resort rules. But we accepted the judgment, went to the nearby bar Tom and Joan’s, and drank for an hour, talking about love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIVX3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I joined the longest line to a mens’ room I’ve ever seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BllUa3"&gt;By around 10PM, we were ready to head home. “Do you want to just go back and try one more time?” H asked. Yeah, fuck it. We decided that maybe if we persisted, we could annoy people long enough that they’d call someone who knew the value of our QR code screenshot. As we stepped into the crowd between the food trucks and the entrance, though, security waved us in without asking us to pull up our sleeves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5JwqA"&gt;The irony was not lost on me that actually getting the non-fungible token had no bearing whatsoever on us being denied entry at first or later when we got in. But honestly, I’ll be chasing the high I felt when we illicitly crossed that threshold for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="N36wAp"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iWWlB1"&gt;Brooklyn Steel was covered in tropical camouflage; over the bar, opposite the stage, a fluorescent “BAYC” logo was glowing, and blown-up Bored Ape portraits tile walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJh4jJ"&gt;The decorators had done a good job, but even when I was in the Yacht Club for the night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the Bored Apes didn’t seem much more impressive than the art in a typical Newgrounds flash game. I figured I must be wrong, though. Art and commerce’s mingling isn’t some new scandal, anyway. I thought, &lt;em&gt;maybe the next great patron of the arts is here tonight.&lt;/em&gt; A hundred years from now, scholarship kids at an art school will claw each other’s eyes out to take classes in a building with his name on it; tonight, he’s doing a backflip in the photo booth, picking up his Stella Artois Cidre, and heading back to the dance floor to try to grind on his coworker to “Reptilia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Bored Ape attendee attempts a backflip at the photo booth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izbkS3i494XS86L_VoAQrv3VTCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076198/IMG_8517.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Adlan Jackson&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bored Ape attendee attempts a backflip at the photo booth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="63UaMc"&gt;The Strokes were there, by the way. We missed seeing Beck get introduced by Aziz Ansari but got in in time to see Chris Rock try to riff on NFTs for 90 seconds and then introduce what must have been one of the first Strokes shows since their fundraisers for Bernie Sanders. “This is kind of about art, right?” Julian Casablancas pleaded from the stage. “NFTs? I don’t know, what the hell. All I know is... a lot of dudes here tonight.” The other members of The Strokes wore stony expressions and gripped their instruments like nervous high schoolers at a talent show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MJkAN"&gt;Casablancas was right about the gender breakdown; I joined the longest line to a mens’ room I’ve ever seen. It was a jumble because while the organizers had booked multi-million dollar comedians to introduce multi-million dollar indie rockers, they had neglected to actually hire anyone to manage the crowd inside the venue; the Yacht Club was being run by a skeleton crew. I don’t know what I was expecting, but I had to notice the failure of the party to live up to any of the futurist promises that drive the value of NFTs. It turns out you actually can’t use the blockchain to work a door or keep a bathroom clean. You can only really do that with labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2y0tU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Brooklyn, if you’re making more money this year than last year, make some noise!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXGhxB"&gt;The relentless peer-to-peer advertising I noticed in the line continued inside as well. It’s one of the more memorable lessons I learned: though I was expecting software engineers getting loose, while the NFT crowd wasn’t cool per se, creating value in a public marketplace requires more social engineering than other tech phenomena. If you can make your ape, giraffe, or pizza popular, it could mean getting rich. So, more stickers were left in the bathroom, and more people are smoking indoors than I’ve seen at any punk show. (Weed, mostly.) And the crowd in this millionaires’ party was noticeably less white than I expected, reminiscent of the Supreme store line crowd of nerds, hypebeasts, and hustlers — diverse but without very many Black people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IGEzD"&gt;And if there’s something that the makers of BAYC did right, it’s encouraging all their attendees to buy merch (that’s where you got the wristband that we don’t have, a merch pop-up). The crowd was full of black-and-white Bored Ape Yacht Club hoodies and T-shirts, which have the look of mid-2010s streetwear, just north of minimal, and the Yacht Club members wore them like frat letters. The energy was very collegiate, sloppy. The partiers didn’t seem to care much about cleaning up their messes. The ground was sticky before long, and the spilled beer smell began rising from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZVXcq"&gt;Drinks were free in the Yacht Club, and thank God, because I had already broken my pledge not to spend any more than my $5.50 in bus fare tonight by insisting drinks were on me at the bar. But we had gotten in late enough that the open bar was starting to run out. I got a Stella Artois Cidre of my own, and The Strokes had gone by then, and a DJ was playing a pretty good hip-hop set by the soundboard. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard a crowd of literal millionaires go up to Bobby Shmurda’s “Hot Nigga.” The DJ ended up being Questlove, and blessedly, he knows to play the censored version in this crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm6Nob"&gt;Lil Baby, the night’s headliner, finally took the stage at around 1AM. Most people had left by then. I was drinking my last vodka of the night and zoning out to “Life Goes On,” though, and a small group of attendees bounced near the front of the stage, and there was something inspirational about Lil Baby’s utter lack of concern with how small the audience had grown and how utterly dry the vibe in Brooklyn Steel was. He had none of Julian Casablancas’ cool kid embarrassment or Chris Rock’s self-consciousness. He was simply getting to the bag. “Brooklyn, if you’re making more money this year than last year, make some noise!” his hype man screamed to the crowd’s delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0gCkz2"&gt;I’m a taker and not a maker, so because unemployment ran out, I don’t think that’ll be quite the case for me. I think he’s got the right idea, though. On the walk back to the bus stop, I found myself a little shook by the diversity of the new class of oligarchs, their expensive sneakers, and their knowledge of Lil Baby lyrics. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned as a scholarship kid myself is that after spending enough time in the borderlands between rich and poor, you could still end up dying as poor as you were born, no matter how many times you party with the rich. However strained the atmosphere of people trying very hard to make a party cool because their ROI depends on it may have been, I thought I might finally be learning to emulate the money moves of the Casablancases and the James Murphies, rather than their subversive poses. They wised up at some point, whereas I still hadn’t learned. Culture is cheap, and the Bored Apes were right to turn it into a token. If only I’d bought in sooner. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Takedown notices are threatening online thrift shops — just as business is exploding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbvty5vUpz7rUo-mA5hp1pZIRy0=/0x143:1996x1474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264319/Clothing_Reseller__Hero.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Small businesses say their livelihoods are threatened even when they aren’t running afoul of copyright claims and trademark&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UI5gcz"&gt;In January 2020, Jade Myers, a successful seller of secondhand clothes on Poshmark, came across a trove of designer swimwear and apparel at a thrift store that she knew would be a hit with her shoppers. She shelled out for dozens of pieces, prepared and photographed them, and listed them on her shop, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fposhmark.com%2Fcloset%2Fornamentalstone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ornamental Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Within days, the listings turned into an intellectual property nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf5mde"&gt;The pieces Myers found and purchased for resale were from the buzzy brand Onia x WeWoreWhat, designed by fashion influencer Danielle Bernstein. After Bernstein was alerted to the Poshmark listings, she &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/dramatic-saga-between-fashion-influencer-weworewhat-and"&gt;jumped into Myers’ Instagram DMs&lt;/a&gt; to beg her to take the products down — they were unreleased samples that had been mistakenly donated to charity by the brand. But when the two weren’t able to reach an agreement on payment after Myers pulled the listings to sell back to the brand, Bernstein took the legal route: lawyers representing the label sent a letter claiming Myers was infringing on their trademarks and copyrights by hosting the goods on her store. Now Myers’ revenue was at risk, and Bernstein was threatening to have her entire Poshmark shop shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4erJFS"&gt;“In my head, I had already accepted the idea that I was going to lose my business,” Myers says. “That’s the point of desperation and sadness that I felt.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sew5C8"&gt;Myers’ experience, which rippled through fashion and reseller corners of social media, is just one example of a phenomenon small businesses say they’ve struggled with for years. List a secondhand product from fashion companies like Michael Kors, Dior, or YSL, and you could soon be facing down an IP notice trying to block or restrict the sale, say online sellers. These takedowns can destabilize independent merchants and jeopardize their livelihoods. And now, sellers say overzealous takedowns are getting more and more intense across different e-commerce platforms, just as consumers are beginning to embrace secondhand fashion over buying directly from manufacturers and big-box retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g45j4v"&gt;The secondhand fashion industry isn’t growing — it’s exploding. An &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/second-none-fashion-resalers-bulk-up-capitalize-booming-sales-2021-10-28/"&gt;analysis by GlobalData&lt;/a&gt; suggests the secondhand market in the US is expected to more than double by 2025 to $76.4 billion, and retailers are trying to claim territory. In June, Etsy bought Gen Z-friendly competitor Depop for $1.6 billion, and resale platforms like Vestiaire, Tradesy, and Vinted have raised hundreds of millions of dollars this year. Brands like Levi’s and Urban Outfitters have launched in-house vintage and secondhand sections in recent years, and luxury labels like &lt;a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a38087452/jean-paul-gaultier-rental-resale/"&gt;Jean Paul Gaultier&lt;/a&gt; — following viral attention on its vintage pieces — are renting and selling their archives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwNXRO"&gt;Vintage and secondhand sellers say that as the field is getting more crowded, they’re running into more speed bumps. &lt;a href="https://revivalspecs.com/"&gt;Jon Hershman&lt;/a&gt;, a seller based in San Diego, California, with expertise in vintage sunglasses, has been working to move the majority of his sales offline — shoppers can try the products on, and there are fewer returns. And critically, navigating online takedowns has become a headache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL59nC"&gt;Though Hershman’s products are authentic vintage, dozens of sunglasses have been removed from his store’s Instagram shopping feed, with Instagram citing third-party infringement. He says some brands tend to get flagged more, like Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, but removal is sporadic — some sunglasses are allowed to stay up, while others from the same brand are taken down. Requests for Instagram to review the removals are denied, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTGE3N"&gt;Instagram says the takedowns are intended to remove counterfeit products and make the platform a trusted place to shop. “Although we do our best, and every appeal is reviewed by a person, we know we don’t always get it right and are always working to improve our approach,” Stephanie Chan, a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WaOoXb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so easy to take something down,” Bowman says, “And it is so, so, so difficult to get something put back up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="txWOL1"&gt;Online vintage and secondhand sellers describe a delicate dance they must do in order to stay in business — and that even when they follow the rules, their shops are at the mercy of the platform-specific policies and the rights holders. Montana Bowman, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBaltoVintage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a longtime Etsy seller&lt;/a&gt; who specializes in vintage hats and clothing, got IP infringement strikes every so often as his business grew over the years. To get his products restored, Bowman has to reach out to the brand directly, convince them the product is used and authentic, and get them to notify Etsy the IP claim is withdrawn. But not every brand returns his emails — a particularly frustrating situation involved a hat from a company that makes truck parts, named Supreme. The &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Supreme, the famous streetwear brand, claimed infringement, despite being the wrong company, and never responded to Bowman’s inquiries, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZamvA"&gt;Then this summer, Bowman got strikes resulting in the removal of three products — a vintage hat by Mack Trucks (now owned by Volvo) and two Jack Daniel’s baseball caps. In late September, still waiting on a response from legal teams, Bowman logged into Etsy one morning to start work only to find a big red banner saying his store had been suspended. (Another seller recounted getting a final warning before possible suspension the day before his wedding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93QTRI"&gt;Bowman was eventually able to get his shop restored, but only after hiring a lawyer to communicate with Etsy. Bowman went weeks without his store, resulting in thousands of dollars in lost income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uOawP"&gt;“It’s so easy to take something down,” he says, “And it is so, so, so difficult to get something put back up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4GidWV"&gt;Etsy declined to comment on the record for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTsBV8"&gt;Legal experts point out that what sellers are doing is allowed: you can resell items you’ve purchased, whether it’s a 30-year-old commemorative T-shirt or a sweater you found at the thrift store that still had the tags. According to the first sale doctrine, once the original owner sells a product, you don’t need their permission to resell it as long as you’re honest about the condition and its provenance, says Yvette Liebesman, a professor of law at Saint Louis University. These legal sales can get caught in a net cast by brands that have a financial incentive to search for counterfeits or unauthorized resellers through takedowns. Small businesses often have no recourse even if they know their sale is legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2a000Z"&gt;Aggressive — and at times unfounded — infringement takedowns aren’t simply an attempt by corporations to claw back lost sales, says Liebesman, who has &lt;a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=350017064003084121075100101087103119097014088087016004031104066030088005066068010030032012051099111045001108067000083113075021058073017052065017069011126017016095004076031119121069116112090026124117083076073089090095084097004017119087093118104084124&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about IP takedowns on resale platforms like eBay. They could also be used to attempt to change the law. She points to two pieces of pending legislation that, if passed, could significantly alter the resale landscape — making it harder for small sellers to operate — under the guise of anti-counterfeit protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le23GT"&gt;The INFORM Consumers Act, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-supports-the-u-s-house-version-of-the-inform-act"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.etsy.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2Fetsy-pledges-support-for-newly-introduced-house-inform-legislation-heres-why-it-matters%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/amazons-ecommerce-bill-bind-house-931f6c00-84bc-45ee-835c-242b34016382.html"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, would require online marketplaces to take additional steps to verify the identities of high-volume third-party sellers. Meanwhile, the SHOP SAFE Act — which has received pushback from online selling platforms — would open platforms up to lawsuits unless they take certain steps to prevent counterfeit products. But Liebesman and &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and"&gt;critics of the bill&lt;/a&gt; say the legislation as-is could end individuals’ and small businesses’ ability to sell products online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTcwZ3"&gt;By racking up takedown notices that are hard for small shops to fight, Liebesman says companies could be “trying to create a climate to encourage Congress to ‘do something’ about this huge problem that they are manufacturing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubAgNe"&gt;“Anytime you buy a resold good or a used good, that’s one you’re not buying from the manufacturer,” she says. “They don’t want the competition of people buying used goods or resold goods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQYafG"&gt;Cases where small sellers begin the legal process are few and far between, according to Liebesman. One oft-cited example is the story of Karen Dudnikov and Michael Meadors, who operated on eBay under the name Tabberone selling crafts made from licensed fabric. Tired of having their listings removed for infringement, the couple &lt;a href="https://nysba.org/NYSBA/Publications/Section%20Publications/Intellectual/PastIssues/SpringSummer2007Vol16No1/SpringSummer2007Vol16No1Assets/IPNewsSprSum07.pdf"&gt;tangled&lt;/a&gt; with Major League Baseball, Disney, Mars, and other corporations, seeking declaratory judgments that allowed them to keep their storefront open while representing themselves in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TqdSUi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like the typical David and Goliath story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDil1S"&gt;Reached via email, Dudnikov says that when she and her late husband began challenging the takedowns in the early 2000s, there was very little information online about what their options for recourse were. Worried they would go bankrupt, they felt they had no choice but to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCAM9n"&gt;“I don’t think I should have had this experience,” Dudnikov says. “Companies know what the law is, but they use their corporate lawyers as bullies to control the secondary market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSwEHW"&gt;Without the money or time to engage in legal proceedings, many entrepreneurs don’t have many options but to accept takedowns, says Lynnise E. Pantin, a Columbia Law School professor who runs a clinic counseling small businesses pro bono. When faced with a copyright takedown they believe to be mistaken, sellers have the option to counter-notice, which formally begins the legal proceedings — meaning a seller is opening themselves up to a lawsuit from the company in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8dhCG"&gt;“A lot of people just decide, ‘I’m just going to do what they tell me to do,’” she says. “It’s like the typical David and Goliath story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXDE6L"&gt;In Myers’ case, tangling over the influencer-branded fashion line, she eventually met with Bernstein in person, coming to a handshake agreement on how to move forward. The saga was a lesson for Myers, who says she now realizes the letter from lawyers was an attempt at bullying her smaller operation into complicity. (Reached for comment, Poshmark director of corporate communications Kelly Mason pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to the official infringement policy. “We’re glad that the two parties came to a good faith resolution on the issue,” Mason said regarding the WeWoreWhat dispute.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQyhm2"&gt;The shift towards secondhand shopping has been a boon to resale apps and sellers, but many small businesses feel increasingly inched out. A flurry of takedown threats can spread panic in the seller community — last month, many &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shopbacktrack/video/7029120776678755631?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8yvTr%2F8Z7dpxN5QrP%2BQMt4wjfIR1GAZEJ5avSHhae0N3Y1X7Ll9zAz5QPSdPkR8HoXU7bTqgR3R4Ykr3DGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=3ee74e7b166546cda7fccd099e0ff09af21eae7fe77d860b902a7b644e4b67e7&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAwm0WRGyGdizTvgkz3ptZpEcVFJff_UxXCp8bZWjZrKS5rqoLxbOGkVAWsJ51O2Gf&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7029120776678755631&amp;amp;share_link_id=60AB05FF-864C-4A67-97B7-3A749818BFBC&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1639061083&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d97igc3kk3b16i&amp;amp;user_id=6757149442048803845&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;sellers on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; realized they had all received the same email from Shopify, notifying them that the platform found branded or trademarked goods in their shop. Sellers were required to fill out a form acknowledging the products and attesting they were genuine or risk losing their stores. (Earlier this month, Shopify was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812956/shopify-textbook-publishers-lawsuit-piracy-copyright"&gt;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in which major publishers alleged it was allowing pirated textbooks and other learning materials to flourish on its platform.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ek3E6"&gt;And while sellers say they’re happy any corporation is trying to divert waste and put usable products back into closets instead of landfills, there’s a difference between the stay-at-home mom who removes a stain just to make $15 on a dress and the company that just began to turn towards resale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ovnJ4R"&gt;“I don’t think they ever really cared until recently,” Myers, the Poshmark seller, says. “Until they saw the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj5mLF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="priATT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N6nMF"&gt;Sony is finally &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/13/new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-arrive-next-month-followed-by-new-ps5-console-covers/"&gt;announcing its own&lt;/a&gt; custom covers for the PS5. The console covers will be available in black, red, pink, blue, and purple, and will work on both the regular PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition. Sony is releasing the black and red PS5 console covers in January in most markets where the PS5 is sold, with the other colors to follow in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7M66A"&gt;The new covers are designed to match the colors found on new pink, blue, and purple DualSense controller options. These new colors will be available in January, with the purple version being sold in the UK, US, and Germany through &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/coming-soon"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation direct&lt;/a&gt; early access program. Other retailers will stock the purple DualSense controller on February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R0SWVt"&gt;Sony is also planning to offer the PS5 black cover on January 21st at its PlayStation direct online store, with availability at other retailers on February 18th. The PS5 covers will be available for $54.99, and the new controller options are priced at $74.99&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okcxNi"&gt;Sony’s announcement of new console covers comes just weeks after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796166/sony-ps5-faceplates-design-patent-playstation-5"&gt;patented its PS5 faceplates&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been caught up in legal action against multiple third-party companies that have sold black faceplates. DBrand faced legal action from Sony, forcing the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;pull its faceplates&lt;/a&gt; and replace them days later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;with a new design&lt;/a&gt; and a marketing campaign that mocked Sony’s team of lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton responds to surprise death in And Just Like That... with new commercial </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zQJfPyWEwJnsRDI-h-zsRt-j8Jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70263745/akrales210108_4344_0103.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvYd2L"&gt;Peloton has responded to a plot-line in HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; reboot, &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/em&gt;, turning around a commercial in less than 48 hours after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;stock continued to plummet&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to events on the TV show over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrczXK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Spoiler warning: the following discusses a major plot point from the first episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Just Like That...)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvMVsV"&gt;The plot point in question involved the sudden death of Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who suffers what appears to be a heart attack after enjoying a 45-minute Peloton workout. That workout happened to be led by a character played by a real-life Peloton instructor (Jess King). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nwy1B"&gt;Peloton says it approved King’s appearance in the show, but knew nothing about Big’s death. “We were not made aware of the plotline,” Peloton’s SVP of global communications Jessica Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over email. “This was a casting opportunity for one of our instructors for an acting role — not an official brand integration or product placement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdo5fe"&gt;Now the company has responded with a commercial featuring Noth and King, in which Noth suggests the pair “take another ride.” A voiceover from Ryan Reynolds reassures viewers that “regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs, and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse, and reduces blood fat levels,” before concluding — “he’s alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UtOqF9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And just like that...he's alive. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bVX8uWypFZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bVX8uWypFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Peloton (@onepeloton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1470132497170239496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bipWhW"&gt;Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the commercial was filmed over the weekend “in collaboration with Ryan Reynolds and his marketing company, Maximum Effort, who created the spot,” and that the whole thing “came together in less than 48 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS9hgy"&gt;It’s an impressively quick turnaround — so quick that you’d be forgiven for suspecting the whole back and forth is a bit of orchestrated viral marketing — but Peloton and Ryan Reynolds do have prior form here. When Peloton released its infamous “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ijof8uw4OHs"&gt;Peloton Wife&lt;/a&gt;” advert two years ago, Reynolds nabbed the same actress, Monica Ruiz, to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ayD-4nMnB44"&gt;appear in a commercial&lt;/a&gt; for his Aviation Gin, with the spot seemingly following the same storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFMm5H"&gt;Peloton’s difficulties go far beyond fictional plot-lines, though. The company’s stock surged during the pandemic as more people were forced to work out at home, but enthusiasm for its products have since cooled. The company also has extremely real and tragic problems involving its equipment. Its &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peloton-treadmill-recall/"&gt;treadmill was recalled&lt;/a&gt; after it caused numerous injuries and the death of a six-year-old who was pulled into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is going to make you pay to start your car with your key fob</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Car Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuXGUyhZUptnuXQP4a0R71GuL2E=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70262746/1230450659.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWECf5"&gt;Toyota is charging drivers for the convenience of using their key fobs to remotely start their cars. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43329/toyota-made-its-key-fob-remote-start-into-a-subscription-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota models 2018 or newer will need a subscription in order for the key fob to support remote start functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svDI4F"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; notes, buyers are given the option to choose from an array of &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/"&gt;Connected Services&lt;/a&gt; when purchasing a new Toyota, and one of those services — called Remote Connect — just so happens to include the ability to remotely start your car with your key fob. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wkTqc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQPoao"&gt;Buyers are offered a free trial of Remote Connect, but the length of that trial depends on the audio package that’s included with the vehicle. Even more confusingly, only some Toyota models support the Audio Plus or Premium Audio packages that the free trial is offered with, which you can check out for yourself in this &lt;a href="https://engage.toyota.com/static/articles/11_25_2020_2021_connected_services_trial_renewal_and_applicability_chart/2021_Connected_Services_Trial_Renewal_and_Applicability_Chart.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrE2qm"&gt;In other words, the key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car. This was first spotted in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/qyyl94/toyota_will_disable_key_fob_remote_start_unless/"&gt;a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, where the original poster added a link to Toyota’s Remote Connect marketing materials (&lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/content/connectedservices/marketing/PDF/Remote_Connect_CFA.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The post has since been flagged as “potentially misleading,” however, Toyota confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; that users will, in fact, have to pay for remote start when the free trial ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXw1Wq"&gt;The pamphlet linked to in the post details the key fob’s remote start feature, as well as its relation to the Audio Plus and Premium Audio packages. While a car with Audio Plus gives drivers the luxury of free remote start using a key fob for three years, a car purchased with Premium Audio offers free remote start for 10 years. After that, drivers will have to pay the $8 / month or $80 / year price for the full Remote Connect service, which includes the remote start feature for the key fob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13v4j0"&gt;On Toyota’s &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/remoteconnect/"&gt;Remote Connect page&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not entirely clear that the key fob’s remote start functionality is included within the plan. It says that the Remote Connect service lets drivers use their smartwatch, smart home devices, or smartphone to start their cars, but there isn’t any mention of using the key fob for remote starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydCP52"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Drive &lt;/em&gt;points out, it looks like some users have been aware of this for years. In a thread dated back to 2019 on the &lt;a href="https://www.toyotanation.com/threads/remote-start-keyfob-works-after-remote-connect-subscription-was-canceled.1656626/"&gt;Toyota Nation forum&lt;/a&gt;, users discuss the key fob’s remote start functionality — some users claim that their key fob is still able to start their car remotely, however most of the users on this thread own a Toyota that’s 2018 or newer, which means they may still be covered by the free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nW1LfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NHmXWH"&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16897326/bmw-apple-carplay-subscription-google-alexa-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;BMW made drivers pay an annual subscription&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Car Play — in addition to the $300 it charges to install the feature in the first place. The German car manufacturer &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;later walked back on its decision&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWLBQD"&gt;However, BMW still does let you pay to “unlock” new features in your car, in a way that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311332/bmw-in-car-purchase-heated-seats-software-over-the-air-updates"&gt;described as in-car microtransactions&lt;/a&gt;. The all-electric Porsche Taycan has a similar system, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/connect/"&gt;Functions On-Demand&lt;/a&gt;, which lets drivers purchase new, optional features for their Porsche, like Active Lane Keeping or Dynamic Light System Plus. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36596/cadillac-super-cruise-needs-a-25-monthly-subscription-to-work-after-three-years-no-matter-what"&gt;Cadillac charges users $25 / month&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the free trial for its hands-free driving mode, Super Cruise, which has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;temporarily discontinued in newer Escalades&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chris Wallace leaves Fox News to host weekday show on CNN’s new streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump And Joe Biden Participate In First Presidential Debate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O9pgdussW6JOvzw4fCoJ8JtoxOg=/2x0:4094x2728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70262208/1228795725.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUpix3"&gt;Long-time &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt; host Chris Wallace is leaving the network to join CNN’s upcoming streaming service, &lt;a href="https://plus.cnn.com/signup"&gt;CNN Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as noted in a &lt;a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/12/12/chris-wallace-cnn-plus/"&gt;press release from CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bbuDOV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new show will be available when its streaming platform launches in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gNVIvw"&gt;The 18-year Fox News veteran &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/chris-wallace-departure-fox-news-channel"&gt;announced his departure&lt;/a&gt; during his final &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, stating that he “wants to try something new.” Sources close to the situation &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/12/media/chris-wallace-leaving-fox-news/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that Wallace’s long-term contract with Fox was expiring this year, and he wasn’t looking to renew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIgLZ2"&gt;Shortly after Wallace’s announcement, CNN revealed that Wallace will be hosting a weekday show on CNN Plus that features interviews with figures from the world of politics, sports, business, and culture. The new show will be available when its streaming platform launches in 2022, serving as just one example of the type of original content that CNN plans on debuting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony WF-C500 earbuds review: basic ain’t bad</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Sony’s entry-level buds stick to the fundamentals&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tjnbvg"&gt;Sony’s new WF-C500 true wireless earbuds have an appealing price of $99.99 and come with a sleeker, more traditional design than the WF-XB700 buds that they’re replacing. Aside from the reined-in looks, they improve upon that model by adding support for Sony’s Headphones Connect app, which allows you to customize the EQ to your liking. The WF-XB700s had the company’s “Extra Bass” branding, but Sony has done away with that this time for a sound that’s much more balanced out of the box. Battery life has also improved slightly to an impressive 10 hours of continuous playback, and the C500s offer easy-to-use controls with large buttons on each earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvYbpB"&gt;But to hit that penny-shy-of-$100 price, Sony left out some major features like noise cancellation, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and even smaller conveniences like automatic pausing when you pull out one or both earbuds. You can often find these useful tricks in similarly priced buds, which can leave the C500s feeling like Sony omitted a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2fC6ja"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10913452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc86aR"&gt;That said, they still sound very good for the price; Sony rarely skimps on audio quality. And while I was worried that switching to a smaller, more discreet physical design would sacrifice the anchored-in-my-ears feeling that the XB700s gave me, thankfully that’s an area where these earbuds continue to be a standout. The question you’ll need to ask yourself is whether those pluses are enough to make up for what’s missing. Where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 earbuds are a lavish luxury&lt;/a&gt;, this set is about as basic as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAqoYE"&gt;Before I get to the earbuds themselves, a few words on the charging case: Sony has downsized it significantly into a more pocketable pill shape. The bottom is still flat, so the case sits nicely on a desk or table even when the lid is open. I also really like that Sony carried over the semi-translucent lid from the XB700s, which makes it easy to see the three amber LEDs inside — one for each bud and the case — and be certain that everything is charging properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lxJIflEif9aiLFr-R9X5ygbhGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076298/cwelch_211208_4922_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WF-C500 earbuds next to Sony’s flagship WF-1000XM4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lp3Cld"&gt;Opening it with one hand can be challenging since the lid uses resistance rather than magnets to stay closed, but it’s not impossible if you push up from the thin indent running along the lip. The case still uses textured matte plastic all around, and while some view this as cheap, I like that it eliminates any potential for scratches or scuffs. There’s a USB-C port around back, and the case has enough juice for one full recharge of the C500s, bringing them from 10 hours of playback to a total of 20. Most earbud charging cases have at least two additional charges’ worth of battery in them, so Sony’s behind the curve there. You can also count out wireless charging, which Sony seems to reserve for its upper-end earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb8Cy0"&gt;The XB700s had a very distinct design that, even at the time, was on the larger side for true wireless earbuds. They also noticeably protruded from my ears. The reason behind the unconventional shape was that it allowed them to twist deeply into the ear canal for a very stable fit and optimal bass response. I liked the fit, but not everyone found them equally as comfortable. With the C500s, Sony is making the latter a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzZvL-ECBdnsuHUwJgd0By3aO8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076302/cwelch_211208_4922_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WF-C500 buds (right) are significantly smaller than the WF-XB700 (left) that preceded them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5ngo4"&gt;They’re still matte all over but are now more compact — smaller than the flagship noise-canceling WF-1000XM4 earbuds — and don’t demand as much space in your ears when inserted. The overall look is close enough to Sony’s premium models to make them both seem part of the same family, though you lose the flashy copper accents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C80swr"&gt;Instead of a touch-sensitive outer surface for controls, the C500s have a large, physical button on each bud. This is a vast usability improvement over the tiny nub that was located at the bottom of each XB700 earbud. The controls remain unchanged (and can’t be customized). The left earbud controls volume: a tap increases it and holding down will gradually lower it. Track controls are on the right earbud: tap once for pause / play, press twice to skip tracks, and three times to go back. Holding the right bud will summon your phone’s voice assistant. Once you get the functions down, they’re easy to remember, and the buttons are clicky enough that you don’t have to forcefully press them (and jam the buds uncomfortably deep into your ears) just to activate the controls. Unfortunately, Sony omitted the common auto-pause feature when you remove one or both earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTeCQRtwDJUIQteTkQPcOTE3UHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076297/cwelch_211208_4922_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case lid lets you easily see when the earbuds are charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pONDlJ"&gt;Three sizes of silicone tips are included in the box. The large size worked about as well as I could ask for, providing a good, reassuring seal and decent noise isolation. Even though they don’t screw into my ears in the same way as the XB700s, the C500s never budged or came loose whether I was eating, talking, or running with them in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7G0ll"&gt;As is typical for Sony buds, the sound doesn’t disappoint. While the C500s lack the expansive, rich soundstage (and powerful noise cancellation) of the company’s flagship 1000XM4s, they come with an excellent, fairly balanced tuning out of the box. The 5.8mm drivers have nicely controlled bass — brought down a rung or two from the Extra Bass XB700s — detailed highs, and well-defined mids that bring vocals through on Taylor Swift’s &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt; rerecording with clarity and presence. Unlike Sony’s previous entry-level earbuds, you can customize the EQ on these if you do want to crank up the lower frequencies or give the treble a little more room to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3rpsGOUP0P-zw2rj_18NVbTM2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076299/cwelch_211208_4922_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The C500s lack the noise cancellation, LDAC support, and richer audio experience of the much pricier 1000XM4s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gBu4Vp"&gt;To my ears, the C500s sound better and fuller than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Jabra’s slightly cheaper Elite 3 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, but the Jabras outdo Sony at noise isolation and also have a transparency mode for hearing your surroundings (or your own voice when on calls). Other similarly priced competition like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;the Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; have a more lively V-shaped EQ out of the box, but I like how flexible the Sonys are with customizing your preferred sound. You won’t get the ANC that comes with the Nothings or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;slightly pricier buds like Anker’s Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;, nor is Sony’s higher-quality LDAC codec supported on the C500s. But the company does at least toss in a small helping of extras like 360 Reality Audio support and the freedom to use either earbud alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="LN4CjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10913459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VoF563"&gt;But voice call quality isn’t a strength for Sony’s entry-level buds, and the experience can be rough in noisy environments. If you’re chatting with someone from a quiet room, they’ll do the job. But my colleagues on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews team cringed and laughed — unable to make out a word I said — when I attempted using them on our weekly Zoom meeting at my crowded local coffee shop. AirPods or Galaxy Buds 2, these are not. I don’t expect groundbreaking clarity for $100, but Sony should be aiming higher here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jhhUki"&gt;Even with poor call quality, as a complete package, the WF-C500s cover the other fundamentals without any glaring tradeoffs or flaws. You can find earbuds that pack in more features for the money, but these Sony’s are dependable, easy to use, last for long listening sessions, and have a sound that punches beyond their price. They’re also more compact and stylish than the oddball WF-XB700s that preceded them while maintaining a great in-ear fit. If all you care about is getting a basic set of earbuds that work consistently and sound good in the process, you can save a heaping of cash and go with Sony’s basic buds. Sometimes less is more — unless you want noise cancellation or other features that demand a higher price. It’s fair to have some pause and consider what you’re giving up, but if you can snag the C500s on sale (at press time they’re as low as $68), they’re far from the worst impulse buy you’ll ever make.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjXXNX"&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois collapsed following a bout of severe weather and tornados that ripped across the Midwest and South on Friday night. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at least six deaths have been confirmed, and a number of workers are still unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lV7Daf"&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/collinsvilleEMA/posts/269327955226516"&gt;A post&lt;/a&gt; on Illinois’ Collinsville Emergency Management Agency’s Facebook page called the collapse a “mass casualty” incident. It &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=269627795196532&amp;amp;set=a.222212819938030"&gt;later posted&lt;/a&gt; an update with a photo of the event’s aftermath, showing a large portion of the warehouse completely torn away by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wNxM"&gt;During a press conference this morning, police chief Mike Fillback told reporters that authorities have had trouble finding out “how many people we actually had at that facility at the time because it’s not a set staff.” Amazon management was at the scene to help create a list of staff members who are accounted for, however, Fillback notes that it’s still difficult to determine how many people remain trapped inside the collapsed building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0gxx"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, at least 45 people reportedly made it out of the facility safely. While some were transported by bus to a safe area and reunited with family, others were able to leave the scene on their own (via &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/least-one-person-dead-severe-weather-event-illinois-amazon-warehouse-rcna8464"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It remains unclear how many people were originally in the building, but as &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes, authorities estimate that 110 workers could've been inside at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ue0N76"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VcgDJ3"&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now,” Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re assessing the situation and will share additional information when it’s available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qo8WF"&gt;Illinois wasn’t the only state affected by the severe storms. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/2-dead-arkansas-possible-tornadoes-heavy-weather-strike-us-rcna8451"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 70 fatalities are expected in Kentucky, while one was killed after a possible tornado hit a nursing home in Arkansas. President Joe Biden sent out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; Saturday morning, stating that the administration is “working with Governors to ensure they have what they need as the search for survivors and damage assessments continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GNg4D7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;(2/2) All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis. We extend our fullest gratitude to all the incredible first responders who have worked so tirelessly at the site.&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1469849247042334721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDq7hf"&gt;Amazon founder Jeff Bezos responded to the incident on Saturday night via Twitter. “All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” he wrote. Bezos had been in Texas that morning for his spaceflight company’s rocket launch that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829232/blue-origin-new-shepard-michael-strahan-six-crew-success"&gt;brought six people to space&lt;/a&gt;, including former NFL star Michael Strahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcuCqF"&gt;“Requiring workers to work through such a major tornado warning event as this was inexcusable,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union. “This is another outrageous example of the company putting profits over the health and safety of their workers, and we cannot stand for this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvn7yu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 12th 2021, 12:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to reflect that there are now six confirmed deaths and that at least 45 workers have made it out of the warehouse safely, as well as added that authorities estimate that 110 workers were in the warehouse at the time. Also inserted a tweet from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and a statement from the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla hit with another lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, and retaliation by management</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHLSLRnmPcOrBzVWzDWOgHcRptY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261756/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzUm8L"&gt;A second Tesla employee within one month has filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment at the workplace, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sued-by-second-female-worker-over-sexual-harassment-retaliation-2021-12-10/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-second-female-worker-fremont-factory-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Erica Cloud, an assembly line worker at Tesla, filed a lawsuit in California’s Alameda County Superior Court, claiming that she experienced “continuous and pervasive” sexual harassment in the factory where she worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1JLYAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6on69t"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Cloud’s lawsuit alleges that her manager hugged and massaged her, and claims that she was also subject to her manager’s vulgar and sexual remarks. It also accuses Tesla of not doing enough to address possible sexual harassment in the workplace. Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her after she brought up the issue to human resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yqI14"&gt;This comes just after Jessica Barraza, a production associate at Tesla, filed a lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791321/worker-sues-tesla-rampant-sexual-harassment-fremont-elon-musk"&gt;accusing the company of “rampant sexual harassment”&lt;/a&gt; at its Fremont, CA factory. Barraza’s lawsuit claims that she was inappropriately touched, catcalled, and subject to sexual comments at the workplace. She also alleges that her managers knew about the harassment, and partook in the same type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bi4sf"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;Tesla was ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; in connection to another incident at its Fremont factory. Owen Diaz, a Black former elevator operator at the company said he experienced racial harassment and discrimination. Tesla employees later &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;proposed a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging racism at the Fremont factory.&lt;/p&gt;
