    <title>Tetris Effect: Connected is finally coming to the Switch in October</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b33RFn"&gt;The greatest &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; game of the last decade is finally coming to the Switch. As a part of today’s Indie World Showcase, Nintendo announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will arrive on the Switch October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU3uZb"&gt;Coming off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335590/tetris-effect-connected-xbox-series-x-multiplayer-expansion-release-date"&gt;timed exclusivity period&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox and Xbox Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected &lt;/em&gt;is the multiplayer expansion of 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator behind the trippy musical shooter &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; combined speedy block stacking with slick and impossibly pretty visuals and sounds. In &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;, classic &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; gameplay remained unchanged. Players still dropped various shaped blocks into brain-pleasing configurations, clearing rows as stacks of blocks slowly piled up. But &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; was also a full-on audiovisual sensory experience complete with colorful sights and chill sounds that added a new layer of depth to the 1984 classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QoQKb"&gt;Released on Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and VR platforms, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; received a multiplayer upgrade in 2020 with &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected. Connected&lt;/em&gt; added online or local cross-platform multiplayer and co-op modes, allowing players to go head to head or work together in search of the ever elusive row-obliterating Tetris. Though initially exclusive to Xbox and Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will hit all platforms later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will let you limit DMs and comments from people who don’t follow you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ICkbKirzqCTZgwRxGHZKtwuyRqg=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710692/limits.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHJKGt"&gt;Instagram has been in the news this summer after Black soccer stars in England were bombarded with racist messages following their team’s Euro 2020 final loss. Today, the company’s &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/protecting-our-community-from-abuse-on-instagram/"&gt;trying to prevent&lt;/a&gt; some of that behavior from happening again with the introduction and expansion of three safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nHQ1a"&gt;Among them is something called “limits.” Turning this on prevents anyone who doesn’t follow you, or who recently followed you, from commenting or sending a DM. The feature is available to everyone globally today, and Instagram points out that it’ll likely be most useful to businesses and creators who expect a flurry of responses. Of course, turning comments or DMs off entirely would also work, but Instagram says this is a solution for people who still want the possibility of positively engaging with their community. The company says it’s also “exploring ways” to preemptively suggest that people turn this feature on when it detects a spike in activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O127Eb"&gt;Additionally, Instagram is building out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;hidden words feature&lt;/a&gt; that launched in April, which allows people to automatically filter DMs with offensive words, phrases, and emoji, relegating them to a hidden folder. The feature now has a wider list of potentially offensive words, emoji, and hashtags. And finally, the app is issuing sterner warnings to people who try to post offensive comments. (This type of messaging already existed but only appeared if someone attempted to post multiple times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFPVTH"&gt;“We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse,” the company writes in a press release. “We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXEeOf"&gt;The racist harassment of the soccer stars — Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, and Jadon Sancho — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; Prince William and UK prime minister Boris Johnson to speak out, along with England’s Football Association. Instagram clearly had to do something, and these new features may offer some help, at least to the people who find them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kidney transplant patients will test a COVID-19 booster shot in new trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Vaccinations Are Rebounding in the&amp;amp;nbsp;U.S. Covid Hot Spots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRyJPIRSHNFyXG29VJz4-fScSoo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710665/1234456149.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vYan8"&gt;The National Institutes of Health is giving a booster&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dose to 200 kidney transplant patients who did not have an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine in a &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-study-third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-kidney-transplant-recipients"&gt;new trial&lt;/a&gt; that launched yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bAm5E"&gt;Many transplant patients, who have to take immunosuppressant drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting a new organ, don’t produce enough antibodies — or don’t produce antibodies at all — after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The study will check to see if a third shot of an mRNA vaccine, given on top of the normal two-shot regimen, will generate antibodies closer to the levels seen in healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJ4I7V"&gt;There are some indications that a third dose might help some people. In France, health officials started recommending in April that immunosuppressed patients get a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Half of the patients who did not respond to two shots produced antibodies after the third, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782538"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 159 kidney transplant patients. The other half, though, still had no response. In Germany, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Citation/9000/Cellular_And_Humoral_Immune_Responses_after_Three.95188.aspx"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; of 48 transplant patients found that 40 percent who didn’t respond to two doses had a response after the third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zknG"&gt;Two other trials looking at kidney transplant patients are also kicking off in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04961229"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-535930/v1"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3yIcV"&gt;It’s possible that the existing body of research might be enough for health officials in the US to start recommending that immunocompromised patients get a third shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will take up the question at its meeting on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzc3lg"&gt;Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are available under an emergency use authorization in the US that specifies two doses for the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots. In order for a third shot to become standard for any group, one of two things would have to happen: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would have to amend that authorization to include the option for an additional shot, or the agency would have to fully approve the vaccines. Once they’re approved, doctors could prescribe a third dose under a practice called off-label use, which lets doctors use pharmaceuticals based on their judgment even if they’re not technically cleared for a particular purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS0EhC"&gt;Some people in the US are already skirting the FDA and seeking out third shots. More than &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-fe8ecebb3b61c7d3ee8ed4225500cb0e"&gt;900 people&lt;/a&gt; have received a third shot in the US, according to data collected by the CDC, and it’s likely an undercount. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Axiom Verge 2, Boyfriend Dungeon, and more are out on the Switch today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzGKE9ryGtcbcq9POv0QmD_668Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710622/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HTeFFc"&gt;Nintendo’s most recent Indie World Showcase was full of lots of cool games, as per usual. But the best part is that many of them are out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U1TGC"&gt;That includes &lt;em&gt;Axiom Verge 2&lt;/em&gt; (a sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/30/8311893/axiom-verge-playstation-4"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;-like adventure from 2015&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; (a hack-and-slash game where you can romance your weapons), &lt;em&gt;Necrobarista: Final Pour&lt;/em&gt; (the director’s cut of a visual novel about coffee and death), &lt;em&gt;Islanders&lt;/em&gt; (a procedurally generated strategy game where players build island communities), &lt;em&gt;Slime Rancher&lt;/em&gt; (where players run an alien ranch), &lt;em&gt;Curious Expedition 2&lt;/em&gt; (described as “a turn-based narrative roguelike set in a reimagined version of the late 19th century”), and &lt;em&gt;Garden Story&lt;/em&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-like action-adventure game where you play as an adorable grape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwnpIp"&gt;Outside of the games coming out today, the event also included a number of titles launching later this year and next. Here’s everything that was announced:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THMm1LPQT1QkkRKivKiO76b6Hco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775959/ss_b0ea46ab638043942f74f165a8f75ecd4a6a4a11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QQ0NDn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4drezg"&gt;The chill, music-based take on &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; is finally getting a portable edition. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; originally debuted on the PS4&lt;/a&gt; before moving to platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335590/tetris-effect-connected-xbox-series-x-multiplayer-expansion-release-date"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258435/tetris-effect-oculus-quest-release-review"&gt;Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt;, and the Switch edition features both the single-player campaign and the more recent “Connected” multiplayer component. It launches on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6JbeK8ywL1u99IpCpgd9tQ_9kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775961/ss_d853013e1cf2ea2e8987f592c6a8edcbcb4ea17a.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eFKeKx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5VQzUx"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;-style game about grinding and graffiti. It’s coming to the Switch as “a timed console exclusive” in 2022. (It’s also coming to other platforms, including &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353230/Bomb_Rush_Cyberfunk/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLJ-GfDbxCNPqB29ClKVSICd2PY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775916/ss_43418d01199ecdf23da6349c5804ce690427016e.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zxw73D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastward&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GevhsB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastward&lt;/em&gt; is described as “an action-adventure RPG with puzzle-solving and dungeon elements” where players explore a post-apocalyptic future rendered in lovely pixels. It’s coming to the Switch on September 16th as a timed exclusive, and preorders are open starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oegeRKHOWYYcpJTPSFV7kEICJoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775962/ss_9b4ab639703869d9f25e175c52ccba8158fc0464.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8bVd1a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="s6uUHb"&gt;A game all about taking photos in a beautiful black-and-white world. The developers describe &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; as an experience about “talking to quirky characters and solving their problems by snapping neat photos, you can make your way through a variety of different, relaxing regions inspired by the Scandinavian countryside.” &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXb6i407sf4UXCmUawztVBD7_As=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775968/SKPocketDungeon_001.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AqfcZO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y53YKh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5844364/shovel-knight-review"&gt;The side-scrolling &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; is expanding with a spinoff that mashes up dungeon crawling and puzzle solving. The game was first announced last year, and the Switch version will be out this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CPlCFMlkJaonV7apkQgceoRYBSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775888/ss_42d03a48ef24ad3f6e7b311b73f9589da3867c98.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Tactics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dLBFFM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Slug Tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wnIAZg"&gt;As the name implies, &lt;em&gt;Metal Slug Tactics&lt;/em&gt; takes the classic run-and-gun game and turns it into a turn-based, tactical experience. It was previously announced for Steam and is expected to debut on the Switch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nCc32c5v4zhZ_8l6xCFZaCXAux4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775970/ss_500e7212653fa6586f7a84c89b4c60be4e425fbb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loop Hero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxcpkb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loop Hero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iMlQI0"&gt;The engrossing roguelike &lt;em&gt;Loop Hero&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22321086/loop-hero-review-retro-roguelike-pc-mac"&gt;launched earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and soon you can play it on the go. The big twist is that instead of controlling the hero directly, you build the world around them. It’ll be on the Switch this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sfip1NrNmbhI9zhTf27yfeHw-E0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775903/ss_4051bb164110660d9b216c9ab1a153464c2b97e1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YBd8om"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XP0Fpl"&gt;Meditative adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/16/17357762/far-lone-sails-game-pc-mac"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Lone Sails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a sequel coming (the developers say you don’t have to play the original to understand) where once again players will assemble their own boat in order to explore a flooded world. &lt;em&gt;Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt; is expected to launch next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpgciJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s everything Samsung might unpack (and unfold) on August 11th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="D7CPc0"&gt;It’s been a little over half a year since Samsung introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229537/samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s21-event-buds-pro-announcements"&gt;the Galaxy S 21&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s time for something new. Luckily, Samsung’s Unpacked event planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s widely expected to introduce new versions of its folding phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsHGW1"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 will likely be the stars of the show, with familiar designs featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;stylus support&lt;/a&gt;, 120Hz displays, and improved durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWrpzF"&gt;Samsung and Google are also collaborating closely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;on Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung is expected to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;new Galaxy Watch smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; to show off with its folding phones, and a look at the future of wearables for Android phones. Don’t be too surprised if there’s a fresh pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; to show off as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byqRSB"&gt;There’s not long to wait now, but if in the meantime you want to catch up on all the details of what Samsung seems to have prepared, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;check out our roundup&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, keep an eye here for all the news as it rolls in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is adding an interactive periodic table to search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emlL7ZCfY_QcAIh8vKMr8TgDBYA=/13x0:2035x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710395/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_4.22.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4rC2s"&gt;Google search now has an interactive periodic table you can check out to learn a lot more about the elements. You can find it by searching for “periodic table” and clicking the “explore elements” button on the right side of the page or by &lt;a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/periodic-table/"&gt;navigating to it directly right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWHAj"&gt;I wasn’t the best chemistry student growing up, but I’ve had a lot of fun clicking on different elements and learning about things like an element’s atomic mass, melting point, and seeing a 3D model of each element, which I find particularly cool. Each element that I’ve clicked on also includes a short fact — like that thallium was used as the murder agent in an Agatha Christie novel, apparently&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GdStO7JH0Jdb37Wlr9TcXEdZpBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774923/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7OGRvK"&gt;The periodic table is being announced alongside a few new features in Google Assistant designed to help families, including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353207/google-assistant-smart-display-speakers-family-new-features-homeschool"&gt;Family Bell reminders&lt;/a&gt;. At launch last year, they could only play from Nest smart displays or speaker, but in “several weeks,” they’ll be able to ring on mobile devices, too, Google says. And sometime soon, Family Bell on the Nest Hub will be able to show a checklist when a Family Bell goes off, which could be a useful way to remember a set number of tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gItQA0"&gt;Google is also adding a way to set a routine after you turn off your alarm in the morning, which could let you check the weather and the news right after you wake up, for example. This feature is also coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMgbnTzstgDC4b5td2N12dRBAKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710337/cwelch_210809_4705_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i9nhWr"&gt;It’s official: Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; are now considered last-gen. During today’s Galaxy Unpacked event, the company announced their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;long-rumored successor&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds 2, a new set of true wireless earbuds that look to refine Samsung’s recent formula instead of reinvent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Eo06"&gt;In terms of design, they’re not drastically different from the Galaxy Buds Plus. Each earbud is lighter and features a more rounded exterior. The Galaxy Buds 2 will also be available in four distinct colors (dark gray, green, purple, and white), and each earbud features a three-point microphone, active noise cancellation, and three sizes of silicone ear tips. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds A-series&lt;/a&gt;, they also come paired with a wireless charging case, one that features a playful interior that matches the color of the buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FKVHPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review: nailing the basics with style","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="agEAD1"&gt;The Buds 2 won’t match the Plus in everything, though. According to Samsung, battery life is estimated to be up to five hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled (the case brings that to 20 hours). If you turn noise cancellation off, you could get 7.5 hours, still short of the 11 hours maximum for the Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx2hNV"&gt;According to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the Buds 2 also don’t have quite the same sound performance as the Plus, offering competent noise cancellation and somewhat mechanized ambient sound. And the Buds 2 are only rated IPX2 for water resistance, as opposed to the Pro’s IPX7.  But they are the least expensive earbuds in Samsung’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKa76m"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds2-olive-sm-r177nzgaxar/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today for $149.99, the same price the Galaxy Buds Plus were upon their debut and $50 less than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. For $5 more, you can add a Galaxy SmartTag. They’ll launch alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G and Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G on August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple settles lawsuit against security startup Corellium</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpYKpHhGBFJZ8jEeW64xHGEjGa4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710313/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAYnI7"&gt;Apple has settled its copyright lawsuit against Corellium, a company that sells virtual iPhone environments for security testing. Apple and Corellium agreed to a last-minute settlement yesterday, just days before a trial scheduled for August 16th. The terms of the settlement are confidential, but Corellium confirmed to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/10/apple-drops-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it would continue to offer virtual iOS systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D0TY8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;Apple sued Corellium&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, claiming the company infringed on its iOS copyrights, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;expanded the case&lt;/a&gt; with more allegations in 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;A judge dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the copyright infringement claims later that year, saying Corellium’s product had a strong fair use case. But the judge let Apple move forward with claims that Corellium violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by breaking iOS copy protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzTLiB"&gt;In its complaints, Apple claimed that “Corellium’s business is based entirely on commercializing the illegal replication of the copyrighted operating system and applications that run on Apple’s iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices.” Corellium countered by saying that Apple was trying to crack down on independent security vendors while launching a competing product. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/apple-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;Court records also indicated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple attempted to acquire the company in 2018 before filing its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYHhLA"&gt;The lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/section-1201s-harm-security-research-shown-mixed-decision-corellium-case"&gt;highlighted the potential chilling effects&lt;/a&gt; of DMCA Section 1201, a controversial anti-piracy rule that has &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/dmca-security-researcher-statement"&gt;cast a pall&lt;/a&gt; over the repair, software archival, and security research industries. Section 1201 makes it illegal to offer tools and services that circumvent electronic “locks” on copyrighted material, with a handful of exceptions that must be frequently renewed. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/dmca-security-researcher-statement"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation published&lt;/a&gt; an open letter encouraging companies to cite the law with “great caution and in consideration of broader security concerns, not just for competitive economic advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 5 biggest announcements from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XImms-ITzAuGvOW-BneXfLqm2Z8=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710306/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.47.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aZhAvZ"&gt;Samsung has finished up its Galaxy Unpacked event, where it announced the next generation of its foldables (it called them the new mainstream of smartphones), wearables, and earbuds. Here are the biggest pieces of news from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wd1CpDaEs3aX-vfgmyHAQ9R2XtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775972/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.37.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Samsung is proud of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;its improved durability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TradUA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has dual 120Hz displays and a stylus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QC2DWS"&gt;Samsung’s flagship foldable has some new tricks up its sleeve, including support for the S Pen, IPX8 water resistance, and an under-display selfie camera for the main screen. It is powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor, and its cover screen (the screen on the front of the device) now runs at an adaptive 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbRECk"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is also getting an experimental setting that will allow any app to be used in the phone’s multi-window mode, even if the developers haven’t designed the app for it. It’ll cost $1,799 and be available on August 27th, with preorders starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lfO5xiKKT1HW-8mbNBXhySE3wQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775987/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.44.49_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;butter yellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; color.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SnBf0s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is coming in at under $1,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzl3Pg"&gt;Samsung also showed off the Z Flip 3, which has the same processor and water resistance as the Z Fold, but comes in at a much lower price, starting at just $1,000. Samsung made the outer screen bigger and more useful than the one on the Z Flip 3’s predecessor and upgraded the main screen to 120Hz instead of 60Hz. Plus, it comes in seven fun colors! The Z Flip 3 will be available in stores on August 27th and can be preordered today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F23SpAv-mGAn3ImVubYeAk_ddts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775904/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.16.29_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s presentation focused heavily on the Watch’s health tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="34UJIH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;Samsung and Google team up on the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MQgpg9"&gt;Samsung announced two smartwatches today, the Galaxy Watch 4 (which starts at $249) and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (starting at $349). Both watches have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617873/samsung-exynos-w920-chip-announced-galaxy-watch-4"&gt;new Exynos processor&lt;/a&gt;, but more importantly, they’re running a long-promised new OS — the product of Google and Samsung &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4/"&gt;combining Wear OS and Tizen&lt;/a&gt;. The watches also feature a bevy of health-related features, including sleep tracking. And if you were worried that a new OS and redesign would mean losing out on genuinely cool features from previous Galaxy watches, worry not. The Classic features the physical rotating bezel that’s been a staple for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KAnnA8ahuBmRnuidqMYCpakVDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776018/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_7.53.15_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smallest and lightest buds from Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Do1mKh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619796/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-features-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 are easy to tote around&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw07V9"&gt;Samsung has announced the latest in its lineup of true wireless earbuds, and they’re coming in some fun colors. The company also says that the Galaxy Buds 2 are the lightest in its lineup and that they’ll include active noise cancellation. The Buds 2 will be available for preorder today for $149.99.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22383705"&gt;You can transfer your WhatsApp history from iOS to Android&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nW775f"&gt;Historically, it’s &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-changing-phones/?lang=en"&gt;been difficult to transfer&lt;/a&gt; your old WhatsApp conversations when switching devices. During its segment on One UI 3, Samsung announced that now, you’ll be able to take your chat history with you if you’re coming from an iPhone. Details are still a bit sparse, but it seems like the functionality will be coming to phones beyond just the Z Flip and Z Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ivRN6s"&gt;Note-ably absent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T1pVoH"&gt;Though new Galaxy Notes are usually announced around this time, we had a good idea that Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;wouldn’t be making a new one&lt;/a&gt; this year. Instead, we saw the Note’s S Pen make its way to the Galaxy Fold. The Note hasn’t stood out as it did in years past with Samsung making phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; that support the S Pen and rock a screen nearly as large. But it’s still considered Samsung’s most premium phone — at least until now. It sure seems like the Z Fold 3 is the Note’s true successor. But Samsung will have to prove that a foldable, not a Note, deserves its place as the flagship-among-flagships this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The hinge and sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucabZwOdxei0q68nbVgjQahmyDQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710243/23.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 strong enough for everybody?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="biWujD"&gt;I was not expecting Samsung’s third generation of folding phones to be water-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz0Uv6"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; have just as many moving parts as previous generations. Phones have been resistant to spills and short dunks for some time, but folding phones add an entirely new level of complication to waterproofing. There are many more ways for water to get in, and some of those ingress points move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzlpM2"&gt;Samsung’s solutions for sealing up those ports are clever, but they’re above and beyond what Samsung’s folding phones really needed: stronger screens. Samsung says that’s happening, too. In fact, in a call with some of Samsung’s lead engineers, I learned why the company believes these phones are sturdy enough to become mainstream devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8mqKzp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 preview: there’s just something about this phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"},{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 injects Samsung’s capable hardware with Google software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"},{"title":"How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381610"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNQqlK"&gt;Samsung has had its share of very public embarrassments. That first Galaxy Fold was canceled before launch because review units broke — sometimes spontaneously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;as mine did&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, there was the fall of 2016 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13202608/samsung-galaxy-note-7-discontinued"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 batteries caught fire around the world&lt;/a&gt;, seriously threatening people’s safety and leading to a recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnM6tY"&gt;But the Fold was eventually released after some changes, and more changes still have been applied to this new generation. And the Galaxy Note — and big batteries in Galaxy phones more generally — also eventually made a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn4gkR"&gt;Samsung keeps trying. And it’s going to keep trying with foldables, where it has a significant lead on the competition and intends to keep it. This year, if you put the stronger screen, a more rigid frame, and that water resistance together, you get a story of a third generation of phones that Samsung hopes will finally put the disaster of the original, canceled Galaxy Fold to rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Va9QW0fvFXrR5thoBg73qj7YMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774800/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Di51k"&gt;There’s no magic secret to making a phone water-resistant. Simply find all the places where water can get in and then seal them — either with glue or rubber gaskets. For a lot of the ingress points on folding phones, you just treat a folding phone as two separate phones. Sealing simple things like speaker holes, USB-C ports, and SIM card slots work exactly the same. Done and done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWJ5d9"&gt;But beyond those ingress points, there are complications and the solutions aren’t as straightforward when you’re working with a folding phone. The problem is movement. Specifically, there’s that pesky hinge, an even peskier flexible screen, and the peskiest of all: wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_blSrPKsjfOCkXTdB2tbBs2zfWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774936/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnxwoVhilAXBpvzSKuTMCnU393o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774812/16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no way to stop water from getting into the Z Fold 3 hinge, so Samsung lubricated the gears inside for protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0TwMhHFhzlM9pMXw7ODUrKdNOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774939/21.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="URQZ86"&gt;There’s simply no way to fully seal the hinge; there are too many moving parts that need to be placed in close proximity. Samsung’s solution for keeping dust out of the mechanism is tiny sets of nylon brushes cut to fit into caps that are less than a millimeter wide. (The company tried both carbon fiber and PET before landing on just using nylon.) It’s not a perfect fix for dust, but it has made a big difference in durability on the second generation of folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc5igM"&gt;But brushes don’t stop liquid. So Samsung just accepted that and instead “developed a special type of lubricant that can really adhere well to all of the small components in the device,” says Hee-cheul Moon, principal engineer on Samsung’s mechanical team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AGYoehVpp7-xvAGIFz5NGV9T-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774945/12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-wysVQhvNm1-AOCqjHqdiJu4OE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774948/22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 surrounds every hole underneath the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYefM"&gt;All lubricant can wear off, but Samsung believes that its lubricant should be good for 200,000 folds. Samsung even doused it with Coke. To be fair, Samsung makes no claims that either phone will stand up to soda immersion. The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 each are rated for IPX8 water resistance, which means they should be able to survive in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. You might be used to seeing IP68 resistance on devices like the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, but the “6” is code for a guarantee of dust resistance, which Samsung’s folding phones lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDY9Lb"&gt;As for the screen itself, it’s composed of multiple layers and Samsung simply sealed it up, using what it calls a pressure-sensitive adhesive. So if water gets in, it will literally flow between the screen and the two bodies of the phone, and also get into the hinge. All of that shouldn’t be a problem, Samsung says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDhGsZ"&gt;Sealing the two sides of the phone required new materials. On folding phones, the screen needs to float a bit above the body. It has to move just a bit when the body folds and unfolds. (You can see this most clearly on the Moto Razr, which has a screen that visibly slides around.) There are holes in the body of the phone that need to be sealed, and for that Samsung developed a thick, double-sided tape. It’s thick enough to allow the screen to slide just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83hiEd"&gt;That leaves one more problem to solve: the two sides of the phone need to be connected with wires. There is no way a simple rubber gasket around a flexible circuit board would work. Those ribbons need to move quite a bit in all three dimensions. Samsung’s fix is super smart: “cured in place gaskets.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cured-in-place gasket for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3. It’s injected in liquid form at the factory and then cures to create a flexible seal around the cable ribbon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqYM1uDIsQ4zoAi2UTshVu0ZPlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774950/6.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ1ghw"&gt;“When it’s dispensed, it’s in the liquid or fluid format,” says Moon. “Once it’s exposed to air, it becomes solid.” Think of it as a kind of flexible epoxy that sticks to the phone and the ribbon to make a watertight seal but still allows for more movement than a rubber gasket could. It’s goo when it’s first applied in the factory, and cured before assembly is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqZLA0"&gt;Is all of this a repairability nightmare? Absolutely. Adhesives are the bane of fixing up phones, and with the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, Samsung has introduced no fewer than three new kinds of sticky materials. Samsung itself offers extended warranty services, and unfortunately, it seems like they might be a very important part of buying these phones — third-party repair shops are going to have a hard time dealing with all that double-sided tape and custom glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5zw7EyqabQhp4gulAmX6vM9IgBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774818/20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dspjB3"&gt;Samsung’s big innovation with the Z Flip in 2020 was using Ultra Thin Glass in its folding displays. But it was an innovation that was hidden under literal layers of plastic. It might have helped with the screen’s durability and making it feel firmer, but the thing your thumb actually touched on both the Flip and Fold phones was still a piece of mushy plastic. (Plus, some phones began cracking at the hinge after some use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYCCHQ"&gt;This year, Samsung needed to solve those problems, add waterproofing, and tackle one more challenge: make sure that the Z Fold 3 would be able to endure having an S Pen stylus tapping and scritching away at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYEsfL"&gt;I have no idea if Samsung can really achieve all of those goals — but making the main screen stronger is the most important thing Samsung could do. It’s the part of the phone that’s most fragile and simultaneously the thing you interact with the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfVjIS"&gt;Samsung says it has rearranged the layers of the screen to improve durability. So now the order is the Wacom digitizer layer for stylus input (on the Z Fold 3 only), then the OLED display itself, then the Ultra Thin Glass, then a protective polymer layer, and finally the topmost layer, a new “Stretchable PET” (Polyethylene terephthalate) screen protector on top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hv7j4fl1rTrX3xGl01NsTH-KdTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774810/14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says its new PET screen protector is more durable and feels more like normal screen protectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn7nZZ"&gt;As with previous folding devices from Samsung, you are absolutely not supposed to remove that topmost layer. Unlike previous folding devices, this new stretchable PET should have fewer “marks of fingerprints and it’s less vulnerable to scratches or dents,” according to Byeng-seok Choi, a senior professional at the Flagship Product Planning Group at Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Wacom digitizer on the Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8i3twSZ5a94hGiWFUlbVe3348Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775301/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.09.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digitizer for stylus input has been split in two, and an algorithm determines location when the S Pen is between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Z Fold 3-compatible S-Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S-Pens." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ETeWv52N6n-kBy17aZDn5tpfV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775299/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.08.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3-compatible S Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUKRKW"&gt;Choi says that for the Z Fold 3, Samsung has achieved “a panel durability which is 80 percent or more higher than our previous iterations.” (Samsung claims it’s 30 percent stronger on the Flip.) He also claims that it should feel much more like the plastic screen protectors that are already commonly used on regular phones, “So, I believe that the users won’t notice much difference anyway, because they’ve already experienced this material.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV4LGO"&gt;My colleagues Becca Farsace and Chris Welch had a chance to see the phones in person and did notice that they seemed to be less likely to pick up fingerprints than earlier folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaAYHx"&gt;As for the Wacom digitizer, Samsung didn’t attempt to make that fold. Instead, there are two separate digitizers on each side of the phone. To the OS, it looks like a single panel — and the gap between them is handled by “a new algorithm” to calculate the stylus tip’s position using data from either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnyJ7Z"&gt;That all sounds good, but the story is undercut somewhat by Samsung’s solution for using an S Pen with the Z Fold 3. Instead of simply allowing customers to use existing S Pens, Samsung is selling a special version with a retractable tip. The tip of the S Pen now has a “rounded, rubber nib” that’s softer than previous versions. When too much pressure is applied, the tip will retract rather than let a user press too firmly on the screen. It’s a complicated solution that makes it clear there’s still a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwJ_trXXw7ykztUKyzZv22F_698=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774825/27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d537fQ"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is using a new aluminum alloy it developed, patented, and branded with a new name: Armor Aluminum. Samsung wouldn’t share what exact metals and processes it used to create it, but Sung-ho Cho, principal designer at Samsung’s Advanced Lab, says the company was “able to reinforce the strength by 10 percent or more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOBrXB"&gt;Samsung showed a brief demo where it knocked a block of its Armor Aluminum up against another block of 7000 series aluminum, which is what’s commonly used on smartphones now. (When a tech company touts “aerospace grade” in its aluminum, it’s usually referring to 7000 series.) The dent on Samsung’s alloy was, as you’d expect, much smaller than the damage to the 7000 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92kzq9"&gt;Samsung is using this new aluminum for the frames and hinges on the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, but it also plans on using it on more phones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWif1j"&gt;Cho says that Samsung stuck with aluminum because of its weight but that this more rigid version of it should help with preventing screen cracks on the outside glass. “It provides such a strong and durable skeleton so that it minimizes the impact on other material,” he says. “It kind of acts as a shock buffer between the different materials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r85Hb3"&gt;Samsung isn’t shy about its stated goal for foldables this year: make them mainstream. For the Z Flip 3, it’s finally brought the price under that conceptually important $1,000 price point. For the Z Fold 3, the price is still very high, but with stylus support and an under-screen selfie camera, it can legitimately replace the Note as Samsung’s spec-forward flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPXMaa"&gt;But price is just one part of what Samsung needs to achieve here. With these durability claims, it’s hoping to remove one more barrier to making these phones feel like normal alternatives to regular glass slabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUlRMe"&gt;The thing about Samsung is that it’s easy to see when it gets things wrong. The screen fritzes out, the battery starts bulging, or the software gets littered with ads. Samsung gets things wrong all the time — too often, really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbqKsm"&gt;But the other thing about Samsung is that it rarely walks away from an idea it believes in. And year by year, Samsung corrects its mistakes with small iterations that don’t draw much attention but do make the experience better. Until one year, quietly, Samsung gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70vuUb"&gt;The only question left is whether this is the year. And if it’s not, can Samsung figure it out before another company finds a way to create a truly great folding phone? &lt;/p&gt;
