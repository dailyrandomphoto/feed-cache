    <title>Microsoft brings Office and OneNote apps to Amazon’s Fire tablets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6n8zy-ESVBoKF8qJawYR251G694=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193974/Fire_HD_10_Plus_Lifestyle_Productivity_Bundle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddn8mz"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Office and OneNote apps on Amazon’s Fire tablets today. Both apps are available in Amazon’s Appstore, with the Office app combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single tablet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46lUFG"&gt;Microsoft is no stranger to Amazon’s Appstore, having previously published apps like Outlook, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass for Fire tablets. This is the first time Office has appeared on Amazon’s tablets, though. Microsoft has essentially taken its Android Office app that’s already available on the Google Play Store and modified it to work on Amazon’s Fire OS — a forked version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1zK1qU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet has slimmer bezels and better specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FPmAeY"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WC1B9D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VVX1QLD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; apps will be available on Amazon’s Appstore in regions where Fire tablets are currently sold. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F27%2Fmicrosoft-365-apps-now-available-for-amazon-fire-tablets%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it has timed the release of these apps to coincide with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet&lt;/a&gt;. The $149.99 Fire HD 10 has a thinner design, slimmed-down bezels, and better specs, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XMBMW3H?ref=ods_tab_dpcc_rvws_trnaprd_rc_nd_ucc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is also offering a $219 b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/firetablets"&gt;undle&lt;/a&gt; with a 12-month subscription to Microsoft 365 in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People who are vaccinated don’t need to wear masks during many outdoor activities, CDC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="People pose for a photo after being vaccinated at the FEMA-..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiabB8gW3P02u-lenhI_E82aAPs=/0x190:4200x2990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193810/1232533336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eDZKag"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, outlining the situations where vaccinated people can stop wearing masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfHs43"&gt;People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and two weeks after the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8VAK2"&gt;The guidelines, announced today by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, give fully vaccinated people more leeway to return to normal activities — recognizing how effective the vaccines are at preventing disease. But they’re complicated, and they ask people to keep track of different mask guidelines for a wide range of situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5C1Mt"&gt;“I am optimistic that people will use this information to take personal responsibility to protect themselves and to protect others,” Walensky said during a press briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpgDZk"&gt;The CDC says that people who are fully vaccinated can stop wearing masks when they’re indoors with other vaccinated people, or with unvaccinated people they don’t live with who are low risk for a severe case of COVID-19. They don’t need masks when exercising alone outside, or when gathering outside with both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. But they should keep wearing masks at crowded, outdoor events like a sports game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFmeUWWB_q9Utflps7iCzoQC0JE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473357/Screen_Shot_2021_04_27_at_12.50.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dVWOE7"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated should still wear masks during most &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22384169/face-masks-covid-19-vaccine-outdoors-mandates-indoors-kids"&gt;indoor activities&lt;/a&gt;, like shopping or getting a haircut. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319514/vaccinated-people-vaccines-cdc-mask-coronavirus-social-guidelines"&gt;Early guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC cleared people who are fully vaccinated to spend time indoors, unmasked, with other vaccinated people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXUBix"&gt;“This is complicated, but complexity is the price for allowing people to go without masks early,” said epidemiologist George Rutherford of the University of California, San Francisco, told &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;. “If you want simple rules, then we just wear masks until every last one of us is vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmum7z"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated. More and more data shows that the vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;overwhelmingly effective&lt;/a&gt; at protecting people from COVID-19, and that people who are vaccinated are very unlikely to catch the virus and pass it to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab’s first PC desk keeps your cables under control with the help of magnets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp4-uBdWiftQr8dyULGTVQLe9Vg=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193704/Secretlab_MAGNUS_main.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secretlab’s Magnus Metal Desk.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Secretlab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUSxhG"&gt;Secretlab, which you may know for its gaming chairs, is announcing its first-ever PC desk — the Magnus Metal Desk — and the company has a smart solution to help you manage your cables: you’ll be able to attach magnetic cable-management accessories right onto the desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvzHF5"&gt;The company will offer proprietary accessories like magnetic cable holders to keep your phone’s charging cable from slipping off your desk and a magnetic cable sheath that can be attached to one of the desk’s legs. The desk has a cable tray in the back you can use to store cables as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkoYz6"&gt;The Magnus desk doesn’t just use magnets to help hide cables, though — Secretlab is also making a desk mat that attaches magnetically so it will stay in place while you’re gaming or working. The company calls it the Magpad Desk Mat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7a8uEWaOJjzI3HkINcDpDP0tbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473287/Secretlab_MAGNUS_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Secretlab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magnus’ magnetic cable holders and the cable tray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOoUuS"&gt;And if you want to add a little color to your desk space, Secretlab is also offering a magnetic RGB lighting strip that connects near the back of the desk. You can see it reflecting off the back of the desk in the photo above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGyiwr"&gt;The Magnus desk is 29 inches tall, but you can also manually raise the desk up as much as 0.8 inches higher to help make it the right height for you. But that still means this won’t offer as much height flexibility as a desk that can swap between sitting and standing positions. The desk will also be offered in two lengths: 59 inches, which is available now, and a smaller 47-inch model, which will be available “later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzz9ys"&gt;The desk itself starts at $449, and it will be available in the US, EU, and Singapore at launch. The magnetic accessories will cost extra.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford takes its first step toward producing its own electric car batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ee_7gQMUaXLUBt6ePSpJtfX501s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193185/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j4ZMtl"&gt;Ford announced the launch of a new battery development center in Michigan, the first step toward taking on some of the burden of building its own battery cells for electric cars in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqM5m0"&gt;The new “global battery center of excellence” will be called Ford Ion Park and will be based in Southeast Michigan. Ford said the purpose is to conduct research on how to go about making its own electric vehicle batteries. A team of 150 experts will work on ways to build EV batteries that are long lasting, quick to charge, and sustainable for the environment. They will also develop a process for making batteries quickly, cheaply, and at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4j1Xvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SS5od"&gt;But Ford Ion Park, which will open late next year, will not house any actual battery manufacturing at scale. There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center, said Anand Sankaran, the center’s new director, but the automaker will have to build a new factory to build EV batteries at scale. Ford would not provide a timeline as to when it anticipates launching its own battery cell production line, nor whether it would build a new factory to house battery manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LqTCbcG9mC93TUGC_1mOwExamN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473107/BatteryFacility_AllenPark_11.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSG66O"&gt;“It’s really for us to develop that expertise and competency in house and give us that flexibility in the future,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief platform and operations officer. “So stay tuned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di2vGB"&gt;Ford, which is still in the early stages of its transition to electric vehicles, has said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267195/ford-electric-autonomous-investment-29-billion"&gt;spend $22 billion on the shift&lt;/a&gt;, including $7 billion on autonomous vehicles, through 2025. The majority of vehicles it plans on producing will be battery-electric vehicles, but the company also has hybrid and plug-in hybrid models with traditional internal combustion engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8gFQl"&gt;Ford just started delivering its first long-range EV, the Mustang Mach-E, despite some initial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;hiccups with software updates&lt;/a&gt;. It also introduced an all-electric Transit van last year and plans on unveiling an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;bestselling F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YYddn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bCUbE1"&gt;It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards in the future if Ford can successfully supplement production from its own suppliers. Ford currently sources its batteries from South Korea’s SK Innovation, which recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could to avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZVUl0"&gt;Despite these plans, Ford will have to move more aggressively if it hopes to catch up to its competitors like Tesla, Volkswagen, and General Motors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387129/gm-lg-tennessee-ultium-battery-factory-spring-hill"&gt;GM is building two battery factories&lt;/a&gt; in the US with its partner LG Chem, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;VW recently unveiled its own plan&lt;/a&gt; to have six “gigafactories” in Europe by 2030. Tesla, meanwhile, is in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451469/tesla-battery-day-news-announcement-elon-musk-updates-highlights"&gt;early stages of making its own “tabless” battery cells in-house&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="065gE9"&gt;As recently as last July, then-CEO Jim Hackett said there was “no advantage” to Ford making its own battery cells. But Jim Farley, who replaced Hackett in October, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27T26B"&gt;took the opposite stance&lt;/a&gt;, describing the manufacturing of batteries in-house as a “natural” step as EV volumes grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQV3B5"&gt;According to Thai-Tang, the new center is a signal of how serious Ford is about building its business around the manufacturing and selling of electric vehicles. “We’re much more bullish and aggressive on how fast we think this transition is going to play out,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrtkS5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose no longer requires you to make an account just to use its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5XrFitUIcOi-c8mzWiA4l1PZ78=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193061/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITjLQM"&gt;Recent Bose headphones and earbuds have come with a somewhat frustrating requirement: to use the accompanying Bose Music app, you needed to create an account. So if you wanted to, say, customize the noise cancellation of the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to make a Bose account just to access those important controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eITGqt"&gt;Now Bose is doing away with the needlessly annoying mandatory account. The update notes for the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;latest version of Bose Music on iOS&lt;/a&gt; say “when you set up your Bose headphones and earbuds, you can skip creating an account and get right to enjoying your product.” That’s the way it ought to be. (Bose previously had &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/articles/HC2547/productCodes/noise_cancelling_headphones_700/article.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this help article up&lt;/a&gt; for customers with “privacy concerns regarding data collection and account information” — but acknowledged that headphone functionality would be “limited” for people who didn’t give in and use the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4Xl0a"&gt;Most headphone makers weren’t being nearly as pushy as Bose about making an account; you don’t have to create one to use apps from Sony, Sennheiser, Jabra, and so on. So I’m glad to see this change. Bose says customers can still create an account later from the settings menu if they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeFx5x"&gt;The latest Bose Music also improves the experience for owners of the company’s speakers and soundbars “with faster and easier access to your product controls, favorites, and music services.” There’s also now a graphical EQ interface for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC now lets you directly buy Vive repair parts through iFixit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="vive space pirates" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDLJoseY5BG2s1yOIbK3VXUqmAU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192939/Vive_Space_Pirates.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QicUrB"&gt;HTC has partnered with iFixit to make its Vive virtual reality systems more repairable, selling a list of screws, cables, adapters, and other standalone components directly to consumers. &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/04/26/vive-ifixit-repair-partner/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, HTC says the move is aimed at helping people whose headsets are out of warranty or potentially no longer being sold. iFixit also offers repair guides for the original Vive, the Vive Pro, the original Vive controller, and the Vive Pro Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1pe4"&gt;HTC confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this is the first time consumers have been able to order many of these replacement parts directly. A few listings, like a $3.99 controller lanyard, wouldn’t be hard to find through other sellers. But VR headsets are specialized and niche devices, so if you want a replacement foam pad ($19.99) and set of headphones ($59.99) for your Vive audio strap, or you’ve lost the power adapter for your link box ($19.99), this is a lot more reliable than hunting for an unofficial replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhvlgy"&gt;The Vive, first released in 2016, has always been a relatively modular headset compared to the Sony PlayStation VR or Oculus Rift and Quest lineup. HTC has released several upgrade kits with features like wireless streaming and eye tracking, some of which have been later integrated into standalone headset packages. (Its latest module is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;a lip tracker&lt;/a&gt;.) The consumer-focused Vive Cosmos — which iFixit doesn’t list an official guide for — comes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145156/htc-vive-cosmos-series-announced-elite-play-xr-faceplates"&gt;multiple variants&lt;/a&gt; with different swappable faceplates. The entire Vive ecosystem is built on top of Valve’s SteamVR, and some pieces are cross-compatible with the Valve Index. As HTC keeps building out its ecosystem, a home repair option seems like a natural fit for the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Legal chatbot firm DoNotPay adds anti-facial recognition filters to its suite of handy tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCu15NxD4Hvg6YLXLpwvlClMmPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192915/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BPTk4B"&gt;Legal services startup &lt;a href="http://donotpay.com/"&gt;DoNotPay&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its army of “robot lawyers” — automated bots that tackle tedious online tasks like canceling TV subscriptions and requesting refunds from airlines. Now, the company has unveiled a new tool it says will help shield users’ photos from reverse image searches and facial recognition AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PKCte"&gt;It’s called Photo Ninja and it’s one of dozens of DoNotPay widgets that subscribers can access for $36 a year. Photo Ninja operates like any image filter. Upload a picture you want to shield, and the software adds a layer of pixel-level perturbations that are barely noticeable to humans, but dramatically alter the image in the eyes of roving machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my0SDE"&gt;The end result, DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is that any image shielded with Photo Ninja yields zero results when run through search tools like Google image search or TinEye. You can see this in the example below using pictures of Joe Biden:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0s0eovwN3CpJp68Xibogpus36c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473043/biden_before.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoNotPay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before Photo Ninja, you get plenty of results from Google Image Search (top) and TinEye (below). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4bGsXLquZL1HZBh3R_G4V6bJH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473044/biden_after.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoNotPay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Photo Ninja, the image yields no results in reverse image searches. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fwNIrj"&gt;The tool also fools popular facial recognition software from Microsoft and Amazon with a 99 percent success rate. This, combined with the anti-reverse-image search function, makes Photo Ninja handy in a range of scenarios. You might be uploading a selfie to social media, for example, or a dating app. Running the image through Photo Ninja first will prevent people from connecting this image to other information about you on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dknKn"&gt;Browder is careful to stress, though, that Photo Ninja isn’t guaranteed to beat every facial recognition tool out there. When it comes to Clearview AI, for example, a controversial facial recognition service that is &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table"&gt;widely used by US law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, Browder says the company “anticipates” Photo Ninja will fool the company’s software but can’t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHLg1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Photo Ninja isn’t a silver bullet to beat facial recognition services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aHEWQK"&gt;In part, this is because Clearview AI probably already has a picture of you in its databases, scraped from public sources long ago. As the company’s CEO Hoan Ton-That said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/fawkes-tool-protects-photos-from-facial-recognition.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year: “There are billions of unmodified photos on the internet, all on different domain names. In practice, it’s almost certainly too late to perfect a technology [that hides you from facial recognition search] and deploy it at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFCMNz"&gt;Browder agrees: “In a perfect world, all images released to the public from Day 1 would be altered. As that is clearly not the case for most people, we recognize this as a significant limitation to the efficacy of our pixel-level changes. Hence, the focal point and intended use case of our tool was to avoid detection from Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U5bOj"&gt;DoNotPay isn’t the first to build this sort of tool. In August 2020, researchers from the University of Chicago’s SAND Lab created an open-source program named Fawkes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353810/facial-recognition-block-ai-selfie-cloaking-fawkes"&gt;performs the same task&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Browder says DoNotPay’s engineers referenced this work in their own research. But while Fawkes is a low-profile piece of software, very unlikely to be used by the average internet consumer, DoNotPay has a slightly larger reach, albeit one that is still limited to tech-savvy users who are happy to let bots litigate on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM295M"&gt;Tools like this don’t provide a silver bullet to modern privacy intrusions, but as facial recognition and reverse image search tools become more commonly used, it makes sense to deploy at least some protections. Photo Ninja won’t hide you from law enforcement or an authoritarian state government, but it might fool an opportune stalker or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRQ2fS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Orochi V2 wireless gaming mouse has astoundingly long battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPv-tkN9EDCFqABemC33NTPURS4=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192711/razerorochilede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id1t33"&gt;Razer’s new $69.99 Orochi V2 is a wireless gaming mouse that promises &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;long battery life. It can apparently last up to 950 hours on a single AA battery when it’s in Bluetooth mode or up to 425 hours if you toggle its wireless switch to use the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that can deliver lower-latency performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFcwY7"&gt;Alternatively, you can use an AAA battery for a slightly lighter weight. Razer says you’ll get approximately a third of the longevity this way compared to an AA battery. Still, it’s nice that either size of battery can power this mouse for many, many hours. Razer includes a USB-A dongle near the battery slots, which is accessible by lifting up on the mouse’s magnetically attached shell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GHs3rB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Available in white or black, or you can customize it for $20 more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nJwHLo"&gt;Good battery life is useful for any kind of workload, but it’s especially nice to have for gaming, which is what the Orochi V2 was designed for. This mouse feels similar in some ways to the Razer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price"&gt;Basilisk X Hyperspeed&lt;/a&gt; — another budget-friendly battery-powered mouse with two wireless modes. The Orochi V2 has a textured scroll wheel, angular main mouse buttons that are slightly concave to keep your fingers steady in-game, and two thumb buttons. It’s a smaller mouse overall than the Basilisk X Hyperspeed, yet Razer built it to cater to several grip styles, including claw, palm, and fingertip grips. It is symmetrically designed, though not ambidextrous. A concave thumb rest and the two thumb buttons cater to right-handed gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZrb7MscFmdDJDBUsd9Z2OEvvR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471480/razerorochiv2batteries.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It can hold a AA battery or a AAA battery but not both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EHeTuT"&gt;As for the specs, the Orochi V2 comes in matte black or white and weighs around 71 grams with a AA battery or 64 grams with a AAA battery. It features mechanical mouse switches that have a 60-million click lifespan and uses Razer’s 18K DPI 5G optical sensor. The mouse’s underside features PTFE feet that help it glide easily across a mousepad. Near the scroll wheel, the Orochi V2 has a DPI switcher to adjust sensitivity. It doesn’t have any LEDs, aside from the power indicator next to the DPI-switching button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2RgMN"&gt;The Orochi V2 in black is available at &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-orochi-v2&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRazer-Orochi-V2-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse-Black%2F735296861&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The white-colored model is selling at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916MW7CG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy, and &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-orochi-v2&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a different color or design, Razer is launching a site where you can create an Orochi V2 with a custom look, picking from (according to the company) “over 100” different designs. The customized model costs $89.99 — a $20 premium over the standard option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VhMsOb"&gt;The company has also released universal grip tape for your tech. It’s a $9.99 kit filled with different sizes of textured tape that you can stick to a mouse, keyboard, controller, or anything else you want to add some grip to. That’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091DD8FTH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s next animated short expands the complex world of Soul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="22 vs. Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_vBtVJ_OuFKpLmriV_aGRz8iMA=/381x0:1667x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192686/22vsEARTH_ONLINE_USE_ss881_3_cs.sel16.347_copy.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JM2t0b"&gt;From the very beginning of Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, 22 — a soul who refuses to come down to Earth — is cynical. She hates the idea of inhabiting a body or finding her inspiration, instead being content with spending eternity in the “great before,” a space meant to prepare souls for their human lives. Viewers don’t really get a sense of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she feels that way — but that’s about to change in the upcoming animated short &lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMZLQS"&gt;“I didn’t want the short to be a mirror of what she was like in the feature,” says director Kevin Nolting, who also served as lead editor on &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;. “In looking at what the story would be, the interesting thing for me is what makes her who she is in the feature. This is one of those incidents. In the beginning she was one of those innocent souls; what was the process to make her the cynical soul she is when Joe Gardner shows up? This is just one step in that process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfnUcD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; is a prequel, though it’s not clear how long before &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; it’s set. In it, 22 — once again voiced by Tina Fey — tries to gather a crew of adorable, innocent souls in order to stage a rebellion of sorts. Things, naturally, don’t go according to plan. Nolting notes that the story takes place around the “mid-point” of 22’s story. “For maybe a few hundred years she’s gone through this series of disappointments, and now she’s going to do something about it,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mkp4UT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I operated on the assumption that people would’ve seen the feature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXes6i"&gt;It’s the kind of origin story the team at Pixar considered including in &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, but they ultimately decided against it so they could keep the focus on protagonist Joe Gardner. The team also explored a few different ideas within the &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;universe for the short, including stories based on both Terry — the stuffy accountant from the “great beyond” — and another on Mr. Mittens the therapy cat. But Nolting says 22’s origin “just seemed to be the most natural fit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Y5bIi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJUnC2j9rgo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TLPd8F"&gt;It did introduce some problems, though — namely, figuring out who the audience is. Many of Pixar’s shorts are standalone stories, but given how complex the universe of &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; is, Nolting and the team decided that &lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; had to be a companion piece. It was just too difficult to explain how its vision of the pre- and afterlife worked in a film that lasts just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5UDtq"&gt;“We struggled on the feature [film] where we had 90 minutes to play with,” explains Nolting. “We struggled with how do you introduce this world, how do you make the rules clear, while making it dramatically interesting. So to have to do that all over again, and in a five minute short, that would eat up all the time. I operated on the assumption that people would’ve seen the feature, they’re familiar with 22, they’re familiar with the mechanics of the &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCVeEb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; will debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1042726/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on April 30th, and it manages to capture many of the same feelings of existential angst as &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; — just in a much smaller and cuter package. For Nolting, it was this mix of flavors that made the project so interesting. “I just love the contrast of the innocent and the cynical,” he says. “That was the big appeal for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
