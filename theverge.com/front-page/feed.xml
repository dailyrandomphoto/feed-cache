    <title>LastPass is going to become an independent company</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LogMeIn is making LastPass an independent company.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eOfXkZ"&gt;LogMeIn plans to spin out password management tool LastPass as a standalone company, it announced Tuesday. With the change, LastPass is promising that customers will receive enhancements on an “accelerated timeline” next year. “With a team solely dedicated to its continued innovation and growth, [LastPass] will be able to deliver even more strongly for users,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdyvAY"&gt;LastPass, which LogMeIn purchased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/9/9486343/logmein-buys-lastpass-for-125-million"&gt;for $125 million in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, is a popular password management tool; it’s used by “more than 30 million users and 85,000 businesses worldwide,” according to LogMeIn, and “the significant majority” of its business is corporate customers. LogMeIn’s emphasis on LastPass’ corporate use in its press release could suggest the standalone company is going to focus more on that audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abDw3C"&gt;The change arrives almost a year after LastPass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;added significant restrictions to its free tier&lt;/a&gt;. LastPass now limits free users to only viewing and managing passwords on mobile devices &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; your computer. To access your passwords on all your devices, you need to be on a paid plan. If you’re still on LastPass’ free plan and want to move to another password manager, we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;a guide you can follow right here&lt;/a&gt;. LogMeIn has also been criticized for tripling the price of LastPass Premium &lt;a href="https://www.bruceb.com/2019/06/lastpass-learns-the-wrong-lessons-about-price-increases-from-logmein/"&gt;between 2017 and 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there are “no plans” to change LastPass’ pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAberS"&gt;The shift is taking place nearly two years after LogMeIn agreed to sell itself to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lastpass-parent-company-sold-to-private-equity-firms"&gt;two private equity firms for $4.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s plan to save the smart home </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH3xc4NgYaMz_QI9ezoQSF9g1nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268903/acastro_211117_4887_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Matter is a new standard that promises to fix smart home interoperability — but can it deliver?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t5qLmO"&gt;The smart home should be a natural evolution of our homes, bringing better appliances, better systems, better experiences. But to date, it’s been complicated, confusing, and expensive. Walled gardens have stifled innovation as developers focus on getting their devices to work with three or four or more different platforms rather than spending their time creating better products and new features. Consumers spend too much energy figuring out which product works with which and then troubleshooting those connections, before often giving up on the whole thing. This has led to a slower smart home adoption than many expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtd7u"&gt;What the smart home needs, and has needed for a long time, is a universal connectivity standard — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip"&gt;basic level of common plumbing in our homes&lt;/a&gt; for everything to flow through. Just as we chose VHS over Betamax in the ’80s (and Blu-ray over HD-DVD in the early 2000s) for a better home theater experience,  so we need to choose a smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEbHC"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsEraa"&gt;The problem is there aren’t two or three standards to choose from. There are many, and none of them work very well on their own. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth have all tried and failed to become the primary radio protocol of the smart home. But none have gained enough traction or offered enough flexibility to fit into all corners of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2P9z"&gt;That’s where Matter comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-Z-nOK7Q7nT95Yzp7aVixVZfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079856/acastro_4887_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vtaYcE"&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home. Set up that new device with your favorite smart home app, and control it with your voice assistant of choice, no matter who made it. This may sound like some distant smart home nirvana, but this is the promise of Matter. The simple smart home could be just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow3RE"&gt;An open-sourced connectivity standard created by over 200 companies, Matter is a communication protocol that leverages existing technologies — Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ethernet — to allow all of your devices to communicate with each other locally, without the need for a cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2Fle3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUilte"&gt;What makes Matter more than just another smart home standard is momentum; most of the industry is on board. Organized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (or CSA, formerly the Zigbee Alliance), Matter is being developed by Amazon, Apple, Google / Nest, and Samsung, alongside many other smart home and smart home-adjacent companies, including Wyze, iRobot, Signify (Philips Hue), Ecobee, &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVbU8O"&gt;Driven by a shared need to fix the problems of the smart home, these companies are working together to figure out how to make this standard be the one that sticks. Can Matter finally bring an end to the confusion perfectly encapsulated by Randall Munroe’s classic xkcd “&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;Standards&lt;/a&gt;” comic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeplUXpmj1adDXyyVOg8H8OzwcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084306/standards.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comic by xkcd&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNB9Yx"&gt;“This is a Renaissance [for the smart home]” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. “Most of the industry, if not all the industry have agreed that [Matter] is going to be the way this will happen.” They are seemingly all on board with the fact that Matter is the solution to the smart home’s biggest problems — simplicity, interoperability, reliability, and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhf5Ct"&gt;The final Matter specification, SDK, and certification program should be ready by mid-2022, and the goal is to have the first Matter-certified devices available by the end of 2022, says Richardson. That’s over a year later than promised when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Matter first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L8H9co"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What matters about Matter, the new&amp;amp;nbsp;smart home standard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22596168"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETdn7w"&gt;If you have already boned up on what Matter is and why it… matters, and you just want to know what devices you can buy and when, head over to this “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22596168"&gt;What matters about Matter&lt;/a&gt;” article, where we look at what the different smart home platforms have committed to supporting around Matter and which devices are Matter-ready. Otherwise, read on to learn about how Matter is going to fix the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="up26W0"&gt;What is Matter, and why is it different?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4HCM"&gt;Matter is a unified connectivity technology for the smart home. It is not a smart home platform like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa. Matter doesn’t automate or control your home; it simply provides the pipes and language for devices to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow3IDq"&gt;Its unique feature is it’s an IP-based technology, meaning it uses the same mechanisms to communicate as the internet. So, there is no dependency on bridges or hubs, and yes, you will (eventually) be able to get rid of all those white boxes hooked up to your modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGjgMI"&gt;To simplify adoption, Matter will start as an application layer on top of existing IP technologies, including ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth (for device provisioning). This means Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr_XaQQMw4yPG4CCnnPWSA7QnDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084404/start_developing_with_matter_graphic.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Silicon Labs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter network map from Silicon Labs shows how devices will connect to each other, to the internet, and to other protocols using Wi-Fi, Thread, and Matter controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5QDBu"&gt;Once in your home, Matter devices can operate entirely locally, talking to each other over Thread and Wi-Fi and not going through the cloud. That means if your internet goes down, your smart home will still work. Devices will still need to communicate with the internet for out-of-home control and firmware and security upgrades, which will happen directly or through a Matter controller device (i.e., a smart speaker, smartphone, or bridge). Local control is a significant step in maintaining privacy in the smart home, a big concern for people when considering installing smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wACI89"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"},{"title":"Google commits to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"},{"title":"Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQBxti"&gt;Smart home company Eve built its entire business model on local control. “Our privacy platform is ‘what’s at home stays at home,’” Jerome Gackel, Eve Systems CEO, tells me. “With Matter, you do not need a cloud — you can have one, but it’s not a requirement.” Its commitment to avoiding cloud control is why Eve devices have been iPhone- and HomeKit-only thus far. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;But with Matter, Eve can move to the other platforms while remaining entirely local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8145w"&gt;What is Thread, and why is it better?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xzuPtx"&gt;Thread is one of the key technologies of Matter. It promises to make the smart home more robust. Like Z-Wave and Zigbee, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol. “Networking is one of the biggest problems of the smart home; sensors and devices dropping offline,” says Tony Fadell, founder of Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYWAK"&gt;Nest first developed Thread and the precursor to Matter, Weave, in 2014. Thread’s big selling points are speed and reliability. A motion sensor will turn your lights on in a millisecond compared to a second, and your network won’t go down because you accidentally unplugged the hub, as — with enough devices deployed — a Thread network can self-heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DXX7rddXUr9CI8ZEM-AOaIqdQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079855/acastro_4887_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidoTm"&gt;Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, Thread was specifically developed as a smart home protocol. Other protocols used in the smart home to date have been co-opted into that role, meaning they have practical and usability issues. Wi-Fi is too power-hungry for battery-powered devices. Bluetooth has range limitations. Zigbee and Z-Wave require dedicated hubs, which are cumbersome to set up and maintain and can be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="rgpygN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOt5EO"&gt;Thread began in Nest’s earliest days. “Every single Nest thermostat since the beginning has shipped with a Zigbee radio inside, a connection for a long-distance, low-power protocol,” says Fadell. The idea was to future-proof a device likely to stay in the home for 10 to 20 years. “We wanted it to be able to talk to the future smart home,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5W7LAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10917556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGPb0G"&gt;But Zigbee wasn’t progressing fast enough for the Nest team, so they worked with Silicon Labs to develop Thread, which, in technical terms, is a Zigbee hardware stack with a software layer on top. “We knew what needed to happen — we needed a home IP-based mesh network with low-power range,” says Fadell. “The key is it’s IP native.” Low-power radios in the smart home have needed a hub or bridge to talk to the internet, but that problem went away by making Thread IP native. “That is what is so powerful about it,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbCEvG"&gt;Eve was one of the first smart home companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;to adopt Thread&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;working toward&lt;/a&gt; running all of its relevant products on the protocol, having shifted over from Bluetooth. “Thread has really changed the reliability of our product, especially in terms of automation,” says Eve’s Gackel. “The difference between our Bluetooth product and Thread product experience has really increased customer satisfaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzG3vv"&gt;Thread devices can be battery-powered or wall-powered, and the latter can be a Thread border router, a bridge between a Wi-Fi and Thread network. But a border router isn’t a typical white plastic box type of bridge that plugs into your router. The tech will be built into any device with an always-on power source and can be placed anywhere in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhyyS"&gt;A smart plug, smart speaker, fridge, TV, thermostat, and Wi-Fi access point can all be Thread border routers. “As you add more border routers in the home, you get better range and reliability,” explains Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google and a member of the CSA board. Case in point, the aesthetically pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements light panels are also Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt;, with a smidge more pizazz than a white plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPRjYl"&gt;A border router is like a mailman: it routes the different packets of information. Unlike a smart home hub, it doesn’t know what’s in those packets or control them. If a smart speaker wants to know the state of a lock, the border router can tell it without ever knowing the state itself. “From an end-to-end security perspective, that routing aspect provides a lot of benefits,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H15wWa4XdQiKA-u_uMYDtxrcm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084334/Thread_home_network.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Thread Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image illustrates how Thread border routers connect a thread network to the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2UoA3"&gt;While Z-Wave and Zigbee will continue to be part of the smart home — existing hubs can be upgraded to Thread or bridged to Matter — it seems possible these technologies will be phased out in the residential setting. “It would certainly seem, if everything is executed as promised, that it will make sense to move towards Matter products,” says Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. “That’s a big ‘if,’ however, and there are other questions in terms of security still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH0cQK"&gt;Because Matter devices can speak straight to the internet, that potentially exposes them to hacking or malware, says Klein. &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time), and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Richardson of the CSA. IP control is central to the function of Matter, and Richardson argues that the approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NAK1hc"&gt;How will devices work in a Matter smart home?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEu7g"&gt;The Matter home will need a Wi-Fi access point and a Matter controller. This can be a smartphone or tablet, but it can also be a Thread border router that works with your preferred smart home ecosystem — such as an Amazon Echo speaker, an Apple HomePod Mini, a Google Nest Hub, or a Samsung SmartThings hub. While devices will work across platforms, automations and routines will not. “If you are using HomeKit, you will need a HomeKit hub,” explains Gackel. “A Google hub will not run HomeKit automations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18wsbx"&gt;A Matter home will be able to incorporate any smart home device that is Matter certified. (The Matter logo on a product will indicate that it’s compatible.) You will also be able to set up any Matter device with your controller app, similar to how Apple’s HomeKit works today. All this means that when you buy a new product — such as a lightbulb or door lock — if it has a Matter logo, you won’t need to worry about what it works with; it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzZFQeRI68rbbFLbOOvkuQFJUvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079854/acastro_4887_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omRzdU"&gt;It will also be simpler to set up. Amazon’s Frustration-Free setup is the basis for Matter’s standard setup process, explains Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. It’s designed to enable a “zero-touch” experience, where you take the device out of the box, plug it in, and it connects to your home automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYr8J"&gt;This doesn’t mean there won’t be manufacturer apps, just that you won’t have to use them for setup. Still, in some cases, you will need them to access device-specific features that aren’t available in Matter, and probably to update firmware, although this may happen through Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="07kogK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies are committing to Matter, but some are still holding a few cards close to their chest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye0GAi"&gt;Despite the coming together of the big four smart home companies and the general excitement of the early Matter push, the reality is the smart home will still be a divided one. Matter may provide a basic standard of interoperability and portability, but companies will still seek competitive advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hf077"&gt;For example, nothing in the Matter spec requires a Matter controller to support all device categories. If video doorbells become part of Matter in the future, Amazon could choose not to support doorbells in its controller. Amazon’s Ring doorbells already work in the Ring app and with its Echo devices, meaning the company may see no need to develop another doorbell camera controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14a8Uc"&gt;There’s also nothing compelling companies to upgrade products that they don’t want to. Google has said it will update its newest Nest Smart Thermostat to Matter but has not said if any of the three generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Thermostat E will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9K51y"&gt;Amazon has released a slew of new smart home products in 2021, including a thermostat, air quality monitor, and smart switches, with not a mention of Matter compatibility. DeCenzo tells me this doesn’t mean it won’t come, but that’s not exactly a guarantee that it will. “It’s hard for a device maker to make any absolute statements about something they’re going to support that isn’t here today,” he says. “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSoSVS"&gt;Apple has committed to Matter but hasn’t commented on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;whether it will adopt the Matter TV and Streaming Video player specification&lt;/a&gt; to allow Matter controllers to cast content from smartphones to televisions, similar to how AirPlay works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvRGFc"&gt;On the one hand, companies are committing to Matter, but with the other hand they’re still holding some cards close to their chest. While it’s legitimately tricky to say how you will develop your products for a specification that hasn’t been finalized yet, these companies are all deeply involved in the process, so they are hardly flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9GBupl"&gt;How will companies differentiate themselves in Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1PALNF"&gt;Before Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons for you to choose their devices over the competition. “What Matter does is change the game, so companies aren’t competing on connectivity and interoperability, and it’s just there,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at Connectivity Standards Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAJeQ"&gt;This would appear to put the big four smart home platforms on an even playing field. If all devices talk to each other, you’re no longer locked into Google’s ecosystem because your preferred door lock only works with Google. While this would seem counter to Google, Amazon etc. selling more devices, what it does is make it easier for each company to innovate and move forward with their respective visions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEoO9"&gt;Ultimately, if the hardware is commoditized, the value becomes in the service layer your ecosystem of choice adds to your experience. Matter’s specifications are designed to be simple: that door lock will lock and unlock. “Above that, it’s up to the device makers, the platform companies and such to understand how to best innovate,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNHPu2ISjAQ9HIH0veWWCi2RLGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079853/acastro_4887_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQGuK0"&gt;If you want more advanced features — such as adaptive lighting or touch-to-unlock — you will go to a platform or manufacturer that supports those. “It will make for a more competitive environment,” says Kevin Kraus, of Yale Residential, part of Assa Abloy. “If you want a fully-featured door lock, you’re likely to buy a Yale lock. But let’s say you’ve got a shed, and you just need something that locks and unlocks, then you might go for something less sophisticated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQDR3K"&gt;Matter should push manufacturers to innovate, too. “We need to focus more on the added value of our products,” said Florian Deleuil of Netatmo in &lt;a href="https://matter-smarthome.de/en/interview-en/matter-is-pretty-changing-the-game/"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, it could end up being difficult to distinguish our product from that of cheaper and less innovative suppliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzVx9B"&gt;While it will be more competitive, the thinking is that the market will be much larger. Matter will help the smart home go from niche to mass. “If this is successful, everyone sells more,” says Z-Wave’s Klein. “Market penetration increases, the stagnation of the smart home in terms of growth is going to increase, and new product categories will open up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKvkw"&gt;Today, you might choose a washing machine because it has an excellent design, a special cycle for athletic wear, and offers good energy and water efficiency. You don’t choose it because it works with Alexa or syncs with your fridge. Going forward, that’s probably how you’ll choose your next smart device. “Both industrial design, the overall physical user experience, and the feature sets that they virtually interact with will drive purchase decisions, not just who it works with,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bs8hP"&gt;Matter will also provide wider choice. Today, you may be limited to devices that work with the platform you have set up. With Matter, that restriction should go away. The smart home future — where all devices communicate with each other to help your home run more efficiently, intelligently, and seamlessly — will finally emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj5xICvNyLceaIMRUUBHTfPr1fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084331/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bNpJsc"&gt;But will it Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IdBNMP"&gt;In all of the interviews I did for this article, no one had anything negative to say about Matter (on the record). Right now, the industry is aligned on drinking the same Kool-Aid. But Matter is still an idea — albeit one with an unprecedented industry coalition behind it that makes it the most promising development in the smart home since Alexa arrived on the scene. It’s easy to love an idea; it can be harder to implement and stick to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBsr0h"&gt;Matter’s biggest roadblock is that it’s not here yet, and whether it will arrive as promised is still a large question mark. This is holding some companies back from committing to it or developing products for it today. “We totally believe in the vision and in all the benefits that will come from having a single protocol,” says Amazon’s DeCenzo. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get there. And that’s going to be a journey.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Rns5ld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work well with its platform? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt3pay"&gt;Fadell, who is as excited about the validation of his Thread gamble as a kid at Christmas, is also slightly skeptical. He worries that proprietary moves by companies looking to differentiate products could harm Matter’s overall promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niOU16"&gt;“Everything can talk to everything in Matter, but that doesn’t mean the experiences will be the same. I can speak French, but am I really French? No,” says Fadell. “It’s the same thing here. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, sure you may work with other systems in certain ways — but inside Apple, with all the Apple tools, it will be a better experience, and it’s going to stay that way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0NJ9"&gt;Yes, you will be able to use an Apple speaker to control an Amazon device, but is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; with its platform? “Unlikely,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP75wL"&gt;Ultimately, Matter isn’t the solution we — as consumers — have been waiting for. On day one, it’s not going to produce the ambient, self-aware smart home that can respond to your every need without a lick of set-up on our part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FQcQSu"&gt;What it is is the solution smart home developers need so that they can start building products and services for that smart home we’re waiting for. “If Matter only changes a couple of things, we will still have a fundamental new technology that works,” says Fadell. “And if it’s adopted — well, let’s see what happens then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCXfRy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What matters about Matter, the new smart home standard</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_eg4_5q_a6w0zgsI-D2pd5mYm8=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268938/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Products that are Matter-compatible will have the Matter logo on them.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CSA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How Amazon, Google, Apple, and Samsung will work with Matter, and which products you should buy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GabSAa"&gt;Matter, the coming smart home standard that aims to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22551770"&gt;the answer to many of today’s smart home headaches&lt;/a&gt;, is supported by a long list of companies. From platform owners like Apple, Google, and Amazon to major manufacturers such as Samsung and LG and smaller, accessory-focused players like Nanoleaf, Eve, and Wyze, there’s an unprecedented industry coalition behind Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="167Ytr"&gt;A common language for smart home devices to communicate, Matter aims to simplify everything about the smart home, from purchase, to set up, to everyday use. Its biggest promise is that it will enable smart devices to work with each other, across platforms and ecosystems, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MnDeS8"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lutl1l"&gt;But Matter hasn’t yet arrived — it’s now expected to launch in mid-2022 — making it hard to determine how it will work in your home and what it will allow you to do that isn’t easy or even possible today. To answer some of these questions we’ve gathered information from published documents and talked to the companies that plan to support it and the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (CSA) that oversees Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SLaHUi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s plan to save the smart home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22551770"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n7Wouf"&gt;Consider this article a living FAQ on all things related to Matter; how this new smart home standard will work and which products it will work with. As new information comes out, we’ll keep this article updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQDCM2XNmiFedkryyuLbBkZf71k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858528/Apple_HomePod_mini_iPad_iPhone_applewatch_airpods_10132020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has committed to supporting Matter products in its HomeKit smart home platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="S7Ne2e"&gt;Which platforms will work with Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qVMRLo"&gt;The four big smart home platforms, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Samsung SmartThings, have all committed to supporting Matter, which means you will be able to use their apps, smart speakers / displays, and smart voice assistants as Matter controllers to managed your connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F25agy"&gt;Bear in mind, though, these won’t be the only players that can run your smart home with Matter, and as more information emerges around how other ecosystems will support Matter we’ll add that here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49W3b3"&gt;With Matter, you can use multiple platforms at the same time because of a feature called Multi-Admin control. As long as devices and platforms are Matter-enabled, you can connect them to as many platforms as you want. So, yes, you will be able to control the new Nest Thermostat with Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistants, even both at the same time if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBefjC"&gt;But you will still need to use a smart home platform; Matter is not an automation tool, it’s a connectivity standard. While Matter will have some basic controls built in, it isn’t capable of creating automations, such as setting your thermostat to turn down, your lights to turn off, and the door to lock when you leave home — you’ll still need an app for that type of automation setup. However, with Matter, those automations will run across devices from different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjwIlN"&gt;Here is a rundown of what each of the smart home platforms has committed to in terms of Matter support in its products and services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZZYvfP"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cLXJ2K"&gt;Amazon has committed to upgrading its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;fourth-generation Echo smart speaker to Thread&lt;/a&gt; and act as a border router. Thread is a primary protocol used by Matter and a border router is a bridge between a Thread network and a Wi-Fi network, the other protocol used by Matter. Amazon’s mesh Wi-Fi network company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has committed to supporting Matter&lt;/a&gt;, too. Most of its existing routers already have Thread radios inside, so they can be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1kwXl"&gt;The Echos with Zigbee on board — the Echo Studio, Echo Show 10, and Echo Plus — have the same radio as the Echo fourth-gen, so they are potentially upgradable to be Thread border routers, says Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. This is because Thread and is built on a Zigbee radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCMMvB"&gt;DeCenzo confirmed that the rest of the current Echo speaker line up will be upgraded to support Matter over Wi-Fi. “All of the Echo devices will be able to control all of the Matter devices that are on your home network, regardless of what networking technology they happen to use,” he says. The &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/matter"&gt;company has also said it will work with developers&lt;/a&gt; to help them develop products and skills for the Alexa smart home that will integrate easily with Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGYWIVPY2ntLUniO0QjQaOR7mkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19170903/dseifert_190905_3634_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max has a Thread radio inside and will be upgraded to Matter and serve as a border router and Matter controller, according to Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K1laCp"&gt;Google Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OnQcE4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444571/google-interconnected-matter-smart-home-standard-android-nest-details-io-2021"&gt;committed to updating all its Nest smart speakers and displays&lt;/a&gt; to Matter, and said that newer products with Thread built in — such as the Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub Max, and second-gen Nest Hub — will also serve as border routers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6yynh"&gt;Interestingly, the Nest x Yale Lock has a Thread radio inside, as do all the wired Nest Protect smoke alarms, the Nest Learning Thermostat (all three generations), and the original wired Nest cameras. However, Google told me that just because a device has Thread doesn’t necessarily mean it will be Matter compatible. “Our goal is to make as many of our products Matter compatible as possible,” says Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google. “But much of that will be dependent on the technology needed by the protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5M5PU"&gt;Similarly, Google has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;support developers who make products for its platform to integrate those with Matter&lt;/a&gt; via a Google Home Device SDK for Matter. It also plans to update its mobile devices with Matter support to control Matter devices and allow for Matter’s streamlined device set-up process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3U62vs"&gt;Apple HomeKit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mkEFtJ"&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) both have Thread radios inside, can work as Thread border routers and will get Matter support. Apple has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10298/"&gt;committed to supporting Matter&lt;/a&gt; on the Home app and through Siri on Apple devices. The company has also said that all existing &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"&gt;HomeKit APIs will automatically work with Matter-enabled accessories&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz2vxT"&gt;“We believe all smart home accessories should work together to provide the most choice and interoperability for customers without compromising security and privacy,” Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me. “This is why we helped create and contribute to the new Matter standard so that all smart home accessories will have the same level of security, privacy, and ease of use that Apple customers enjoy today with HomeKit accessories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qv4eej"&gt;Samsung SmartThings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mmIaYV"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"&gt;said it will upgrade all existing SmartThings hubs to support Matter&lt;/a&gt; and enable Matter as a controller for its smartphones, smart TVs, and smart appliances (such as its Family Hub refrigerators). It has yet to confirm if this will be over Thread or Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Au6Ep"&gt;“We’re very excited about the future and utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like,” says Samantha Fein, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing at SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBoJ04RehFWIUVpQxiYkTCp0UYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560470/Elements_7x_Dining_Winter_4000x2250px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A number of Nanoleaf’s products have Thread radios, and the company has said they will be upgraded to Matter when the standard arrives. Its Elements LED wall panels (pictured) will also work as Thread border routers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sCWUu8"&gt;Which products will work with Matter, and when can I buy them?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="bO50Dm"&gt;While you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Thread-Benefits"&gt;Thread products today&lt;/a&gt; from Eve, Nanoleaf, Eero, WeMo, and Nest — and there are plenty of Wi-Fi-enabled smart home devices out there — Matter products don’t exist yet. They won’t until the standard is finalized next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNLTMM"&gt;However, many companies have committed to supporting Matter in existing and forthcoming products. When they do, you will know if a product you’re considering buying is Matter compatible if it has the Matter logo (which looks a bit like a &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/project-chi-new-name-matter-2622"&gt;stick-person wearing bikini bottoms&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWLSSzhz-BNT3G-8mFsUtOtt9ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085210/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matter logo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJFsm"&gt;Matter 1.0, the first Matter spec, includes these connected device categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dt3YCb"&gt;Lightbulbs, light switches, lighting controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GyBRxV"&gt;Plugs and outlets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HnkszA"&gt;Door locks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BOAvFY"&gt;Thermostats and other HVAC controllers (mini-splits etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GyKaEy"&gt;Blinds and shades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0jyqlF"&gt;Home security sensors (motion, contact, CO / smoke detectors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FaMOw0"&gt;Garage door controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nIU45S"&gt;Wireless Access Point and bridges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yBV09P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;Televisions and streaming video players&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8lVDrX"&gt;Work has already begun on Matter 1.1, Matter 2.0, and beyond. Robot vacuums, home appliances, EV charging, and smart energy management are all likely to be in Matter 1.1, says Chris LaPré, chief technology officer of the CSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBjvzl400OzMIQsaiMDthMbPZkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881764/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_keypad_credenza_rgb_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ring Alarm Pro from the Amazon-owned company does not support Matter over Thread, says the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jpYOu6"&gt;Which products won’t work with Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5PrpZq"&gt;While the list of devices Matter will support initially is impressive, the big question is what about smart security cameras? Easily one of the most popular devices in the smart home, a smart home standard without security cameras feels incomplete. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Cameras are probably 2.0,” says LaPré. “We know we will do cameras — all the companies have said they want to do cameras. But we need a quorum of people that are willing to start working on it today, and the ones that would be are currently focused on 1.0.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeyyZi"&gt;In the same vein, while home security sensors are part of Matter, home security systems are not — yet. Many smart homes run with an alarm system as the main hub, so the lack of integration here could be a deal-breaker for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meA5MK"&gt;Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance — a technology used widely in home alarm systems for door / window sensors, motion sensors, and other devices — explains that there will be significant challenges to porting that technology to Matter. “Securing UL approval for security devices is exceptionally difficult, and Matter has numerous challenges here,” he says. “UL is a benchmark and often an insurance requirement. All professionally-installed security systems insist on UL approval.” UL (formerly called Underwriters Laboratories) is part of the CSA, however, and we can assume it’s working toward integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SODx2n"&gt;Speaking of cameras and alarm systems, one of the biggest smart home companies in both these spaces — Ring — hasn’t offered any indication it will support Matter. When I asked how / if Ring Alarm might integrate into Matter, a spokesperson provided the following statement: “Ring Alarm Pro does not support Matter over Thread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="MyBfao"&gt;Is Matter going to keep my smart home private and secure? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NyZeZC"&gt;Smart home adoption has been seriously hampered by concerns about privacy and security, and keeping devices secure is &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;a core tenant of Matter&lt;/a&gt;. “We are secure by design, we take a zero-trust approach, we use specific industry-standard encryption technology, and every device gets authenticated before it joins the network,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at CSA. “Every message is secured on the network, and Matter supports secure over-the-air updates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRqGMA"&gt;In terms of your home’s data, that relationship remains between you and the individual manufacturers, says Mindala-Freeman. However, &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s Privacy Principles&lt;/a&gt; outline data privacy protections, including minimizing how much data is shared in any Matter interaction and defining the purpose of data sharing when requested. As a bonus, because Matter has trust built into the system, you won’t have to continually input your passwords to connect ecosystems, explains the CSA’s LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2EIlm"&gt;The significant advantage of Matter devices, direct IP control that lets them speak straight to the internet, is at the same time a possible security concern. “This exposes them to hacking, malware, etc.,” said Mitch Klein of Z-Wave Alliance. With Z-Wave and Zigbee systems, you have a single point of control to secure: the hub — whereas a single point of securing the home is the opposite of what Matter is doing, Klein points out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUWHSm"&gt;The CSA says &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is more modern, delivering security that is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time) and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. The approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world, “rather than security by obscurity.” Until devices are out in the wild, it’s hard to confirm this approach’s proficiency, but the intent checks all the right boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="philips hue" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBijTaQpzCRMvJoNzLgRsflqiNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4124096/D2-Heart-of-your-Hue-system-square-2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philips Hue smart lighting line will be upgraded to Matter through its existing bridge, according to the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mEr5qU"&gt;Will I need to replace my existing smart devices to use Matter? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1Fr5p9"&gt;From the beginning, Matter has been designed to include those connected devices already in our homes. “We can’t leave devices behind, or this whole program won’t work,” says Klein. “The idea that everyone has to throw everything out and start again is just not going to work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnlhnX"&gt;Newer Wi-Fi or Thread devices and those that work over Z-Wave and Zigbee should be upgradable to Matter. This can happen in two ways: upgrading the device directly over the air or a software upgrade for a product’s existing bridge — &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210512-complete-philips-hue-range-to-be-compatible-with-new-smart-home-connectivity-standard-matter"&gt;Philips Hue has already committed to this for its smart lighting line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR5Twe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the long run, Matter will take over, and eventually, you’ll just get rid of all the bridges.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3DtIvL"&gt;Bluetooth devices that don’t rely on bridges, such as Eve’s line of security and sensor products, will need hardware upgrades, meaning older devices won’t be compatible. Eve has already rolled out upgraded hardware for its Bluetooth products and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;committed to having everything Thread-enabled by next year&lt;/a&gt;, ready for Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyhL6q"&gt;Existing Zigbee and Z-Wave devices are unlikely to be upgraded individually — because they can’t communicate directly to the internet. Despite Thread being based on Zigbee, very few devices with Zigbee radios will be upgradable directly. “IPv6 carries a heavy software burden and the majority of Zigbee devices out there could not support [that],” says Klein. But the hubs these devices communicate through can be upgraded or bridged to Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA3sGH"&gt;But going forward, the Matter smart home should be bridge-free. “Matter is going to be cheaper for device makers, it’s going to be cheaper for Philips, for example, to make an IP-based bulb [than continue to build bridges],” says LaPré. “So, in the long run, Matter will take over, and eventually, you’ll just get rid of all the bridges.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmRJ2-4XCAJgc7bv5uCtOORQiXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21977839/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo smart speaker (fourth-gen) is the only one Amazon has confirmed it’s upgrading to Matter so far, but it says others will be coming soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PPefPz"&gt;Should I wait for Matter to buy new smart home products?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DtH8AA"&gt;This promise of future upgradability means you don’t need to wait for Matter to buy new devices, says Mindala-Freeman. “You should, with confidence, continue to develop your own smart home and smart environment,” they claim. But, as anyone who has bought a smart device knows, the promise of future software updates is not one to bet your house against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pDDCq"&gt;Still, the message from the industry is don’t stop buying devices altogether. Our advice is to consider products with Thread radios in them first, then Wi-Fi, as both of these have a clear upgrade path. If that doesn’t suit your immediate needs, look for products with hubs or bridges that contain either protocol. Beyond that, research the company you’re considering buying from to see if it has made any commitment to Matter — but proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z83JLG"&gt;If you are itching to get started with your Matter smart home, the best device to buy now would be a Thread border router. Products are currently available from Apple, Nanoleaf, Eero, and Eve, with support coming to Amazon Alexa and Google Home smart speakers and displays later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uihsmd"&gt;While Matter will work over Thread and Wi-Fi — meaning you don’t have to have a border router to use the standard — adding one (or more) will help ensure you have a solid foundation on which to build a Matter-supported home. Because Thread is a mesh network the more devices you have on it the better the range and reliability will be. A border router will bridge your Thread and Wi-Fi devices, ensuring everything in your home can talk to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CT5l2T"&gt;Fortunately, a border router is not a bridge in the traditional plug-a-white-box-into-your-router sense. They don’t need an ethernet connection, they just need continuous power and Wi-Fi connectivity. This means a border router can really be anything from a smart plug or smart speaker to a fridge, television or thermostat. Finally, the smart home is starting to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KO2UsiRk_sylLL1GCQvDsU23Fq0=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/VRG_ILLO_4902_SECURE_TWITTER.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can’t keep Twitter out of your data completely, but you can lessen the damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of your information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a few minutes to find them and turn them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpKGc"&gt;There is a single page on the web where you can find a lot of the settings, called the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt;” page. Unfortunately, that page no longer seems to be available on the mobile app. So while we’ll initially discuss the settings as found on the web page, I’ll also tell you how to get to each feature on mobile. (To get to any of the mobile settings, you’ll always start by tapping on your personal icon in the upper left corner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87rMEq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZZUCLB02fnkc5Cg51cBnkbMINI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025630/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNsoti"&gt;If you’re using the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bou6OE"&gt;Find “Personalized ads” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Ads preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zJi3kO"&gt;Find “Personalize based on your inferred identity” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ajPoAd"&gt;Find “Personalize based on places you’ve been” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZfBbK"&gt;Find “Allow use of where you see Twitter content across the web” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vXMOx"&gt;Find “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Data sharing with business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M6gpp3"&gt;Find “Personalize based on precise location” (which is not available on the web settings) by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O5scKT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each (along with directions if you’re using the mobile app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.) In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas: a listing of other accounts that have access to your account, and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account and shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access. In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what Twitter meant when it asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here. This info can also be found in your mobile app under: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted. On your mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Mute and block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLh0uFDEVnMduIatE8w4GIZbzT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025633/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t find anything similar using the mobile app, but you can go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Content you see &amp;gt; Topics. There you’ll see some of the topics you’ve followed and that Twitter suggests you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity. In your mobile app, go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Your account &amp;gt; Download an archive of your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="rSaR8N"&gt;[Note: A reader (@hex on Twitter) sent a tip on how to find these data settings on mobile. On your Twitter app, tap on your personal icon in the upper left corner and go to “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Content you see” &amp;gt; “Topics.”  At the bottom of the screen, there is a paragraph that suggests you check out “Your Twitter data.” Tap on that link and you’ll get access to these same topics.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to your favorite podcast promo codes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qq_DSri8Ve982G-WjH-a2Yo5yNc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268822/acastro_211213_4927_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Promo codes helped build an industry, now big brands are moving in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="56ikLh"&gt;Füm is the type of product that traditionally sells well through podcast ads. It’s a smoking cessation device, and when paired with a podcaster who uses it themselves, people buy. That’s why Adam McNeil, PR manager at the company, says he went from spending $3,000 per month on podcast ads at the beginning of this year to between $25,000 and $30,000 by the end. “It’s become our number one revenue source,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiJ4HT"&gt;McNeil is one of many direct response advertisers who’ve found a home in podcasting. You’re likely familiar with the others: Mailchimp, Casper, Manscaped, Tommy John, and any other that relies on promo codes. They’re synonymous with the industry. But in a year filled with indie shows going to big networks in eye-popping, multimillion-dollar deals, as well as a broader push from tech companies to make money off the space, these direct response advertisers say they’re getting priced or pushed out while the aspects they’ve come to know and love about the industry are disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YH40Y"&gt;McNeil, for example, says the cost to advertise doubled on one of his brand’s go-to shows after it was acquired — although so far, they’ve honored his prior price point. The appeal of advertising on the show has waned, however, because the hosts pack more advertisers into the same amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfUEIV"&gt;“If there’s only a few ads on the episode, it seems a little less intrusive to the listener, but all of a sudden, now there’s four, maybe five, on that episode,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxmX2C"&gt;Although the changes are often positioned as good for podcasters and the industry itself — more people are making money and attracting advertiser interest — this also comes with a compromise, the loss of the tight relationships between direct response brands and podcasters. The thing that helped make podcasting what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54iz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers say the experience of buying and distributing an ad is getting worse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q2gnt5"&gt;Another advertiser, who asked to remain anonymous over fears of straining their industry relationships, echoed McNeil. “We did have a show that we really loved working with,” they say. “It wasn’t small, but it was part of a smaller network, and everything about that felt like a true partnership. It did not feel like it was a transactional sale from a salesperson.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCK3ZX"&gt;The partnership was a “smash success” from the get-go, they say, with the team reaching their goals in half the time it typically takes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YRwhL"&gt;That all changed when that show got acquired. “I was just shocked by the difference,” they say. No longer could they switch out ad copy for a campaign that would run over three months. “If we’re not spending like half a million dollars, you don’t care if your listeners get sick of hearing our ads?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYZjb8"&gt;Plus, the show’s team previously guided them on how to create the best ad to talk to that specific audience, and the hands-on help no longer came with the amount the brand spent. Their embedded tracker wasn’t even configured correctly to determine how many people heard the ad. “It was like pulling teeth” to get everything in order to just run a successful podcast ad. The brand didn’t re-up their contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxnlHA"&gt;“I found that the larger companies are probably a lot more willing to just take your money and let you fail, or let it just happen,” McNeil adds. “The smaller networks are a lot more keen on trying to make sure that it’s a win for you, so that you renew the contract for four months, six months, a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3u1prj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ljRCTG"&gt;The issue is only becoming more pressing for both advertisers and show publishers. Acquisitions and licensing agreements occur regularly now, often with big price tags attached. This year, Amazon Music acquired &lt;em&gt;SmartLess&lt;/em&gt; in a deal reportedly worth as much as $80 million while Spotify is exclusively licensing &lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt; for a reported $60 million. Meanwhile, Vox Media, which owns &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, acquired Criminal Productions, capping off a year of acquisitions and partnerships that included Cafe Studios, &lt;em&gt;Longform&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gastropod&lt;/em&gt;. Also, SiriusXM acquired &lt;em&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/em&gt; from Roman Mars. Much of the impetus behind these deals is not only to buy reputable and far-reaching programs, but to also bulk up ad inventory. The publishers then, of course, are incentivized to make back the cash they spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ6NjT"&gt;One ad buyer, who also requested anonymity to speak freely about rates, says Spotify upped prices for its acquired and licensed shows. CPMs, or the cost per thousand listeners, on those programs are up three times as much, they say. A host-read ad that lived forever on Joe Rogan’s show used to cost tens of thousands of dollars previous to him going exclusive to Spotify. Next year, to get any ads on Rogan, the minimum spend is $1 million, they say, at a CPM upward of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi8YqD"&gt;To which Spotify spokeswoman Erin Styles says, “We believe the many innovations taking shape will benefit the entire marketplace, including creators and advertisers, and we’re confident that advertisers of all sizes will continue to find immense value in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D3NVTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An ad on Joe Rogan’s show, prior his Spotify deal, lived on an episode forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbSgqQ"&gt;Meanwhile, a separate podcaster who signed on with a big network says a buyout of their show now sells for five to 10 times more than they were charging on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQPGjb"&gt;“[Prior to all these acquisitions, advertisers] could be a mogul and be sitting on hundreds of personalities that could only advocate for [their] business, and it was performing, and it was building the brand,” says Dan Granger, founder and CEO of ad agency Oxford Road. “Then you start selling companies for $300 million with these really generous multiples, and all of a sudden, at some point, they’re going to have to show a return on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIwTTd"&gt;This leads to a world in which direct response advertisers not only lose access to the programming or treatment they once enjoyed but have to contend with bigger brands dominating the space because they can afford the more expensive ads. Magellan AI tracks the brands spending the most on podcast ads per month, and the top &lt;a href="https://www.magellan.ai/pages/top-15-podcast-advertisers-october-2021"&gt;10 list from October&lt;/a&gt; includes, yes, some brands one might expect, like HelloFresh and ZipRecruiter, but also Fortune 500 companies, like Capital One and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwOb0f"&gt;“The large brand advertisers that are advertising across television and radio and Pandora and Spotify are also looking for that type of scale that now podcasting, because it has grown so much, can provide,” says Greg Leader, SVP of advertising partnerships at SXM Media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVFPjN"&gt;These brand advertisers also often care more about putting their name into the world rather than literally selling a product, which changes the stakes of the marketing game. No more promo codes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5NbtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More brands have come to podcasting, including Fortune 500 companies with bigger budgets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9daLm"&gt;Alongside this broader change in the types of advertisers filtering into the space comes a push for, as Leader mentioned, scale, or the ability to reach lots of people quickly. To make their money back and maximize revenue, publishers are encouraging dynamic ad insertion, meaning ads aren’t baked into a program, as well as programmatic ads that aren’t inserted into specific shows necessarily but included based on audience targeting. The thing the direct response advertisers loved about the space — the baked-in, host-read ads that lived on forever as testimonials — are dissipating, at least at the space’s highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G523lY"&gt;McNeil, for example, says Füm advertises on a YouTube-distributed show and one episode reached a million views. It normally banks around 100,000. Füm paid for those 100,000 impressions, technically, but ended up with way more exposure because the ad lived on forever. “You lose that opportunity to go viral the moment you do dynamic ad insertion,” he says. Once the promised impressions are reached, an ad is swapped out for a different brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feQqWx"&gt;Which isn’t to say everyone feels for these advertisers. Maybe they had it too good, or maybe they purposely undervalued the podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9G8I5"&gt;“It’s the cycle of life,” Granger says. “You move to a cool, new neighborhood, and there’s an art gallery, and there’s some microbreweries, and there’s craftsmanship and products. Then there’s Starbucks, and then the place gets gentrified, and then everybody complains that it lost its edge. And then one day, there’s Walmart. And like, yeah, this is life. It doesn’t mean that you can’t get what you need, but if you think the street is going to be all noncorporate independent? No, the big money’s going to come, and they’re going to occupy the most real estate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="rc1kMD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drgNR5"&gt;Others think this situation is good news for podcasting as a growing, more profitable space. “I think of our industry kind of like an island being fueled by the volcano that’s underneath, adding more magma each year,” says John Goforth, CRO of Magellan AI. “The square footage is getting bigger and bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AEcQw"&gt;Multiple people I spoke with suggest the industry is merely stratifying — the top shows are going exclusive in million-plus-dollar deals, cutting off access to the protein shake makers of the world while smaller, newer podcasters stream in, hoping for the protein shake makers to buy an ad. The direct response advertisers, they say, should look in new places and for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyRmOh"&gt;“There’s always going to be somebody coming up in the world before they get picked off by Spotify,” Granger says. “And [the advertisers are] just going to have to surf on those, they’re going to have to keep riding those waves, but it’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FC0w9Z"&gt;The question is whether the advertisers who helped build are willing and able to find a place on these newer shows, or if the podcasting industry’s onward march means leaving the mattress sellers behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV warns subscribers it could lose Disney’s channels later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOVVwiqNzAvhFhq51X2-sXYFOic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268622/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyMCeF"&gt;Google has warned that YouTube TV could lose access to over a dozen Disney-owned channels later this week if it’s unable to renew its agreement with the company. In a &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV says its current deal with Disney is due to expire this Friday, December 17th, after which the channels could disappear if it’s unable to reach a new agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXJErM"&gt;“Our ask of Disney, as with all of our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider – by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them,” YouTube’s blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA6lGF"&gt;Here’s the list of impacted channels. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-channels-pulled-youtube-tv-1235061987/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that eight ABC local stations could also disappear from YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THHcx7"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n7zA2I"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pOgMmH"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UONIYH"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cFXKPu"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfvV2X"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33a4HL"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPwucW"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FRDRm2"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XS2dPN"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wBVBxJ"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E64O4W"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="afjA3W"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWZSf0"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GQmtnz"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlXfrR"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5jlW6"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jbI7jn"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Disney said that it’s “committed to working with Google to reach a fair, market-based agreement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYbHEv"&gt;“We are optimistic that we can reach a deal and continue to provide their YouTube TV customers with our live sporting events and news coverage plus kids, family and general entertainment programming,” Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2aXU8O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always want to be transparent and give you a heads-up during these active conversations. Disney is an important partner, and we’re optimistic that we can work with Disney and keep their content available on YouTube TV. For live updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5"&gt;https://t.co/R7MzaOv0p5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube TV (@YouTubeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1470533371046416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBOTnY"&gt;If a deal can’t be reached by December 17th, YouTube TV says it will decrease its prices by $15 per month while Disney’s channels are off its service. It says that customers are free to pause or cancel their memberships at any time, and points them towards Disney’s $13.99 per month streaming bundle if they want to maintain access to “some” of Disney’s content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5mMJ1"&gt;This is just the latest high profile carriage dispute YouTube TV has been involved in this year. These have affected both the company’s deals to offer streaming content from other companies, as well as its agreements with hardware providers to host YouTube’s apps. Less than three months ago the service was just days away from losing access to NBCUniversal’s channels before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;reaching an agreement in early October&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this month it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;reached an agreement with Roku&lt;/a&gt; for it to continue carrying YouTube’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Algorithms that detect cancer can be fooled by hacked images</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPSxTf8AYgc-qpzKofU6Hg-4h2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268556/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMCKpD"&gt;Artificial intelligence programs that check medical images for evidence of cancer can be duped by hacks and cyberattacks, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27577-x"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers demonstrated that a computer program could add or remove evidence of cancer from mammograms, and  those changes fooled both an AI tool and human radiologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6YA3q"&gt;That could lead to an incorrect diagnosis. An AI program helping to screen mammograms might say a scan is healthy when there are actually signs of cancer or incorrectly say that a patient does have cancer when they’re actually cancer free. Such hacks are not known to have happened in the real world yet, but the new study adds to a growing body of research suggesting healthcare organizations need to be prepared for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRgHcA"&gt;Hackers are increasingly targeting hospitals and healthcare institutions with cyberattacks. Most of the time, those attacks siphon off patient data (which is valuable on the black market) or lock up an organization’s computer systems until that organizations pays a ransom. Both of those types of attacks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;can harm patients&lt;/a&gt; by gumming up the operations at a hospital and making it harder for healthcare workers to deliver good care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPJaGV"&gt;But experts are also growing more worried about the potential for more direct attacks on people’s health. Security researchers have shown that hackers can remotely &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;break into internet-connected insulin pumps&lt;/a&gt; and deliver dangerous doses of the medication, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvqNnf"&gt;Hacks that can change medical images and impact a diagnosis also fall into that category. In the new study on mammograms, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a research team from the University of Pittsburgh designed a computer program that would make the X-ray scans of breasts that originally appeared to have no signs of cancer look like they were cancerous, and that would make mammograms that look cancerous appear to have no signs of cancer. They then fed the tampered images to an artificial intelligence program trained to spot signs of breast cancer and asked five human radiologists to decide if the images were real or fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGofOt"&gt;Around 70 percent of the manipulated images fooled that program — that is, the AI wrongly said that images manipulated to look cancer-free were cancer-free, and that the images manipulated to look like they had cancer did have evidence of cancer. As for the radiologists, some were better at spotting manipulated images than others. Their accuracy at picking out the fake images ranged widely, from 29 percent to 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSnuGZ"&gt;Other studies have also demonstrated the possibility that a cyberattack on medical images could lead to incorrect diagnoses. In 2019, a team of cybersecurity researchers &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-mirsky_0.pdf"&gt;showed that hackers&lt;/a&gt; could add or remove evidence of lung cancer from CT scans. Those changes also fooled both human radiologists and artificial intelligence programs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0tK4q"&gt;There &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164850/"&gt;haven’t been&lt;/a&gt; public or high-profile cases where a hack like this has happened. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-mirsky_0.pdf"&gt;a few reasons&lt;/a&gt; a hacker might want to manipulate things like mammograms or lung cancer scans. A hacker might be interested in targeting a specific patient, like a political figure, or they might want to alter their own scans to get money from their insurance company or sign up for disability payments. Hackers might also manipulate images randomly and refuse to stop tampering with them until a hospital pays a ransom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WURnlj"&gt;Whatever the reason, demonstrations like this one show that healthcare organizations and people designing AI models should be aware that hacks that alter medical scans are a possibility. Models should be shown manipulated images during their training to teach them to spot fake ones, study author Shandong Wu, associate professor of radiology, biomedical informatics, and bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a statement. Radiologists might also need to be trained to identify fake images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO965V"&gt;“We hope that this research gets people thinking about medical AI model safety and what we can do to defend against potential attacks,” Wu said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deplatforming Trump didn’t work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump Holds Rally At Iowa State Fairgrounds" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vu9rG39WkY1g3o7Q9D7Rseneb5M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268459/1345757982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ex-president is as powerful as ever, and democratic erosion is accelerating&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="DzO8wC"&gt;Today, as the year winds down, let’s talk about what we learned in 2021 about the relationship between tech and democracy — and about where the most urgent questions lie as we head into 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4PLgo"&gt;In the years that Donald Trump served as president, platforms faced frequent calls to remove his accounts. From his primary posting station on Twitter, Trump had among other things spread lies about COVID, incited harassment against average citizens, and threatened nuclear war. After losing re-election to Joe Biden, he lied relentlessly about the outcome, undermining faith in democracy and ultimately inciting the January 6th attacks on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZrdAi"&gt;Because he was president, he was allowed to keep his accounts through January 6th. But after Congress certified Biden’s victory — and Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on his behalf — platforms suspended his accounts indefinitely. To tech determinists, who believe that social networks uniquely enabled Trump’s rise and were among the primary sources of his power, the past 11 months offered us an imperfect test of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFAmHu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;his power has arguably only increased&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOhNvO"&gt;If you believe social networks were a primary source of Trump’s power, it follows that removing him from those networks would lessen that power. And yet in nearly a year since Trump was removed from those networks, his power has arguably only increased. After&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/trump-deplatforms-himself"&gt; an aborted effort to start a blog this summer&lt;/a&gt;, he has settled into a routine of sending out tweet-like press releases to supporters and press outlets, many of which still find their way into the Twitter timeline and the news cycle. He makes frequent cable TV appearances, and recently held a rally in Iowa. A SPAC deal, which has promised to create some sort of Trump-centric media company and social network, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-13/the-trump-spac-pipe-is-free-money?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;is also now underway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t75VQd"&gt;More importantly than all that, though, Trump has served as promoter-in-chief for a national campaign to rewrite election laws in his favor, while installing supporters in key positions that could enable him to successfully overturn an election loss in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLr8vC"&gt;Removing Trump from Twitter and other platforms surely spared us a year’s worth of lies and incitements to violence; it was and remains the right thing to do. But in a larger sense, it’s clear that deplatforming Trump did little to improve the underlying political situation in this country. It seems that situation is getting worse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt3kEV"&gt;In a truly chilling cover story for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/"&gt;Barton Gellman describes January 6th as a rehearsal for what is to come.&lt;/a&gt; (If you abandon today’s edition now and just go read that story in its entirety instead, it won’t hurt my feelings.) Two themes from the piece stand out: one, the way Trump critics are being systematically purged within the Republican party, leaving only the feeblest resistance behind; and two, how small a role tech in general or social networks specifically seem to play in any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANll81"&gt;To be sure, there are hints of it in the story: a Facebook live stream here, a Telegram message there. A retired firefighter who believes the 2020 election was stolen, or says he does, serves as a proxy in the story for Trump’s base — and the firefighter gets most of his misinformation from the right-wing media ecosystem, which has thrived on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PHFhts"&gt;&lt;q&gt;21 million Americans could plausibly be described as “committed insurrectionists.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdfnI2"&gt;But this is not a story about algorithms polarizing us via engagement-based ranking, or about demagogues recruiting followers via the suggested user list. Instead, to Gellman at least, it’s about something much older, and uglier: that reliable predictor of genocide, fears of a “Great Replacement.” As changing demographics predict a white minority in the United States by 2045, many white Republicans are desperate to cement their power — using violence if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPtJq1"&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; story, a group called the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, or CPOST, ran national opinion surveys to gauge the attitudes of people who say they do not trust the 2020 election results. They found that perhaps 21 million Americans could plausibly be described as “committed insurrectionists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgcKru"&gt;Drawing connections to Slobodan Milošević’s Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and Northern Ireland in the 1960s, Gellman writes of Americans today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3XD99o"&gt;The committed insurrectionists, Pape judged, were genuinely dangerous. There were not many militia members among them, but more than one in four said the country needed groups like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. One-third of them owned guns, and 15 percent had served in the military. All had easy access to the organizing power of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29k0od"&gt;What Pape was seeing in these results did not fit the government model of lone wolves and small groups of extremists. “This really is a new, politically violent mass movement,” he told me. “This is collective political violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rdMWtL"&gt;As recently as 2017, it still seemed at least possible that we might buttress some elements of our democracy at the level of the social network: that if we caught and removed Russian agents, stopped recommending extremist organizations, and eliminated all the misinformation and disinformation we could find, a kind of balance might be restored. Four years on, it’s now clear that while those steps were necessary, they were not sufficient, and the country is moving inexorably toward a constitutional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP1vf3"&gt;It’s also clear that the determinist case for tech reform was mostly wishful thinking. On one hand, platforms have regularly been found to be complicit in spreading hate speech that leads to real-world violence, most famously in Myanmar and India. And even in the United States, where platforms devote an outsized percentage of their moderation resources, a violent movement like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/20/21375381/facebook-qanon-purge-content-policy-tide-pods"&gt;QAnon was allowed to flower for years&lt;/a&gt; before they finally cracked down in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XTyln"&gt;But reading Gellman’s story, or what is effectively a companion piece in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/interactive/2021/january-6-next-coup-signs/"&gt;the next 18 steps to look for in our coming democratic erosion&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes clear how much bigger our emergency is than all of that. The platforms have their role to play, but it’s smaller than I had assumed. Which is unfortunate, because the past five years have shown that tech companies &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be cajoled into addressing at least some of the harms that take place on their watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRh94T"&gt;Which is more than I can say for Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peCZrT"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; over the weekend, Cecelia Kang examined the fruits of American lawmakers’ five-year-old reckoning over the size, power, and influence of our biggest companies. She finds a slew of hearings, a pack of confused congressmen and viral gaffes, and a blank space where their long-promised tech reforms should be. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/11/business/congress-tech-regulation.html"&gt;Kang writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X6Wcre"&gt;The lack of regulation of technology companies is not because elected officials don’t understand the internet. That used to be the case, and it helps explain why they have been so slow with oversight measures. Now, though, new questions about technology get mapped onto increasingly intractable political divides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idfcjf"&gt;Without the distractions of bizarre questions, what’s left is the naked reality that the parties are deeply at odds over how to protect consumers and encourage businesses. Dozens of bills to strengthen privacy, encourage competition and quell misinformation have stalled because of a basic disagreement over the hand of government on businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nhP5y2"&gt;This is profoundly true. And yet, in the context of democratic erosion, it can also feel so quaint as to be essentially beside the point. One of America’s two major political parties is undertaking a concerted effort to eliminate the role of voters in choosing their elected officials. And we’re surprised that these two sides can’t agree on how to govern &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZOIP0"&gt;It’s a shame, of course, because there is so much regulation to be done. There are even, here and there, good ideas: I love &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-want-social-media-apps-to-share-research-11639044001?st=6517ctjjj2y6ab2&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"&gt;this new bill&lt;/a&gt; from Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE), Rob Portman (R-OH) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), which would require platforms like Facebook to share data with independent researchers. Other worthy bills would require disclosures around content moderation and political advertising, or restrain anticompetitive business practices. All of these reforms could be enacted without infringing on companies’ speech rights, the tripwire that has doomed so many efforts to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to2qWK"&gt;But as this year comes to a close, I find it necessary to restore some sense of proportion to the subjects that we cover around here. The present and future state of platforms will always be the core subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platformer"&gt;Platformer&lt;/a&gt;. But so many assumptions about that future rely on the notion that those platforms will be built inside a stable democracy, and within a few years that may well not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY76E6"&gt;Americans did their part: the majority voted to preserve their democracy, and gave to Democrats the presidency and both houses of Congress. But the margins are narrow, our governance system is old and brittle, and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrA3eO"&gt;All of this has been said before, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/democrats-senate-reconciliation.html"&gt;often much better&lt;/a&gt;, by people who make politics their full-time beat. I would love nothing more than to join the rest of Silicon Valley in full-time contemplation of Web3, the metaverse, and anything else that might distract me from the potential of life under permanent minority rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrEDG"&gt;But the future of tech and the future of democracy are inextricably linked. Biden’s victory last year offered some hope that Congress would be able to make progress on both subjects. As we approach next year’s midterm elections, though, there is distressingly little progress to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5vcztd"&gt;For five years now we have listened to lawmakers lecture the tech industry about its many failures. But effective platform governance will only ever take us so far. And if it can’t protect our democracy at this crucial moment, starting &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/crucial-boost-john-lewis-voting-rights-advancement-act"&gt;by passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act&lt;/a&gt;, the most catastrophic failure of all will be that of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google staffs up to build OS for unknown ‘innovative AR device’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXC5mLERh75gLOd8LErMkrGu2Do=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268422/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9frQMG"&gt;Google is hiring an “Augmented Reality OS” team focused on building software for an “innovative AR device,” according to job listings &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/13/google-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team is led by Mark Lucovsky, who announced he’d &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921"&gt;joined the company this week&lt;/a&gt;. Lucovsky previously worked at Meta developing an in-house alternative to Android to power the company’s hardware, and also co-authored the Windows NT operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvN979"&gt;According to Google’s job listings, the Augmented Reality OS team is building “the software components that control and manage the hardware on [its] Augmented Reality (AR) products.” This is far from Google’s first stab at developing AR software, and follows the company’s work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219696/google-arcore-augmented-reality-platform-announce-release-pixel-samsung"&gt;ARCore for Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11895368/google-project-tango-name-change-ar-atap"&gt;Tango&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s Google Glass, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGlass%20Enterprise%20Edition,developing%20for%20Glass.%E2%80%9D"&gt;aimed at the business and enterprise market&lt;/a&gt;, is currently built on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0REbMj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I became a Noogler. My role is to lead the Operating System team for Augmented Reality at Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in joining me on this journey, I'd love to talk. Here is a link to one of the many positions I'm working to fill: &lt;a href="https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD"&gt;https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hVAVKcZvQJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hVAVKcZvQJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— mark lucovsky (@marklucovsky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GevAyQ"&gt;“We’re focused on making immersive computing accessible to many people through mobile devices,” reads &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/98805776622985926-senior-software-engineer-embedded-systems-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;one job listing&lt;/a&gt; for a senior software engineer on the team, adding that they’ll be responsible for helping “create compelling AR experiences on highly-customized hardware platforms.” There are other listings for developers focused on camera and input hardware, and some that mention “real-time operating system (RTOS) development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93CXph"&gt;While most of the positions are based in the US, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that some are based in Waterloo, Canada. It’s here that North, the augmented reality company behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18223593/focals-smart-glasses-north-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Focals smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;Google acquired last year&lt;/a&gt;, is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq17fc"&gt;Between that acquisition and these open job positions, it looks like Google is increasingly serious about developing and releasing more AR hardware. The renewed interest can’t come soon enough, with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rumored to be releasing a mixed-reality headset&lt;/a&gt; of its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;as early as next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma7cgx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAY9QK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Air Glass ‘assisted reality’ device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUTMMFUjNxNB3mfUvNkzsXAGqaY=/47x0:1874x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268392/3._OPPO_Air_Glass_Weather_Notification.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2OECP5"&gt;Oppo has announced the Air Glass, an AR device that’ll go on sale early next year. Oppo describes the Air Glass as an “assisted reality” product, as opposed to augmented reality, meaning it projects 2D information into your field of view rather than overlaying 3D objects onto the real world. (Yes, sort of like Google Glass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZB2rG"&gt;The Air Glass has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor and weighs just 30g (about 1oz) in total. Oppo says it should last for 3 hours of active usage and 40 hours on standby. There are two frame designs, a silver half-frame and a black full-frame, and each is available in two sizes. The inside of the frame has a magnetic port that allows it to be attached to more conventional glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzzcU6"&gt;The waveguide display uses a tiny projector with Micro LED tech capable of up to 3 million nits peak brightness, though Oppo says the actual brightness will be up to 1,400 nits in average conditions. It can be operated via touch, voice, hand tracking, and head tracking, as well as through a Smart Glass app on a smartphone running Oppo’s ColorOS 11 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lC-mTEjw8u4q7kiM-3yEWhgA6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086596/4._OPPO_Air_Glass_Teleprompter.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQK7P"&gt;Oppo’s proposed use cases for the Air Glass are relatively modest. The company says it can be used for notifications and directions, as you’d expect, as well as features like teleprompting and real-time translation. The display is monochrome with either 16 or 256 levels of grayscale depending on the mode, so the Air Glass isn’t going to be beaming rich content into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nrgz"&gt;That said, it probably isn’t going to be a mature, mainstream product, either. Oppo says the Air Glass will receive a “limited release” in Q1 2022, and at least at first it’ll be only sold in mainland China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkNTm1"&gt;The Air Glass was announced as part of Oppo’s ongoing annual Inno Day event. Oppo also revealed its first in-house NPU chip to boost machine learning-related imaging performance; it’s called the MariSilicon X and will feature in Oppo’s next Find X flagship in the first quarter of next year. Last week Oppo confirmed the debut of its first folding phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;the Find N&lt;/a&gt;, though that hasn’t broken cover just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
