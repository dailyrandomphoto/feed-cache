    <title>Nvidia leak may reveal unannounced games, including God of War for PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5woCgSlCXpCPjkVhuoDcR4z805E=/0x0:1371x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69853409/GameofWar.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HfheJ"&gt;If you made an Nvidia GeForce Now server spit out a confidential list of thousands of games, some never-before-seen, would you think they were legit? Fake? Somewhere in between? That’s not a rhetorical question, because developer Ighor July has published &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/xPaw/6a42aafd3c9d19b3ceab2e90b5a37cd2"&gt;that very list to GitHub&lt;/a&gt; — including games like the PlayStation exclusive &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; seemingly coming to Windows PC via Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsROXh"&gt;Here’s a screenshot of what that looks like in the GeForce Now client, &lt;a href="https://ighor.medium.com/i-unlocked-nvidia-geforce-now-and-stumbled-upon-pirates-dc48a3f8ff7"&gt;according to the developer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2dJ9UjqO_XWtMkG34vwts4shLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22847842/god_of_war_gfn.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kQ7Hc"&gt;There are reasons to believe the list is legit. We know graphics giant Nvidia has access to games long before they’re released — and we know Sony in particularly has been banking on &lt;em&gt;banking&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation games on PC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455810/sony-ps5-profitable-uncharted-4-pc-investor-presentation"&gt;It quietly revealed &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/em&gt; was coming to PC&lt;/a&gt;, after seeing a 250 percent return on its investment porting &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; to the platform, and it was just Thursday that Sony announced it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;part of the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a name that we’d never heard of before then, but already appears in Nvidia’s list as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNcnL1"&gt;So too do &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444039/ps5-playstation-5-final-fantasy-xvi-demons-souls-pc-announcement"&gt;the games where Sony had to retroactively retract all mentions of PC&lt;/a&gt; to make them sound like PlayStation exclusives. PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;appears as well, as does a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1N9xu"&gt;And there are codenames for games in here that seem original, ones that bring up zero search results. Is “Platinum” the internal name for Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; games? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GBFper"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reasons to believe, reasons to disbelieve&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yp1svl"&gt;But there are also a lot of mentions that seem rather out of date or out of place, like a whole host of Facebook-exclusive Oculus Rift titles that would make little sense on Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, or a mention of a “&lt;em&gt;Titanfall 3&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which clarifies that it’s actually “GAMEapex_legends_-_titanfall,” aka &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, the popular battle royale game. And some of them may simply be guesses, like &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts IV&lt;/em&gt;, “BioShock 2022,” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64ZQL0"&gt;All of that means you should probably take any given name on the list with a grain of salt — maybe don’t get your hopes up for remasters of &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Tactics Ogre&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2 &lt;/em&gt;quite yet, even if all of those appear in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23Vfo2"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;God of War &lt;/em&gt;for PC does seem more solid than others. It’s one of a handful of titles that specifically mentions Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmwl2T"&gt;You can peruse &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/xPaw/6a42aafd3c9d19b3ceab2e90b5a37cd2"&gt;the full list for yourself right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq0TD3"&gt;Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon gives the Kindle’s interface a refresh</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cj8gN-5mXTRXQh0xEsOsOcu5ueM=/0x61:1768x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69853091/Header_Jaeger_Decanter_3008x1300.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjD9Up"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23599449011"&gt;Amazon has announced&lt;/a&gt; that most recent Kindles will be getting a new simpler UI through a software update (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/a-quick-tour-of-amazons-new-ui-for-kindle-e-readers/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update mainly focuses on navigation, adding a bar to the bottom of the screen that lets you jump between the Home screen, the book you’re currently reading, and the Library screen. Some &lt;a href="https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2021/08/17/new-kindle-software-update-5-13-7-brings-user-interface-changes/"&gt;have had the update for a few weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon has announced that the update will be rolling out widely over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5NtQz"&gt;The way you access the Kindle’s quick settings (which let you turn on airplane mode, adjust brightness, and more) has also changed. You now get access to the menu by swiping down from the top of the screen, instead of tapping a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wap7jD"&gt;Amazon says more changes will be coming later this year, with an update that will let you see more recently read books on the Home screen and will refresh the Library’s collection view and filter and sort menus. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EmtiiOZQ0df6u7COCFk-H_LM4E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22847407/Pack_2_UPDATED_Jaeger_Decanter_Group_1000x1000._CB642431930_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A preview of the Home and Library screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9OxZhr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23599449011"&gt;Amazon’s webpage&lt;/a&gt; for the redesign says the feature will be rolling out to supported devices (8th Gen Kindle, 7th Gen Paperwhite, and Oasis or above) within the next few weeks. Basically, it includes most Kindles released since 2015, so there’s a decent chance yours will be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4qhO5"&gt;Unfortunately, Amazon hasn’t made the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GK33S847NN4V6Y83&amp;amp;ref_=hp_lp_help_c_Identify-Your-Kindle-E-Reader"&gt;Kindles’ generation info&lt;/a&gt; easily available until the update that’s currently rolling out. It seems &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-generation-of-kindle-do-i-have"&gt;the best way to find out&lt;/a&gt; if your device is eligible is to Google the model number, which should be on the back of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHjtwQ"&gt;Like the readers’ E Ink displays, the Kindle interface doesn’t get refreshed very often. Amazon didn’t add the ability to make the lock screen show the cover of the book you’re reading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387146/amazon-display-cover-lockscreen-current-book-image"&gt;until earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the Kindle web browser’s “experimental” label — which has existed for at least 10 years, &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/why-do-you-need-to-disable-javascript-on-the-kindle-browser"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GoodEReader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is gone. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; reports not being able to see any changes from the previous (and &lt;a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00007T46Ek/experimental-browser-on-my-kindle-doesnt-work"&gt;not very good&lt;/a&gt;) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1r9e3"&gt;The update should automatically install on your Kindle at some point if it’s connected to Wi-Fi, but you can also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFAE5G5UGCYA25DW"&gt;manually update your device using a computer&lt;/a&gt; if you’re looking to get the new UI as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP ZBook Studio G8 review: works hard, plays harder</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Well-designed, but far too expensive for most people&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wRKy1r"&gt;There’s usually a clear line that divides any manufacturer’s lineup of gaming and business laptops, but the new ZBook Studio G8 blurs HP’s lines a bit. It aims to be multiple machines at once, including a gaming laptop. And for the most part, it pulls the juggling act off, if you can stomach the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKG5dM"&gt;The G8 looks like a high-end Windows machine, and it’s easy to see where it fits in HP’s catalog next to the dashing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Spectre X360&lt;/a&gt;. This one borrows the glossy trim going around all of its edges, and its blend of aluminum and magnesium build materials looks and feels great. It has a generously sized Windows Precision trackpad, and its keyboard is just as delightful to type on as some of HP’s other recent models we’ve reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDicJl"&gt;It’s a simple but gorgeous laptop, yet I wouldn’t recommend &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345620019820%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22671603%2Fhp-zbook-studio-g8-laptop-business-gaming-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this $4,727 configuration of HP’s ZBook Studio G8&lt;/a&gt; to most people. The price is overkill if all that you want to do is game, and most people likely won’t need the robust suite of privacy and security features (like an Absolute persistence module, TPM 2.0, Bitlocker encryption, HP Power On Authentication, and much more) that are included to accommodate the enterprise crowd. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;some very good laptops out there suited for creators or gamers&lt;/a&gt; that we recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgkXkT"&gt;But as an all-in-one entertainment, gaming, and enterprise device (a unique combination, to be sure), the ZBook Studio G8 is a polished, performant effort that delivers powerful specs and many features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3atDdm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10750363"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JRpyUN"&gt;HP’s ZBook Studio G8 is a versatile laptop, but it invites comparisons to other gaming laptops in a few major ways, the most noticeable one being its backlit RGB keyboard with custom per-key backlighting. This is HP’s only business laptop to feature one, and it even has the company’s Omen Gaming Hub in the taskbar by default, where you can adjust the keyboard backlight settings and optimize performance for any games you have installed. You might get some strange looks if you work at a buttoned-up office, but it’s also likely that it’ll just make your ThinkPad-toting colleagues jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VAi0EI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10750299"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UH6HjP"&gt;My review sample has Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3070 graphics chip (85W maximum graphics power, 1230MHz boost clock), along with other powerful specs including the &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/213798/intel-core-i911950h-processor-24m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html"&gt;Intel Core i9-11950H vPro processor&lt;/a&gt;, 32GB of fast 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM (soldered on, unfortunately), and a 2TB NVMe SSD (replaceable, but unfortunately just one M.2 slot). Other configurations utilize the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fdesign-visualization%2Frtx-a5000%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22671603%2Fhp-zbook-studio-g8-laptop-business-gaming-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX A-series graphics chips&lt;/a&gt; and are geared toward full-time creators, engineers, and for others with intensive tasks. But this one was made to be both your workstation and gaming rig. So, of course, I got my game on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSOgBZ"&gt;Gaming is a joyous thing to do with the ZBook Studio G8, especially with this configuration that has a 15.6-inch 4K OLED touchscreen that’s covered in Gorilla Glass 6. It looks so brilliant that I almost didn’t mind it topping out at a 60Hz refresh rate. Enthusiast gamers who crave seeing their games playing at 100+ frames per second won’t get that here, at least without plugging an external monitor in. There’s an HDMI 2.1 port, so you can output to 4K at fast refresh rates, if you have a compatible monitor and if you play games that can run well on this laptop. For those who really want fast-moving graphics on the laptop’s screen, HP makes a non-OLED screen option that can go up to 4K IPS instead of OLED at a 120Hz refresh rate, but it naturally won’t look as luscious even if it’s running at a faster clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYSQ9TVKqI0njI2odPoZNfTEtQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810071/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The colors and contrast on this configuration’s 4K OLED screen look incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mu3ux23v6smDT7goWoPLpbo6fjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810068/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsurprisingly, the viewing angles are great, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U1j7GB"&gt;As is always the case, performance will vary depending on what games you like to play, but gaming at native 4K resolution in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; yielded good results, running at around 45 frames per second on the highest graphical settings. Making a few tweaks to the shadow quality and to the anti-aliasing pushed it up to a steady 60 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; presents more of a challenge for laptops, and the ZBook Studio G8 managed an average of 37 frames per second at 4K resolution with ultra graphical settings turned on. Not bad, and switching on the Nvidia DLSS feature boosted it to a more playable 47 frames per second at 4K resolution. Just a few tweaks later, it felt great to be running this demanding game on a workstation at near 60 frames per second. The G8 isn’t as loud during peak performance as some gaming laptops, but with some games the metal section above the keyboard becomes almost too hot to touch. I didn’t notice any throttling in performance during gaming or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XtpIu"&gt;The capable specs in this ZBook Studio G8 let it fly through my everyday work tasks, which usually involve having over a dozen Microsoft Edge tabs open at once, with Slack and Spotify running in the background. Occasionally, I’ll open Affinity Photo to crop photos, too. Most laptops with a good amount of RAM don’t struggle being put through these paces, so I ran a 4K export test in Adobe Premiere Pro to give it more of a workout. It didn’t break much of a sweat here either, sprinting to complete the export of a five-minute, 33-second video in four minutes, 14 seconds. It’s worth keeping in mind that Premiere Pro can work in mysterious ways sometimes, with better specs not necessarily leading to faster export times. We’ve seen some less pricey laptops perform just as well in this test as the ZBook Studio G8, if not better, though this is a good result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxskvk1bEjuKMG66FXJjLP83Qng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810072/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers are better than I expected, but not the best on a laptop that I’ve ever heard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ld6tM9L-UjlOA0qXSj5kUCD5rh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810067/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I adore the key layout and performance of the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAydIM"&gt;Outside of performance, I’m happy with most of the design choices that HP made for the ZBook Studio G8. Its keyboard is great, both in layout and the key feel, requiring very little time and few errors for me to adjust. The same goes for its trackpad, which I mentioned before has Windows Precision drivers and is responsive, with a satisfying, tactile click. As for my wishlist for the next iteration, I wish the trackpad’s entire surface was easy to click, like Apple’s MacBook trackpad. The bottom of the trackpad here offers an effortless click, while it gets a little tougher about two-thirds of the way up toward its top. Also, the ZBook’s OLED screen is a treat to look at, but I hope HP employs a taller 3:2 aspect ratio here next time, like it does with the Spectre X360 lineup. Lastly, there are a dearth of ports for a laptop of this size, and for one made to wear so many hats. It has just one USB-A port in total, along with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI 2.1, a Mini DisplayPort jack, a headphone jack, and a proprietary plug for its 200W power brick (some models use a 150W brick). The brick itself is compact, with a braided cable going to the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0K94j"&gt;There’s a Windows Hello-ready webcam and a fingerprint scanner for signing in securely, though using either one is optional. The quality of the 720p IR webcam isn’t stellar, but it gets the job done. (If you care about video quality, though, maybe you’ll find something better in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera"&gt;our USB webcam buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.) The speakers are better than I expected for taking video calls with, or for listening to music, though you’ll get better performance out of just about any set of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-zOlh_n-9H3-ansyxYXu7YGCrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810073/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a laptop this expensive, there aren’t nearly enough ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOKgrhFkPbxzUV1qdI_WjuzCHVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810076/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though, it does hit the major beats with Thunderbolt 4, Mini DisplayPort, and an SD card reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mGkGy"&gt;This version of the ZBook Studio G8 comes with some other welcome extras. It’s one of a few HP models to ship with Tile functionality and it has the app pre-installed. You’ll be able to track its location via the Tile mobile app, so long as it still has battery life. If photography or shooting videos is a profession or a hobby, you’ll get good use out of this laptop’s full-sized SD card slot. It supports up to 985MB/s transfer speeds with the SD 7.0 spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DawY8k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10750295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o7gnck"&gt;Battery life in gaming laptops has increasingly become less of a joke and, at times, is actually impressive. The longevity of the ZBook Studio G8 can’t hang with laptops that have AMD’s latest Ryzen processors, but I wasn’t too let down by its roughly five-hour battery life. Powering through roughly a half day of work isn’t bad, considering this model is a 4K display, but that won’t cut it for some people who want a laptop that can survive all day. HP says that this laptop’s Thunderbolt 4 ports can be used to charge it, but they can’t pull enough power to both run the machine and charge simultaneously. Though, it could charge the battery while it’s sleeping or off, albeit slower than the stock charger can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_k_b3oVPIX2hX7aG7k5QiYwfMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810074/cfaulkner_210824_4727_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZBook Studio G8 looks fantastic for a laptop that’s technically a workstation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAVsmM"&gt;The HP ZBook Studio G8 is the best enterprise laptop trying to be a gaming laptop, which I recognize is an accolade that doesn’t carry a lot of weight, since it’s really just HP in this niche space. Though, I think if HP iterated on this design and made it a more gaming-focused laptop on the software side, it would have serious potential to take on other chic-looking laptops with real gaming chops, like Razer’s Blade 15 or the MSI GS66 Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SDfbkF"&gt;But for now, I suspect there aren’t many people who’ve been holding onto their cash, waiting for this exact kind of laptop to arrive. If you’re a serious gamer who’s looking for something reliable and great, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;you should get Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15 that costs nearly $1,000 less&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have a 4K OLED, but its specs are more balanced for performance and cost efficiency. More games will run more smoothly with its screen’s lower WQHD resolution, and faster, too, with its 165Hz refresh rate. The ZBook Studio G8 is too costly to recommend, but I’m nevertheless excited about the future of this lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A doctor’s quest for more organ emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Emoji for the anatomical heart on the left and the lungs on the right, on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIwye7bLxS6jjsbBrRvxY3nmbNU=/54x0:881x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852736/ios_anatomical_heart_lungs_new_emoji_2020.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The anatomical heart and lungs emoji, as seen on iOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple/&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/first-look-new-emojis-coming-to-ios-in-2020/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UtMekI"&gt;The medical world needs more emoji, according to Shuhan He, an emergency medicine physician who &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/04/metro/this-mass-general-doctor-helped-get-two-new-medical-emojis-approved/"&gt;helped propose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the anatomical heart and lungs emoji. Now,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He and others have laid out the case for an even larger variety of health-related emoji, which they argue could improve communication between doctors and patients.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atsvvA"&gt;In recent years, emoji related to medicine and health — like stethoscopes, hearing aids, bones, and microbes — have made their way into the Unicode Standard. In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783847"&gt;commentary published&lt;/a&gt; last week in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, He and his co-authors hope Unicode will approve more emoji that could be used in medical contexts, including emoji for more organs, like the stomach, liver, and intestines, and equipment like an IV bag, CT scan, and pill pack. He also wants more medical professionals to push for such emoji and to establish a standard for emoji usage in medical communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XhIlr"&gt;“We know in medicine that when patients say specific words, that they tend to highly correlate with specific pathology,” says He. People often describe crushing chest pain, for example, as feeling like an elephant is sitting on their chest. “We also consistently always ask people, what is your&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pain like: sharp, stabbing, dull, or fiery? Those are all emoji that can be represented in pictorial form rather than verbal communication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D1fDju"&gt;&lt;q&gt;elephant emoji, heart emoji&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1hqa"&gt;Emoji-like images are already widely used in medical settings, He says. The Wong-Baker pain scale shows a smiley face at one end and a grimacing or crying face at the other to signify pain levels. That scale was initially developed for children but is now used in many doctors’ offices and hospitals for patients of all ages. If smiley faces are already a part of medical communication, why not also leverage the visual language that’s standardized across people’s phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilRzFJ"&gt;He sees a range of uses for emoji in medicine. Patients who can’t speak or don’t know English could use emoji to describe their symptoms. For patients who do speak English but don’t have much health literacy, a common, standardized visual language could make it easier for them to understand and follow treatment instructions. The rise of telehealth also provides more opportunities for medical staff to supplement their communications with visuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMfw4g"&gt;Jennifer 8. Lee, one of He’s co-authors, is a co-founder of &lt;a href="http://www.emojination.org"&gt;Emojination&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that advocates for more inclusive and representative emoji. Emojination has helped proposals for a number of emoji make it through Unicode’s submission process, including medical emoji like the stethoscope, blood drop, X-ray, and adhesive bandage. (The fight for the blood drop emoji, initially proposed as a menstruation symbol, is included in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18514833/picture-character-emoji-documentary-movie-unicode-tribeca"&gt;documentary about emoji creation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqofne"&gt;“The use of emoji in medicine is really interesting, precisely because in many cases we’re dealing with sort of high stakes, and also very strong cultural practices,” says Lee. “So the more we can move into a curated universal visual medium, the better it can be in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ncokwf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s tricky to get more organs in the mix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRUPhv"&gt;Lee is also a vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee. She thinks there’s value in adding more major organ emoji, but she suspects she’s in the minority on that position. Though the brain, anatomical heart, and lungs emoji were all approved, it’s tricky to get other organs in the mix because they’re not necessarily as recognizable and don’t have as much demand, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqo0m"&gt;If medical organizations established a set of important potential emoji and pushed for them to be added, they might have more luck. “I would guess if the industry as a whole, the professional organizations, cared, they could move the needle,” says Lee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLqGu"&gt;Though a few other doctors have expressed desires for more relevant emoji, we don’t know yet how much traction He’s proposal will pick up. There’d likely need to be more studies around patient’s perceptions of emoji before medical associations throw their weight behind any formal efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cz3EW"&gt;It might not seem like emoji should be a big priority in the medical field, but He thinks anything that improves communication between doctors and patients is worthwhile. Being a doctor “means to listen, to hear their pain and hear their struggle, and to hear exactly what they’re trying to go through, and to help them,” He says. “If we can’t communicate, then we can’t be good doctors. And so this is at the very heart of being a good doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 may be released on October 4th </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MiOk6PdqLVJjXTWY02vx1m3jnPg=/0x0:620x413/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852678/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03WtKl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; may be released on October 4th, according to an internal document &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-stable-release-date-rumor/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The next version of Google’s mobile operating system features the new Material You visual design and has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;in public beta since May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTUPH"&gt;The document is used by Google to inform OEM partners when it will stop approving software builds for the various versions of Android (which it does for every software update to maintain compatibility with Google Mobile Services), according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;. October 4th is the date Google lists as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) release of Android 12 in the document. &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman notes that these AOSP release dates typically fall on the same day as the launch of a stable release of Android 12 for customers. You can see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1437085889885310976?s=20"&gt;Rahman’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; containing a screenshot of the document below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGdNQf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Android 12 stable update may be released on October 4, as that's when Google plans to release to AOSP. This tentative release date was also mentioned by a 3PL. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PMN802gQj0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PMN802gQj0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1437085889885310976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaYMWd"&gt;There’s an easy way to lend credence to that October 4th date: compare the release dates of Android 11 and Android 10 to what the document contains. The stable version of Android 10 was released out of beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20842507/google-android-10-q-pixel-release-download-availability"&gt;on September 3rd, 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just like the document lists. September 8th, 2020, the day Google says was the AOSP release of Android 11, was also the same day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427153/android-11-official-launch-google-pixel-oneplus-8-xiaomi-oppo-realme-update"&gt;the software was released to the public&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not hard confirmation, but it does make October 4th, 2021 seem a lot more likely as an Android 12 release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qou1Kx"&gt;Targeting some date in October would also put Android 12 in the general ballpark of when Google is expected to finally announce (as in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;stop teasing&lt;/a&gt; and actually detail) the Pixel 6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;Rumors spun out of Google’s own marketing&lt;/a&gt; target October 19th for the launch of Google’s flagship. Starting the rollout of Android 12 a couple of weeks before certainly seems like a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden to nominate facial recognition critic to FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4J044MXXWLlF9TWLVS7i2Nx37g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852385/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dmguuC"&gt;President Joe Biden is expected to nominate privacy hawk Alvaro Bedoya to the Federal Trade Commission, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-to-tap-privacy-hawk-for-ftc-post-928e807e-14f0-49ba-9585-50c9df171a04.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmhSOl"&gt;Bedoya is a professor at Georgetown University’s law school, focusing on privacy law. If confirmed, he would replace current Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who was nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year. In 2014, Bedoya founded Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology. He also served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law under the chairmanship of Sen. Al Franken (D-MN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUiMmo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bedoya’s expected nomination comes at a time when the FTC has faced heightened scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EhJXDe"&gt;A naturalized immigrant from Peru, Bedoya has researched the effects of technologies like facial recognition on minority groups. The Center on Privacy and Technology was particularly critical of facial recognition during his tenure, producing &lt;a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.flawedfacedata.com/"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; of the technology’s expanding scope and potential for racial bias. In 2015, Bedoya, along with eight other advocates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/16/8786885/privacy-advocates-quit-facial-recognition-group-in-protest"&gt;withdrew from a Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; privacy and facial recognition forum, arguing that the project would not do enough to protect consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3CYhR"&gt;Bedoya’s expected nomination comes at a time when the FTC has faced heightened scrutiny over its light-handed approach to privacy regulation. In 2019, the FTC settled with Facebook over its Cambridge Analytica scandal, securing a $5 billion fine and a number of new consumer protection promises. Despite the large number, the settlement was seen by many, including Democratic commissioners, as not going for enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXvM2h"&gt;At the time, Chopra &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying, “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxL8Hd"&gt;In July, the FTC approved a new rulemaking process that could &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-vote-could-pave-way-for-new-privacy-rules-11625171274"&gt;make it easier for the agency&lt;/a&gt; to enact new privacy rules on its own — without the help of Congress. If confirmed, Bedoya would likely help guide any new privacy-related rulemakings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgzgpF"&gt;The White House has yet to formally nominate Bedoya, as of publication. Once nominated, the Senate Commerce Committee would likely hold a confirmation hearing for Bedoya before voting to approve the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi0n93"&gt;FTC Chair Lina Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;was officially confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by the Senate in June. Over the last few months, she has laid out an aggressive antitrust agenda for the agency, especially as it pertains to the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hasn’t decided whether to appeal the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd07Y2G1J0y_cyh8iC04BbcEFWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852281/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyYrSd"&gt;Apple is still weighing whether to appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;last week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;antitrust ruling&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. In a call with reporters, a representative said Apple was still evaluating its legal options and had not made a decision about its next steps. The position contrasts sharply with Epic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it intends to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpwrPk"&gt;Apple reiterated a position it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;took last week&lt;/a&gt;, casting the ruling as a near-total victory. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dismissed nine of Epic’s 10 claims, including ones that would have required iOS to allow third-party app stores and payment processors. She ordered Epic to pay damages for breaching its developer contract. Apple also doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;return Epic’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the iOS App Store, and it can choose to terminate other Epic-affiliated developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3O8ah"&gt;Apple hasn’t taken a position on whether it will ban any Epic-related apps beyond &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Asked for comment, a representative said Apple is still looking at its options regarding Epic’s future on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm8ccl"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite"&gt;Epic said Apple&lt;/a&gt; might cut off support for the widely used Unreal Engine on iOS — a nuclear option in the conflict between them. That seems theoretically possible now, but Apple has publicly taken a measured tone so far, saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;“welcome” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back into the App Store&lt;/a&gt; if it removed its non-Apple in-app purchase option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XsB9s"&gt;While Apple won most claims, it was found to be violating California’s Unfair Competition Law with its anti-steering rules. A court order will require it to let developers link to alternate payment options outside their apps, although they still need to use Apple’s in-app purchase system within them. That order will take effect in December if Apple doesn’t appeal and win a delay of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtwMqZ"&gt;For now Apple says it’s studying how it could change its rules to comply with the order, which it characterized as line-editing Apple’s terms of service. But unsurprisingly, it doesn’t have any answers to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What comes next for the App Store?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vxzkF"&gt;On September 10th, a verdict finally arrived in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and it has left the App Store model in a precarious state. Epic wanted to do away with the system entirely, breaking Apple’s control over software distribution on iOS — but the ruling stopped well short of that. Instead, we got an ambiguously worded injunction that seems to open the door to developers skirting Apple’s commission system — or at least making it easier to use non-Apple payment methods outside their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2bJ1Y"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, Apple pushed to cast it as a victory — and Epic seemed sure it had lost. It’s understandable: until we see how Apple reacts and how the court looks on Epic’s recent appeal, it’s hard to know for sure what the injunction will actually mean. The ruling could be a significant leak in Apple’s carefully controlled ecosystem. But for that to happen, Epic and its allies will need a lot to break in their favor, both inside the courtroom and out. There are still lots of places for Apple to fight, and lots of ways to pare back developers’ small glimmer of a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLtFXm"&gt;Here are the four most important questions from those fights, the questions we’ll be watching particularly closely in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LUEC9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much freedom does this ruling actually give developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jos2mP"&gt;For all the complexities of the case, the actual order issued by the court is simple. It zeroes in on a single sentence in Apple’s App Store guidelines, which Apple is now forbidden from enforcing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfyla"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIjpkc"&gt;The one thing that’s clear is that developers have to be allowed some way to forward users to outside payment systems. But as my boss Nilay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;points out here&lt;/a&gt;, the “buttons” clause is ambiguous and could let developers make those systems look a lot like Apple’s official option, even if they open Safari or another app for the actual payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ePca6"&gt;Enforcing that interpretation will take a lot of legal work from developers and a lot of developer-friendly rulings in court. From the other side, there will be lots of opportunities for Apple to chip away at the injunction’s force. It’s hard to say how interested courts will be in defending it. But if they aren’t, the App Store could still be a very risky place for developers using alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMkF8u"&gt;In particular, there’s a real threat that Apple will still be able to impose the so-called Apple tax on whatever new payment system is allowed. In theory, the App Store’s commissions are levied to support the entire store, not just the payment system, and in her ruling, the judge considers the idea of Apple allowing alternate payment methods but requiring the same 30 percent cut via audits or other systems. (My colleague Adi explores this in the seventh section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;her deep dive on the ruling&lt;/a&gt;, under the heading “Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges.”) If that’s borne out in an actual legal order, the door would slam shut on alternate payment systems pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EDQ92r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will Apple change its App Store rules in response to this ruling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wlIOuT"&gt;The other half of the equation is Apple itself, which is almost certainly going to change its App Store rules if the order stands, if only to change the anti-steering clause. The specific rule about referring to outside payment systems is out, but Apple still has broad legal authority to write its own rules for the App Store. So what new rule will the company write to replace the old one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU0qdE"&gt;In particular, there are lots of ways Apple could discourage outside payments without banning them entirely. There’s the commission rate idea we’ve already discussed, but Apple could also place restrictions on how outside payment links are presented. The company could require specific price differentials between Apple’s IAP system and any competitors, and it could require the systems to be presented side by side — whatever the company thinks will pass muster with the court and keep developers using the Apple system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HcdZh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will external payments look like on the App Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vEXiBf"&gt;When the dust has settled on both those questions, developers will be left with some alternatives to Apple’s built-in payment system. It could be a simple button or a maze of links and forms — and a lot will be riding on where external payments land on that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flmTxP"&gt;The specific numbers on this are important, since developers will be balancing the cost of friction against the extra money they get from sidestepping Apple. On the face of it, a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style app will get an extra 30 cents for every dollar of in-app purchases that don’t go through Apple’s system (minus whatever fees the cost of providing the alternative service eats up). But it also seems likely that leaving Apple’s walled garden will add friction to the process, which means there will be fewer overall dollars being spent through the alternate path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McEMuJ"&gt;But how many fewer? If you lose four out of every ten customers by kicking to an outside payment system, then there’s no point putting it in place — but if it’s only two, you’ll still come out ahead. The specific UX details will make an enormous difference in determining that attrition rate: How large is the button? How many extra taps? Can Safari force you to enter in your credit card number each time you make a new purchase? Each extra step will nudge developers back toward IAP, and make Apple’s App Store profits that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UoerZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of the App Store will move to external payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WrL9vF"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s dream in launching this lawsuit was to break Apple’s control over software on iOS. That didn’t happen, and as long as the ruling holds up on appeal, Apple’s control over iOS looks more solid than ever. Under the rules of the injunction, the only way Sweeney can hurt Apple is if developers vote with their feet and leave, taking their commissions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsbZED"&gt;Apple is particularly dependent on big developers like Epic, which have enough profits to pay 30 percent commission rates and generate the bulk of the App Store’s revenue. Crucially, the court’s injunction isn’t limited to games or in-app payments, so there’s no telling how much of the developer base will leave Apple’s payment system. If that happens, Apple could be forced to switch to give up the commission system for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4h2Rx"&gt;So far, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;doesn’t look like that’s happening&lt;/a&gt;. The response from most developers has been noncommittal, and some already seem to think it won’t make sense for them to pursue payments outside the Apple system. But with the actual changes still months away (and already under appeal), it makes sense for developers to wait and see whether the new system is worth pursuing. But after the many possibilities opened up on Friday, it seems hard to believe none of them will be interested in exploring their options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook program reportedly let celebrities avoid moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fCPqgibTLw3o47GXbf8ly_uAUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851983/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp95A1"&gt;Facebook maintains an expansive program that exempts athletes, politicians, and other high-profile users from its typical moderation process, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program is reportedly meant to stop “PR fires,” or bad press caused by pulling down photos, posts, and other content from high-profile users that should have been allowed to stay up. In reality, the program just lets these users break the rules in ways that would have gotten most people into trouble, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33YOfl"&gt;The program is known as XCheck, or “cross check,” and it’s ostensibly meant to provide additional quality control around moderation when it comes to high-profile users, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Posts from users flagged for XCheck are supposed to be routed to a set of better-trained moderators to ensure Facebook’s rules are properly enforced. But the program reportedly protected 5.8 million people as of 2020, and just 10 percent of posts that hit XCheck actually get reviewed, according to a document seen by the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HfCMrK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says it’s “working to address” issues with XCheck&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0JcZ81"&gt;High-profile users protected by the program include former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Candace Owens, according to the report. Users are usually unaware that they’re being given special treatment, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8hjkc"&gt;Facebook told the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;that criticism of XCheck was warranted and the company is working to fix the program. The system is meant to “accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding,” a spokesperson said. They added that “Facebook itself identified the issues with cross check and has been working to address them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4JqSc"&gt;Andy Stone, Facebook’s policy communications manager, later responded to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s story on Twitter. Stone said that the system had been disclosed in the past, linking to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"&gt;a 2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt; where Facebook explains it has a “cross check” system to offer a “a second layer of review” for high-profile accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsDHBF"&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s added details don’t look great for Facebook, which has promised even enforcement of its rules, there’s a level on which none of this is particularly surprising. Facebook has a long and detailed set of moderation policies. But it’s always been clear that those policies are enforced at Facebook’s discretion, with leeway often granted to major names or questionable content when removal might lead to problems for the company. With the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report, it’s evident that in some cases, Facebook’s own system, by design or not, is helping keep some of those posts online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap9cMu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 13th, 3PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a response after publication, Facebook pointed to a prior disclosure of its cross-check program offering some details of how it worked. References to the program being a secret have been removed from this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is adding live translation services and coming to Facebook VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnFVqxSG_OeE5xC2t68V2GPiKJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851858/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNNwFC"&gt;Zoom plans to expand its support for automatic live transcriptions with the addition of live translation, and turn its whiteboard feature into a more of a fully-featured app, among several other changes the company announced at its Zoomtopia conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW8g54"&gt;Automatic live transcriptions / closed captions in English were announced to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;coming to free Zoom accounts in February 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Now Zoom says it “plans to provide real-time transcription for (as many as 30 additional languages) by the end of next year.” As part of that push, Zoom will also offer translation services for paid accounts, with the plan “to support real-time translation across as many as 12 languages by the end of next year.” Zoom wasn’t able to share details about which languages will be supported and when, but did say these improvements are a direct result of the machine learning know-how it gained by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556500/zoom-kites-acquisition-machine-translation-real-time-captions"&gt;acquiring German translation company Kites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yA1u4sf2OYWetoJ8kBl-BmM4fT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841259/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.04.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom Whiteboard, as accessed through the Zoom app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WEys5R"&gt;The other major change is coming to Zoom’s whiteboard feature. Zoom currently lets you &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard"&gt;create and share whiteboards during meetings&lt;/a&gt; to doodle together while you talk, but a planned expansion launching in beta later this year will make Zoom Whiteboard available outside of meetings in Zoom apps and the web. The basic drawing tools don’t appear to be different from what Zoom currently offers, the main change is how Zoom is treating Whiteboard as a product alongside video calls, rather than a feature that lives inside of them. You’ll be able to add sticky notes, drawings, and comments on your boards and view them whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ukWRl5SX0A6tI1NnHl6D-4AWZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841323/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.29.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A meeting in Horizon Workrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eh51lo"&gt;Early next year, Zoom is coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;. The shared VR meeting space will be able to host video meetings and connect to Zoom Whiteboard, according to Zoom. In VR, you can pin a Zoom Whiteboard to your virtual desk or to the wall for everyone to see, and draw along with colleagues attending a meeting through a traditional computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-6UqZDwvNgy-Cz-42lwAp-cYM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841327/widget.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zoom Widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jjD7r2"&gt;For a more comprehensive look at all the other changes Zoom is announcing at Zoomtopia 2021, including a new Zoom Widget shown in the gif above, &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-platform-enhancements-zoomtopia-2021/"&gt;head to the company’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
