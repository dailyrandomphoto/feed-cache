    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbU21Z"&gt;This past week I’ve been watching eBay, trying to decide if I should sell my PS5. I wouldn’t dream of becoming a scalper, but it’s getting hard to ignore just how much it’s worth. My daughter and I had beaten &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, so I thought I’d peek at the resale market. Wow, are they worth a lot! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6mp4T"&gt;And it’s not just the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; — I found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;3080&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;3070&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; graphics cards, and AMD’s rival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; GPUs are all commanding incredibly high prices on the resale market. It no longer surprises me how each big ticket holiday gaming gadget sells out nigh-instantly anytime they’re restocked; the incentive for scalpers is just too high. They’re so high even folks like me, who bought one intending to use it, might have to think twice. (That's capitalism for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM1f94"&gt;Example: The full-fat PlayStation 5 with a disc drive retails for $499.99. But it’s easily worth &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; that on eBay&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;averaged the actual final sale price of a hundred PS5s, subtracting a few sketchy outliers, to arrive at a street price of &lt;strong&gt;$1,024&lt;/strong&gt;. Mind you, that’s not the asking price: that’s what people are actually paying for these consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T37jXd"&gt;I ran the same numbers for the PS5 Digital Edition, the new Xboxes and all six graphics cards. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7ste80"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10207195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GNqZqB"&gt;I didn’t weed out any open-box or used consoles to get to these numbers, and you can easily see how strong the PS5’s demand is in particular: even the PS5 Digital Edition (without the disc drive) is worth nearly as much as the disc version that retails for $100 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJbU5F"&gt;While scanning through, I also saw that including extra games, controllers or accessories isn't even necessary: sometimes it was enough to justify an extra $100 or $200, but a PS5 didn’t need one to rake in $1K or more. (Some Xboxes with extra accessories seemed to be worth $50 to $100 more than others, but people are clearly buying for the consoles themselves.) All this means unless the situation changes drastically, the scalping isn’t going to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oaTsl"&gt;If there’s a bright spot for would-be console buyers, it’s that not every PS5 and Xbox listed on eBay is actually selling, even if quite a few are. In terms of volume, the PS5 and new Xboxes each moved around 1,000 units on eBay on December 3rd alone, but some $1,000 PS5 and $850 Xbox Series X listings ran out the clock without getting sold. (Most PS5 Digital Edition and Xbox Series S seemed to be selling, but there were also far fewer of them listed than the disc-based models.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MezkBm"&gt;On the PC side of things, the new Nvidia and AMD graphics cards appear to be in incredibly short supply judging by eBay listings, though. Almost every single card I saw found a buyer, save the most exorbitantly priced RTX 3090s — and even there, there were a handful of $2,400 and $2,500 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6QbSK-QZd8ca4tkVQn_pOm_2FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989909/twarren_201025_4262_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Unh7cL"&gt;The shortages feel very real: maybe a hundred RTX 3080 cards changed hands on December 3rd, even fewer RTX 3070 cards, and only 27 of the new AMD cards trickled down to eBay buyers that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLapNY"&gt;As we’ve discussed repeatedly at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, all of these items are practically impossible to buy at an actual store for their retail price right now. Unless you’re lucky, have connections, or are willing to pay for bots or scalpers, you might not be able to find one at all — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;retailers have don't have the right incentives to fix that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgCN3O"&gt;We like to think we’ve got some fast, savvy dealhunters on staff, but many of us are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564282/ps5-sony-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-orders-launch-week"&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt; to find a new GPU, PS5, or Xbox. Each and every supposed opportunity to buy is another shitshow. “Coming soon” is almost always immediately followed by “Out of stock,” and if we actually manage to get one into our digital shopping cart in that blink of an eye, it’ll often vanish before checkout. The December 2nd launch of the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti was no exception, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-3060-ti-launch-is-another-disappointment"&gt;with retailers failing to launch at the scheduled time and others gone before they actually appeared to be in stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGFb9o"&gt;Best Buy was a particular joy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9YJPxd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Annnd they yanked it right out of my cart. Great shopping experience once again, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BestBuy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hycn1LoGXW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hycn1LoGXW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1334167428872343555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNKhvi"&gt;It’s also fun to see GameStop and Newegg “restock” these products — where “restock” means &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Newegg/status/1334647866111848450"&gt;upselling us on bundles with unwanted extras&lt;/a&gt;. Can you blame them, though, when eBay shows even those buyers could get their money's worth based on the current supply and demand? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47YRMa"&gt;This pattern has played out many times before, and it's likely that supply will eventually catch up. Usually, these companies don't intentionally create scarcity, even if it felt like that to me in early 2008 when I camped out in a freezing Best Buy parking lot for a Nintendo Wii a full year &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; that console launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPXogL"&gt;But we are living through unprecedented times right now, with companies like Microsoft and Nvidia signaling it may be months before things even out. I can't remember a holiday season with this many must-have items, either: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickle_Me_Elmo#1996_Elmo_craze"&gt;Tickle Me Elmo&lt;/a&gt;, early Power Rangers and that Nintendo Wii were typically one-offs! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIrt6G"&gt;I’m still leaning against selling my PS5 on eBay; I just like the idea of trading it for an AMD RX 6800, like I suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt;, but it's no easier to find that GPU; it looks like I'd need most of the gains I'd see from selling the console to buy the card on eBay, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOeY97"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPn9PC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y1qf5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm33Q3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NY Times report about how police departments are using drones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aE0wlUME_5njitSQY6R7_YPLtX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466277/vpavic_190930_3698_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bMJkuY"&gt;As drones get smarter and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;issues more waivers&lt;/a&gt; for its drone regulations, we’re likely to see more law enforcement agencies using them in their day-to-day, including for 911 calls. The formidable &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cademetz"&gt;Cade Metz&lt;/a&gt; writes for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; about what this looks like in practice, and to be perfectly honest, it’s extremely disconcerting, as Chula Vista, California officers “chase” a “suspect” using a drone: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IvTYWH"&gt;When the man left the car, carrying a gun and a bag of heroin, a nearby police car had trouble following as he sprinted across the street and ducked behind a wall. But as he threw the gun into a dumpster and hid the bag of heroin, the drone, hovering above him, caught everything on camera. When he slipped through the back door of a strip mall, exited through the front door and ran down the sidewalk, it caught that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4LLxK"&gt;Watching the live video feed, an officer back at headquarters relayed the details to the police on the scene, who soon caught the man and took him into custody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FKOiq8"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the Chula Vista police department uses drones on around 15 emergency calls a day, part of its Drone as First Responder program. In July, the Chula Vista PD &lt;a href="https://medium.com/skydio/celebrating-chula-vistas-close-proximity-low-altitude-bvlos-waiver-d3f969c4b900"&gt;received approval&lt;/a&gt; to fly its Skydio drones beyond visual line of sight in emergency situations, but with conditions: It couldn’t fly higher than 50 feed above the nearest obstacle, had to stay within 1,500 feet of the pilot, and had to return to visual line of sight “as soon as practical” (however, that the drones used in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ example above were DJI drones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeTerK"&gt;Budget cuts for police departments are looming as local governments try to weather the economic downturn of the coronavirus pandemic. There’s also the push toward reexamining how police departments are funded, and drones provide a more cost-effective option than helicopters and pilots, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article notes. Plus, the drones can allow for “policing” that adheres to social distancing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVfXD"&gt;But as a policy analyst with the ACLU told the Times, the privacy concerns are considerable. Technology like drones “could allow law enforcement to enforce any area of the law against anyone they want.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxGp1G"&gt;To read more about how police departments can use drones and the myriad issues involved, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/technology/police-drones.html"&gt;unsettling report in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX has launched a second Dragon capsule to the space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRxxnM0QsuRkmAHctjLJPxFBzHE=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466117/CRS21_rollout_DSC_3152_scaled_1024x683.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Cargo Dragon spacecraft will launch Sunday from Kennedy Space Center&lt;/em&gt; | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRt61C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 6th, 11:35AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: SpaceX successfully launched its latest mission to the International Space Station, using its upgraded Dragon capsule that will dock with the station tomorrow at about 1:30PM ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsCAa8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original story:&lt;/strong&gt; This morning, SpaceX is set to launch its latest batch of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, but the company is using a slightly different spacecraft for this flight than resupply missions of the past. SpaceX is flying its newly upgraded Dragon capsule to transport the goods to space — the same vehicle that the company has been using to fly astronauts to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcVz1Z"&gt;SpaceX has been resupplying the space station since 2012, and for all of its 20 previous missions, the company has used the original version of its Dragon cargo capsule. SpaceX started developing a new Dragon capsule, though, to transport people to and from the ISS. Called Crew Dragon — or Dragon 2 — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;vehicle carried its first crew to space in May&lt;/a&gt;. With the new version operational, SpaceX decided to discontinue the use of its old Dragon capsule and use the upgraded version to carry both crew &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spQaCZ"&gt;The Dragon 2 capsule sports a number of upgrades over its predecessor; SpaceX says it can carry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1334502617465069575?s=20"&gt;50 percent more science payloads.&lt;/a&gt; The new Dragon is also capable of automatically docking with the space station. The previous version had to be berthed: it would slowly approach the ISS, while a crew member on board the station would use a robotic arm to grab the incoming capsule and move it onto an open docking port. Dragon 2 doesn’t need any help from humans to dock and attach itself to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eXjHM"&gt;This mission will bring supplies for the station and astronauts, and is also bringing several experiments to the ISS. They include the European Space Agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/09/BioAsteroid"&gt;Bioasteroid,&lt;/a&gt; which will test how biomining— the process of using microorganisms to extract elements from rocks— is affected by microgravity. The mission also will have the first &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/COVID-19_drug_research_and_bio-mining_launching_to_the_International_Space_Station"&gt;COVID-19 drug research experiment&lt;/a&gt; in space on board, to try to improve the efficiency of antiviral drug remdesivir. Also on board will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437672/nanoracks-bishop-commercial-airlock-spacex-international-space-station-satellite-deployment"&gt;Nanorocks’ commercial airlock module&lt;/a&gt;— basically a large metal cup that attaches to the exterior of the ISS— designed to get payloads and other materials from inside the pressurized environment of the ISS out into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FBs2T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dcy4yZb13fE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pue6YM"&gt;Once this capsule reaches the space station, it won’t be the only Dragon attached to the ISS. On November 15th, SpaceX launched a crew of four to the ISS on another Dragon capsule, which docked with the station a day later. That means there will be two Dragons docked at the ISS after this flight gets off the ground. “It’ll be the first time that there are two Dragons on the space station simultaneously,” Sarah Walker, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of the flight. “And it really ushers in a season of continuous Dragon presence for the near future, at least through the end of 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBEaeW"&gt;The mission was rescheduled due to weather concerns but is now slated to launch at 11:17AM ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX is using one of its used Falcon 9 rockets for the mission, a vehicle that’s flown three times before. In fact, it’s the same rocket that launched SpaceX’s first crew of two the station in May. After the flight, the Falcon 9 will attempt to land on one of SpaceX’s drone ships in the Atlantic. The Dragon capsule is expected to dock with the ISS on December 7th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Chang’e 5 completes docking mission on its way back to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo taken at Beijing Aerospace Control Center BACC in Beijing on Dec. 3, 2020 shows the ascender of Chang’e-5 spacecraft flying above the lunar surface. The Chinese spacecraft carrying the country’s first lunar samples blasted off from the moon late Thursday, the China National Space Administration announced. This represented the first-ever Chinese spacecraft to take off from an extraterrestrial body.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GQ5lcz4YSQT3ZkbSjthwwmOXC4U=/0x0:3648x2432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68464199/1229950115.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jj58S2"&gt;China’s Chang’e-5 mission completed a tricky docking maneuver on Saturday, as it prepares to return the soil samples it collected from the Moon’s surface back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f24fkD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;Chang’e 5 launched on November 23rd&lt;/a&gt; atop a Long March 5 rocket, with four main spacecraft. The mission entered the lunar orbit on November 28th, and its lander and ascent vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21724067/china-lunar-mission-change-5-moon-soil-samples"&gt;landed on the Moon December 1st&lt;/a&gt;, while its service module remained in lunar orbit. The lander gathered rocks and soil, and on Saturday, docked in orbit with the service module. Those samples will now be put in a return capsule for the trip home, expected to land in Inner Mongolia later in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiC6c9"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB7JIs"&gt;If the mission is successful, it will make China only the third country to return samples from the Moon, more than 50 years after the US Apollo missions. The last successful lunar sample return mission was the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLWMtW"&gt;Also on Saturday, Japan’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155825/jaxa-hayabusa2-mission-asteroid-sample-return-landing-australia"&gt;Hayabusa2 mission landed in the Australian desert&lt;/a&gt;, after retrieving samples of the Ryugu asteroid. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla diversity report shows its US leadership is 59 percent white and 83 percent male </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2UMRBia2lDuNYoSYIT-bim0P8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68464002/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBgUYr"&gt;Tesla published its first-ever diversity report on Friday, which shows the automaker’s US leadership is 83 percent male, and 59 percent white. The &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/us-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-report"&gt;Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Impact report&lt;/a&gt; shows that men represent 79 percent of Tesla’s workforce, and women 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s92IPH"&gt;“While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,” the report states. “Increasing women’s representation at all levels, especially in leadership, is a top priority in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMJNJx"&gt;The company also acknowledges in the report that Black employees are underrepresented— only 10 percent of the workforce and 4 percent of leadership at Tesla are Black or African-American. “We know that our numbers do not represent the deep talent pools of Black and African American talent that exist in the US at every level,” the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AOAAF"&gt;The company says Black and African-American employees made up 12 percent of new hires at the company in 2020, which is a 9 percent increase from 2019. It plans to conduct more recruitment at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and provide its managers and recruiters with unconscious bias training, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cj6A3"&gt;Asian employees make up 21 percent of Tesla’s workforce and 25 percent of company leadership, and Hispanic or Latino/Latina employees represent 22 percent of its total workforce, but only 4 percent of leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS0jg"&gt;Tesla’s report is somewhat incomplete, however; it does not detail attrition or retention rates at the company, or provide details about how many of its employees identify as non-binary or gender nonconforming, or, how many identify as having a disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfKni"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japan’s asteroid sample return mission lands in Australian desert</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cExQ8"&gt;After spending six years in space, a Japanese spacecraft just landed in the desert of southern Australia, bringing a small cache of asteroid rocks to the surface of Earth. It’s only the second time in history that materials from an asteroid have been returned to our planet. Eventually, scientists will open the spacecraft up, uncovering the precious rocks within to learn more about the asteroids that permeate our Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD89BN"&gt;The landing is the culmination of Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission, aimed at bringing samples of an asteroid back to Earth. After launching from Japan in 2014, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft spent four years journeying to an asteroid named Ryugu. The vehicle spent a year and a half hanging around the asteroid, mapping the rock’s surface and grabbing samples of material before heading back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="teSn4G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbETnX"&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned, as pristine samples from an asteroid could tell us a lot more about what our Solar System was like when the planets were first forming. That’s because asteroids are a bit like baby pictures of our cosmic neighborhood. These space rocks have been around since the dawn of the Solar System, and scientists believe asteroids haven’t really changed much over the last 4.6 billion years. These objects contain many of the same materials that were present at the Solar System’s birth, so studying these rocks in labs here on Earth could provide key context about the early days of the planets.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAXA mission controllers celebrating the successful capsule separation of Hayabusa2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YXgCBm"&gt;The capsule will be transported to Japan, where we’ll learn how much asteroid material the mission gathered. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which oversees the mission, hoped to bring back 100 milligrams of material from Ryugu, but scientists didn’t have a way to measure how much sample Hayabusa2 had collected while in space. That exact amount will be revealed when the spacecraft is opened in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DS6IWS"&gt;Hayabusa2 used some creative techniques for collecting its samples at Ryugu. Equipped with a small horn-shaped arm, the spacecraft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234782/jaxa-hayabusa-2-ryugu-asteroid-sample-return-mission"&gt;tapped the asteroid with this appendage in February of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. When the arm made contact, it shot out a bullet-like projectile that punctured the asteroid, releasing a whole mess of dust and pebbles that hopefully went up into the horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7JyYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDkhp"&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu, though. Hayabusa2 tried this maneuver again in July of 2019, but the spacecraft had done a bit of excavating first. Before &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+verge+hayabusa2&amp;amp;oq=the+verge&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i59l2j0j69i60l2.1277j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;tapping the asteroid a second time&lt;/a&gt;, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295964/japan-spacecraft-asteroid-ryugu-hayabusa2-sci-explosion-crater"&gt;dropped a can of explosives onto Ryugu&lt;/a&gt;, blasting a crater on the asteroid and revealing some of the rocks located just below the surface. Hayabusa2 then tapped the surface inside this crater to scoop up some of this newly exposed material. The goal was to gather even more pristine rocks from Ryugu. The material underneath the asteroid’s surface hasn’t been exposed to the harsh environment of space for billions of years like the rocks on the exterior, which have likely experienced some change and reactions over time. So the material from the crater could provide an even better snapshot of the materials that were present when the Solar System first formed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kACHjV"&gt;Once the Hayabusa2 team felt confident they had grabbed enough from Ryugu, the spacecraft left the asteroid in November of 2019. After spending the last year traveling to Earth, the spacecraft deployed a small capsule late Friday night, with the samples of Ryugu located inside. The capsule then set on a course for Earth, plunging through our planet’s atmosphere this morning. It then deployed a parachute, slowing the vehicle from about 12 kilometers per second, or nearly 27,000 miles per hour, so that it could land gently in the  Woomera Prohibited Area in southern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tcyqtq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;teams from JAXA will go on an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4OOjV"&gt;After it hit the ground teams from JAXA went on &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201204_ts4/"&gt;an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle came down in an area that covers 100 square kilometers, or around 38 square miles. It also landed at nighttime in Australia, making the capsule even more difficult to spot. Fortunately, the capsule was equipped with a radio beacon that &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.slack.com/archives/DRQA3DNBT/p1607200317008800"&gt;helped teams locate&lt;/a&gt; where the spacecraft touched down. Before the landing, JAXA teams set up five antennas around the expected landing site to help find the signal, and the agency also had a helicopter with its own beacon receiver to help narrow down the search. A drone was also on hand to fly overhead of the area to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANg7pR"&gt;Hayabusa2 is Japan’s second mission to retrieve samples of an asteroid. Its first mission, Hayabusa, returned asteroid samples to Earth in 2010, though the mission only managed to collect tiny grains of asteroid material. Hayabusa2 will hopefully have collected even more than the original Hayabusa’s offerings. And in 2023, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to return the largest sample of material from an asteroid ever collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t05Sh4"&gt;Though Hayabusa2 has completed its primary mission, the spacecraft isn’t quite done yet. The main spacecraft is still in space and &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201116_extMission/"&gt;just set out on a quest to visit another asteroid&lt;/a&gt; called 1998 KY26. It’ll take Hayabusa2 11 years to reach its new target, with the goal of analyzing the space rock and learning even more about the asteroids that zoom around us in space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru’s actual paper may explain why Google ejected her</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AH83Isg1SKmFF3CA3dzPx15WBCc=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68463594/1028811892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zOuBWr"&gt;A paper co-authored by former Google AI ethicist Timnit Gebru raised some potentially thorny questions for Google about whether AI language models may be too big, and whether tech companies are doing enough to reduce potential risks, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The paper also questioned the environmental costs and inherent biases in large language models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdsCdU"&gt;Google’s AI team created such a language model— &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html"&gt;BERT— in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and it was so successful that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;incorporated BERT into its search engine&lt;/a&gt;. Search is a highly lucrative segment of Google’s business; in the third quarter of this year alone, it brought in revenue of $26.3 billion. “This year, including this quarter, showed how valuable Google’s founding product — search — has been to people,” CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21531711/google-alphabet-ad-revenue-youtube-waymo-cloud-search"&gt;Sundar Pichai said on a call with investors&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlYBQg"&gt;Gebru and her team submitted their paper, titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” for a research conference. She said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334343577044979712"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that following an internal review, she was asked to retract the paper or remove Google employees’ names from it. She says she asked Google for conditions for taking her name off the paper, and if they couldn’t meet the conditions they could “work on a last date.” Gebru says she then received an email from Google informing her they were “accepting her resignation effective immediately.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F05ZUL"&gt;The head of Google AI, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;Jeff Dean, wrote in an email to employees&lt;/a&gt; that the paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication.” He wrote that one of Gebru’s conditions for continuing to work at Google was for the company to tell her who had reviewed the paper and their specific feedback, which it declined to do. “Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google,” Dean wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qYAyG6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gebru is known for her work on algorithmic bias, especially in facial recognition technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lf76oL"&gt;In his letter, Dean wrote that the paper “ignored too much relevant research,” a claim that the paper’s co-author Emily M. Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, disputed. Bender told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the paper, which had six collaborators, was “the sort of work that no individual or even pair of authors can pull off,” noting it had a citation list of 128 references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG2mKU"&gt;Gebru is known for her work on algorithmic bias, especially in facial recognition technology. In 2018, she co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini that showed error rates for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;identifying darker-skinned people were much higher&lt;/a&gt; than error rates for identifying lighter-skinned people, since the datasets used to train algorithms were overwhelmingly white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvc9tx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/"&gt;Gebru told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday that she felt she was being censored. “You’re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don’t point out problems,” she said. “That’s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fxl13"&gt;Since news of her termination became public, thousands of supporters, including more than 1,500 Google employees have signed a letter of protest. “We, the undersigned, stand in solidarity with Dr. Timnit Gebru, who was terminated from her position as Staff Research Scientist and Co-Lead of Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) team at Google, following unprecedented research censorship,” reads the &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;petition, titled Standing with Dr. Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zORzgt"&gt;“We call on Google Research to strengthen its commitment to research integrity and to unequivocally commit to supporting research that honors the commitments made in Google’s AI Principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPlM8q"&gt;The petitioners are demanding that Dean and others “who were involved with the decision to censor Dr. Gebru’s paper meet with the Ethical AI team to explain the process by which the paper was unilaterally rejected by leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iULwK2"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjMxfB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leftovers you can’t eat: Black Friday deals you can still get</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0G_u3DPUQg__QirbpSVS1jdIyI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68463022/IMG_0625-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;This weekend, you can enjoy the last of the leftovers — not Thanksgiving leftovers. (There’s still no end in sight for those at my house.) I’m talking about the deals left over from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s a relative drought compared to the number of sales we saw last weekend in the thick of it all, but you can still get some of this year’s best prices on headphones, video games, and smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czy1ds"&gt;Here are this week’s best deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OiHIXW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CpGTxi"&gt;The headphones with arguably the most effective noise cancellation tech and best sound quality for the price are the Sony WH-1000XM4. They were down to $278 during Black Friday, but their current $298 price is still a good buy if you missed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zda7L8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4JS17"&gt;The price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live is back down to the Black Friday deal we saw last week. At Woot, they cost $110, matching the lowest price yet, and you can have at your choice of color. These will arrive by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="u7ze3L"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="INGUDX"&gt;Smart speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OjwoAb"&gt;The Sonos One (gen 2) is $40 off its original $200 price at Best Buy, Amazon, and through Sonos itself. This model features microphones for smart assistant support (Google Assistant, Alexa), and it’ll work alone or connected via Wi-Fi to other Sonos speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zUvJQQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5iOMh"&gt;Amazon’s new lineup of Echo smart speakers that released this fall has received some big discounts lately, and perhaps the most appealing from a value perspective is the spherical Echo Dot for $29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39vJ5l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="A2ey4u"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3ooamK"&gt;Video games&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRjaCpdNZS-Z545s1XVCsD1Oetc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21920671/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WeihPa"&gt;If you haven’t yet signed up for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft is offering a three-month subscription to the Game Pass Ultimate service (combining Xbox Live, Game Pass for console, PC, and Android via xCloud) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Ficid%3DXboxDealsCat_TopStripe_GamePassUltimate%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1 through its site&lt;/a&gt;. Since EA Play joined Game Pass, there are now even more games to play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk reportedly plans to move to Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Awarded With Axel Springer Award In Berlin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-Y0LsGYapj9TAWrOlkjLab1p4=/0x19:5333x3574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68462958/1229892934.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Britta Pedersen-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFSxTo"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is planning to move from California to Texas, a move that would potentially save him from a huge personal income tax bill, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-plans-to-move-to-texas-friends-and-associates-say.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4q4qM"&gt;Musk announced in July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;Tesla was building its next US factory in Austin,&lt;/a&gt; where it will produce its Cybertruck, Model Y, Model 3, and Semi vehicles. The company received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323977/austin-tesla-tax-breaks-travis-county-cybertruck-factory-incentives"&gt;tens of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in local property tax breaks to build the plant on 2,100 acres east of Austin’s airport, over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300909/tesla-austin-cybertruck-gigafactory-elon-musk-tax-breaks"&gt;objections of some local residents&lt;/a&gt;. The factory is expected to begin delivering its first vehicles in 2021. Musk’s Boring Company already has operations in Austin, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/29/20889605/spacex-elon-musk-starship-rocket-update-pictures-mk1"&gt;SpaceX has a facility&lt;/a&gt; in Boca Chica, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqqtY0"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he was “selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdEzEx"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201651/tesla-fremont-factory-covid-19-coronavirus-shutdown-shelter-in-place"&gt;battled with officials in California&lt;/a&gt; in recent months over pandemic lockdown orders that temporarily shuttered Tesla’s Fremont plant. In May, Musk said he was going to move the automaker out of state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fVNyf5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259162367285317633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6r6hxP"&gt;In November, Tesla said employees at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587781/tesla-workers-california-fremont-exempt-new-covid-19-order-newsom"&gt;Fremont plant were “essential workers”&lt;/a&gt; and exempt from California’s new statewide COVID-19 health orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S52fn4"&gt;If Musk does change his permanent address to Texas, he’d pay significantly less in taxes, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;notes. Musk stands to earn more than $50 billion in stock options, and would have to pay income taxes on the profits when he exercises them if he remained in California. Texas, however, has &lt;a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.8.htm"&gt;no personal income tax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGfZYh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preparation for a big COVID-19 vaccine rollout is underway </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dX1uMk"&gt;In the US, COVID-19 vaccines are just around the corner, leaving the entire country peering out the window in anticipation of their arrival. Officials and healthcare systems, already taxed by &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/the-worst-case-scenario-is-happening-hospitals-are-overwhelmed/617301/"&gt;skyrocketing case counts&lt;/a&gt; are making sure that everything is prepared when they show up. Here’s a few things still on their vaccine to-do lists: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkwcrj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save the dates: &lt;/strong&gt;In the next few weeks, committees with the Food and Drug Administration will meet to decide whether or not to authorize vaccine candidates for Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna. The Pfizer vaccine is up first, with a meeting &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-december-10-2020-meeting-announcement"&gt;scheduled for December 10th&lt;/a&gt;. Moderna’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-second-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;meeting will happen a week later, on December 17&lt;/a&gt;. The committee will meet to discuss the mountains of data from the clinical trials, and decide if they are safe and effective enough to be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SADE3U"&gt;While the US is taking some time to do thorough background checks on the vaccines, others have expedited the process. This week, the UK authorized the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/02/u-k-approves-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-putting-pressure-on-fda/"&gt;putting pressure on the US&lt;/a&gt; to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yjopOK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F3TlO7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seating arrangements: &lt;/strong&gt;Once the FDA has decided which vaccines are invited to the party, states need to have a plan for their allotted doses. Friday, December 5 was the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/states-submit-vaccine-orders-coronavirus-death-toll-grows-74544381"&gt;deadline for states to place orders for the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this week, a committee of the CDC met to finalize their recommendations as to who should get the vaccine first. The VIPs who are most likely to receive the vaccine first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;are healthcare workers&lt;/a&gt; and people living and working in long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKx8qL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menu planning: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587664/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-two-doses-shots"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine front runners are both two dose vaccines, and the vaccines have to be given weeks apart. This is a challenge for states who now have to make sure that everyone gets the right vaccine at the right time. They plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153908/covid-vaccine-dose-tracking-digital-registry-fda"&gt;use digital databases&lt;/a&gt; to track who got which vaccine, and when they got their shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTBTJb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing out the fridge(s): &lt;/strong&gt;These vaccines have to be kept very cold. They can both stay potent for a while at refrigerator-like temperatures, but for longer-term storage Pfizer / BioNTech’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;needs to chill at minus 70 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt;. That has states clearing out cold storage and buying up dry ice anywhere they can as they prep for the vaccine’s arrival. In Maine, community college freezers may be pressed into service as the state starts vaccinating more people, the head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/maine-covid-vaccine-distribution-plan.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzQw4l"&gt;There’s still a lot more to do before the first doses start trickling in. First on the priority list, there’s a surge of cases and hospitalizations that must be stopped. Then, transparent plans and communications need to set the tone for a vaccine campaign. The vaccines need to be delivered equitably, and researchers will have to keep a watchful eye on the long-term effects of the vaccines. But if all of those can be accomplished, and this hastily-planned vaccine effort can be pulled off, it will be a triumph. &lt;/p&gt;

There’s still a dearth of data, but some fascinating studies are coming out, including a recent one from South Korea, broken down in this article by sociologist Zeynep Tufekci. Tufekci’s newsletter &lt;em&gt;Insight &lt;/em&gt;is worth a read — &lt;a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-pandemic-heroes-who-gave-us-the"&gt;another post this week&lt;/a&gt; highlights the efforts of Chinese researchers to sound the an early alarm on this virus.&lt;br&gt;(Zeynep Tufekci&lt;em&gt;/Insight&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

The reason why? It hopes more people will stick to a shorter quarantine schedule. Later in the week, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/04/cdc-mask-guidance-indoors/"&gt;agency urged ‘universal face mask use’&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6949e2.htm?s_cid=mm6949e2_w"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;(German Lopez/&lt;em&gt;Vox)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
