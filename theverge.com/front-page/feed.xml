  &lt;p id="sF3Fxw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford just unveiled the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, its first electric pickup truck. And as has become tradition in the EV world, a mere $100 deposit can get you in line for one when these rigs eventually begin to roll off the assembly line starting in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqZNta"&gt;The trucks are available for reservation &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/2022/#reservations"&gt;at this website&lt;/a&gt;. The standard range model starts at $39,974, and will get around 250 miles of range. An extended range version starts at $52,974 and can travel up to 300 miles on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WEA6bq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Deposits are fully refundable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibZy1r"&gt;Deposits are fully refundable, but if you want to follow through on your purchase, orders can be completed starting in fall 2021. And deliveries are expected to start in the spring of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h33TAW"&gt;Ford’s website features details about the base model, as well as the XLT, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels. Ford says that a fully loaded F-150 Lightning will cost $90,474 — although Ford is still eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in the US. A commercial version of the F-150 Lightning will be revealed at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTaMohoeSAU-rNxgvYGTD-8jc7c=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314600/2_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Up to 300 miles of range starting at just under $40,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Syw3vD"&gt;The most popular vehicle in the United States is going electric. Ford has revealed the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version of its popular pickup truck due out in 2022, and it’s aggressively priced for an EV. The base model with 230 miles of range starts at $39,974, while the extended range version starts in the mid-$50,000s and can go about 300 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK3cFL"&gt;That puts it right on par, price-wise, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; and far below more luxury-minded options like Rivian’s R1T or General Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;exorbitant GMC Hummer pickup&lt;/a&gt;. And since Ford’s vehicles are still eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, that price tag can essentially come down even more for early buyers. It’s especially stunning, though, because all variants of the F-150 Lightning are built with Ford’s four-door “SuperCrew” cab, the gas version of which starts at $36,650. The base model Lightning is even slightly cheaper than its comparable hybrid F-150 counterpart. Most electric vehicles to date have cost more than their gas counterparts, but Ford is the closest to bucking that trend. Ford has already started &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/2022/#reservations"&gt;taking reservations for $100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t439kP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Priced like the Cybertruck as well as Ford’s hybrid F-150&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvmEPu"&gt;There are a few sacrifices in that base model aside from range, but nothing that seems terribly prohibitive. And while sticker price isn’t everything when it comes to electric vehicles, it is a big barrier for many buyers. The F-150 Lightning’s price goes up with added features and extra range, but from what Ford revealed Wednesday night, the company looks ready to convince a wide swathe of customers to consider electric when they go to buy their next F-150, with little regard to what price point they’re shopping at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IVomh"&gt;Those willing to make the jump will find a truck overflowing with utility features, including a lot of ideas that Ford has already offered on the gas-powered model (like a fold-out center console work surface) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303479/ford-2021-f-150-active-drive-assist-hybrid-specs-features-photos"&gt;hybrid version&lt;/a&gt; (like the onboard charger). It has a few unique tricks that may make buyers who are skittish about range or price think twice, too. And it all comes wrapped in an exterior design that is almost indistinguishable from its internal combustion counterparts, save for a new grille with a striking continuous light bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9skkpC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are lots of flavors of soda, but there’s only one Coke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xTDEn7"&gt;In fact, the F-150 Lightning is by far the most familiar-looking of the electric pickups announced to date. And Ford is betting big that this unchallenging boxy design — which Elon Musk poked fun at during the Cybertruck announcement in 2019 — will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5Kd3a"&gt;“There’s plenty of space for everybody. What matters is we’re all true to ourselves,” Darren Palmer, the head of Ford’s EV division, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “I think there’s enough to tempt people to look at [buying the electric version], and a good percent already were — we saw that in our research. But I think it’s going to tempt people who weren’t even looking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGUlEK"&gt;Or as Ford CEO Jim Farley said on &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast, which comes out Thursday morning: “There are lots of flavors of soda, but there’s only one Coke, and there’ll be lots of electric pickup trucks, [but] there’s only one F-150.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56ivbBT4lvZKkLXQ34C5YkSB9wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526645/3_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3BtF5v"&gt;Power play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4rIe6y"&gt;The F-150 Lightning comes in two battery configurations. The company says the standard range battery should get around 230 miles of range, while the extended range battery should be good for 300 miles (though neither spec has been officially rated by the Environmental Protection Agency yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEAEOu"&gt;Either of those configurations should be good for most daily driving scenarios, though many people will want to do typical truck things with the F-150 Lightning that are naturally more energy-intensive, like towing, hauling, or off-roading. To put those potential owners’ minds at ease, Ford says the truck’s software can provide real-time range estimates, something it’s already been working on in the Mustang Mach-E. This software factors in not just weather and traffic conditions, but it also uses an onboard scale to measure the weight of any payload or towing weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHpJJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Towing and hauling will sap some range, but Ford’s betting on accurate estimates to calm nerves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QNi7VK"&gt;Ford announced last month that it was bringing this onboard scale technology to all F-150s, though it seems particularly useful for the Lightning — especially since Ford hasn’t compromised a ton on towing or payload capacity with its first serious electric truck. (Hi, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger_EV"&gt;Ford Ranger EV&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiiTvx"&gt;The extended range Lightning is able to tow up to 10,000 pounds, which is more than what most affordable gas-powered F-150s are capable of, though it’s a few thousand pounds shy of what the F-150 hybrid or the diesel version can tow. The standard range F-150 Lightning, meanwhile, maxes out at 7,700 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCdoD5"&gt;But because of the weight difference in the battery packs, the standard range Lightning wins out on payload capacity, as it can carry up to 2,000 pounds versus the extended rage’s 1,800-pound max. Still, these figures fall roughly in the middle of what you can find across the full range of F-150s. (Larger F-Series trucks, of course, can pull and haul more — no word on when those might get electrified just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-AYZZcdB4H8rvj-tuYURSfJs4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526648/5_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6SrougeG0yhnTo-YKCvWNaaW7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526647/4_16X9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybAkhJInH3dzGUK7Cz7bJOD2wN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526650/8_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0IXzJB"&gt;All versions of the F-150 Lightning will put their battery power down via two electric motors — one up front and one in back — meaning every buyer gets an all-wheel drive setup. The extended range version sounds like it could easily knock the wind out of you, with 420kW of total power (563 horsepower) and 775 pound-feet of torque. That’s good enough to make it the quickest F-150 ever made, with the ability to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in the mid-4 second range. The standard range Lightning isn’t much worse off, with 318kW of power (426 horsepower) and the same amount of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1uIBv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charging is still a minefield&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eAzXrv"&gt;That all sounds fun (and also a little bit ludicrous for a big truck), but all this power is only so good as long as you can easily charge the electric F-150 back up. Charging is still a sore spot for most EVs, and it’s what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video#:~:text=The%20Mach%2DE%20is%20solidly,ones%20like%20the%20Chevy%20Bolt."&gt;sapped some of the fun out of my time with the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. The truth is, unless Ford invests in building out its own dedicated network, there’s only so much the company can do between now and when the Lightning hits the road to make the public charging experience better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01fWAv"&gt;In the meantime, Ford’s band-aid solution is that it has coalesced a handful of disparate independent public charging networks into what it calls the FordPass Charging Network. All of these chargers show up in the FordPass smartphone app as if they are one large network, and Ford is even working with some so that owners don’t need to create new accounts or download other apps to start charging. It’s a great idea in theory, but it needs more work — hopefully progress can be made by the time the F-150 Lightning hits the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UfYBY"&gt;The quickest option to recharge the F-150 Lightning is at a 150kW DC fast charging station. At one of these plugs, the F-150 Lightning with the extended range battery can take on about 54 miles of range in 10 minutes and can charge from 15 percent to 80 percent in 41 minutes. The standard range battery will take longer, though: it can take on 41 miles of range in 10 minutes at a 150kW charging station, and it takes 44 minutes to charge from 15 to 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ob6zwujow2cX4-Xze4Wk5nsXd3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526676/5_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbZkSQ"&gt;At home, a 120-volt outlet will trickle 3 miles per hour into the battery, while a 240-volt outlet can add around 14 miles per hour. The real standout charging feature is exclusive to the versions of the F-150 Lightning powered by the extended range battery. Ford is including a new 80-amp home charging station that not only fully charges the F-150 Lightning in eight hours but allows owners to easily power their entire home for around three days in the event of an electricity outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rsojTI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People like to be self reliant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3EMfk"&gt;The ability to draw power from the battery pack isn’t limited to these extreme scenarios, though. All of the base trims of the F-150 Lightning can put out 2.4kW of onboard power, and the more expensive Lariat and Platinum trims offer a total of 9.6kW of onboard power. The more expensive F-150 Lightnings have 11 built-in power sockets — seven in the cab and bed, including a 240V outlet, and four in the front trunk — plus a handful of USB ports. Ford began playing with this idea of turning a vehicle into a mobile generator of sorts with the F-150 hybrid, but the higher trims of the F-150 Lightning will offer even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; onboard power, and they won’t use gas to generate it. That’s not only a great feature for anyone who needs power on the go, but it could be a huge benefit for fleet operators or small businesses looking to go green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIW98E"&gt;“We think this is going to be really popular,” Palmer says. “People like to be self reliant. And this makes you completely self reliant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LfhJkOTh-EAAinUkHiA82DeJ2BQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526654/21_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Mi9Cry"&gt;Electric utility, future tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EZDMom"&gt;Speaking of that front trunk, it’s huge. Ford says it can fit two sets of golf clubs or a large suitcase and two carry-on-sized bags. It has a total volume of 14.1 cubic feet (400 liters) and can carry up to 400 pounds of stuff. Like the front trunk on the Mustang Mach-E, it’s water resistant and has a drain for easy cleaning. Ford calls it — seriously — the Mega Power Frunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWX9LB"&gt;The F-150 Lightning’s front trunk is not only large, but the hood takes the truck’s grille with it when it opens, meaning you won’t have to reach up and over to access what’s inside. It’s a considerate touch from Ford, but it’s not terribly surprising considering the myriad utility features the company has built into recent F-150s — many of which carry over to the Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wpc9PV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The frunk is enormous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HhbFI"&gt;Beyond the frunk and the outlets and onboard power, there’s also the fold-out workstation in the center console, which has enough space for a laptop, a pad of paper, or your lunch. For people who spend a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of time in their trucks — while charging, perhaps — the two front seats can fold back pretty much totally flat. And for people who do a lot of towing, the truck has Ford’s new &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36276154/2021-ford-f-150-onboard-scales-announced/"&gt;smart hitch assist feature&lt;/a&gt; that can pretty much automatically hook a trailer up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYmJKf"&gt;In fact, the Lightning shares so much with other F-150s that it’s using the same cab and the same size bed, meaning it should work with previously compatible accessories and add-ons like a slide-in camper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3VY6xOkLI0lauxzMxIMUImAp_3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526655/15_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVKj9c"&gt;One of the biggest differences is that it has a 15.5-inch portrait touchscreen in the more expensive trims. It’s essentially the same as what’s in the Mustang Mach-E, except it doesn’t float over the dashboard. It’s embedded and surrounded by some physical buttons and a few outlets, which Ford says truck customers still rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGgfEY"&gt;That screen is running Ford’s Sync 4A, which is the latest version of the automaker’s  infotainment system that debuted in the Mustang Mach-E. It pretty much operates in a two-pane layout, with the top half often dedicated to navigation or media controls and the bottom half for climate and other vehicle functions. But it also features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto if you’d rather just work with the apps on your phone, or Amazon Alexa if you like to let out the occasional lonely shout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sx9uDV"&gt;The driver display is bigger than the one on the Mustang Mach-E — 12 inches versus 10 inches — and will feature more detailed information about energy usage. This whole system will also be updatable over the air, as Ford recently detailed how it is embracing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22432770/ford-ota-software-update-amazon-alexa"&gt;remote software updates in a big way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LesU-LwCWpCFzA1FjBZSbmI7Y_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526689/24_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9lEB3MTVmyHtvUlfK3yi_yFNIOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526688/23_16X9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RuK2R"&gt;But if you want that 15.5-inch screen, you have to pay for either the Lariat or Platinum trim. The base model Lightning comes with a less flashy landscape-oriented 12-inch capacitive touchscreen that runs the standard version of Sync 4. This version of the truck will still get over-the-air updates, works with CarPlay and Android Auto, and has onboard LTE hotspot capability, so it’s not missing much in the dashboard tech department. In fact, some buyers might prefer the simpler setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPJznQ"&gt;The higher trims of the new F-150 Lightning will also have Ford’s hands-free driver assistance system, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;it calls BlueCruise&lt;/a&gt;, as an option. BlueCruise is slated to launch on equipped 2021 F-150s and Mustang Mach-Es later this year and allows for hands-free driving on more than 100,000 miles of divided highways. Like GM’s Super Cruise system, it uses an infrared camera to track the driver’s eyes to make sure they’re paying attention to the road and are ready to retake control at any moment. That’s a good feature to have on any vehicle that offers advanced driver assistance, but especially one of this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HN_UKpVuh_7wb_WQkrw6dkoP15I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526696/9_16x9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EsCDsE"&gt;Who’s buying?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ElyKpC"&gt;Ford appears to have checked a lot of boxes with the F-150 Lightning, and you could probably argue that it drew a few extra boxes and checked those, too. Range will be a big question, as it always is with new EVs. But it won’t be the only question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqvOKj"&gt;In fact, when I asked Cox Automotive executive analyst Michelle Krebs about the F-150 Lightning, her first instinct was to rattle off a bunch of questions that couldn’t possibly be answered Wednesday night or really until next year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rSwx2C"&gt;Is there a market? We think there is, as when we survey people, there is some interest. But how many of those people are there? Are these traditional truck buyers who are willing to go electric, or are these people who maybe haven’t purchased a truck before but are interested in a truck now that electric is an option? Who are the buyers? We know that EV buyers, generally, are younger than the general car-buying public and far more affluent – among the most affluent of car buyers. Who will these EV truck buyers purchase from – a traditional truck maker, like Ford, with decades of expertise in truck making, or an upstart like Tesla, Rivian, etc.? What will they use their EV trucks for? Our studies show full-size truck buyers tend to use their trucks for work; buyers of smaller trucks use them more for leisure and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ICIEhX"&gt;Those are all great questions. We just won’t know the answers until the F-150 Lightning actually goes on sale in 2022, despite Ford finally showing off what the truck is capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKelus"&gt;Still, it clearly has the potential to be a very big deal. The Mustang Mach-E is already drawing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;a ton of new customers into Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s a far more polarizing vehicle than what Ford unveiled Wednesday night. Ford’s gas-guzzling F-Series trucks are already supremely popular. So if Americans are ever going to consider switching to electric vehicles en masse, an electric F-150 seems as good a bet as any other option — maybe better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzeG0R"&gt;Either way, the F-150 Lightning feels like strange, almost cosmic course correction, as Ford made mass-market combustion-engine automobiles possible way back in the early 20th century, and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/06/henry-ford-thomas-edison-ev/"&gt;crushed the earliest efforts at electric vehicles in the process&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps now, with this new electric truck, it can help tip the balance in the other direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c863R7"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ford F150 Electric|102099" data-volume-uuid="0fa4f5fdb" data-volume-id="102099" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-701" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4paKXr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0heKcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new Zenbook 13 offers an OLED display for a previously unthinkable $800 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75uw7JOCwWoiwhSq3ULsiBqdFms=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314537/asus_zenbook_oled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kOmFMu"&gt;If you told me you’d found an OLED laptop for just $800, I’d have warned you against refurbished computers and deep-discount closeout sales. The inky blackness and gorgeous colors of OLED &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761153/hp-spectre-x360-15-amoled-oled-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;come cheap&lt;/a&gt;. Dell charges &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22369101/dell-xps-13-oled-price-specs-release-date"&gt;a $300 premium&lt;/a&gt; just for the screen. And yet Asus’s new affordable OLED laptop defies those expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7WMzK"&gt;The new machine is called the Asus ZenBook 13 OLED, and &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-13-um325"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/asus-zenbook-13-oled-um32-review/"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; are already suggesting it could be a slam dunk for budget buyers. While there’s no headphone jack and some are complaining &lt;a href="https://www.ultrabookreview.com/45028-asus-zenbook-13-um325-review/"&gt;about a cramped keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the 2.5-pound laptop doesn’t seem to skimp on the specs. In addition to that 13-inch 1080p OLED screen (one of the first 1080p OLEDs I can recall on a laptop) with its 100-percent DCI-P3 color gamut, you can configure it with up to Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 processors, 16GB of storage and 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBc7E9dt5pAkx0Ykcz8DjjN0zXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527011/ports_zenbook_13_oled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intel model replaces these USB-C ports with visually identical Thunderbolt 4 ports instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PpG9MP"&gt;Even at the $800 starting price, you get your pick of an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U or an 11th-gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, a backlit keyboard, a Windows Hello ready IR camera, full-size HDMI 2.0 and USB-A ports, a pair of USB-C ports, and a microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ith1G6"&gt;There’s a few important differences between the Intel and AMD models, though, according to the company’s spec sheets: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EnpwbQ"&gt;Intel starts with a measly 256GB of storage at the $800 mark instead of 512GB for AMD &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UhRTXn"&gt;The company quotes three additional hours of battery life for the AMD system over Intel (note that both were measured at a fairly dim 150 nits of brightness) from the same 67Wh battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xIqBlQ"&gt;With Intel, you get a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports instead of plain ol’ USB 3.2 Type-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BVutln"&gt;AMD models only have Wi-Fi 5, while Intel ones get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/11/21060167/wifi-6-ces-2020-mesh-routers-laptops-6e-5g"&gt;Wi-Fi 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0XtA"&gt;As far as I can tell, retailers like Amazon and Newegg quietly put the laptops on sale earlier this month, though the $800 AMD variant doesn’t seem to be shipping quite yet. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Quad-Core-i5-9300H-Keyboard-Included/dp/B082L4GNRB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $900 Intel model at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpine-gray-asus-zenbook-um325ua-ds51-mainstream%2Fp%2FN82E16834235625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$800 AMD model at Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole array of the new laptops &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/search?q=zenbook%2013%20oled&amp;amp;sort=uitox_price&amp;amp;asc=1&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;s_c=1"&gt;at Asus’s own store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLk7gE"&gt;If you’re looking for a 2-in-1 convertible, Asus is sticking its affordable OLED screen in those too, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenBook-Convertible-Display-Platform/dp/B08KH8QHFM/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=oled+zenbook&amp;amp;qid=1621468088&amp;amp;s=pc&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $950&lt;/a&gt;, though Intel appears to be your only CPU option there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlahcT"&gt;We’d heard screen manufacturers were finally going to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;mass produce laptop-sized OLED panels this year&lt;/a&gt; — perhaps Asus’ laptops are just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details how interconnected Matter smart home standard will work on Android and Nest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PpxyZ6hvbF9tkiAXpSzouE8INSA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314307/dseifert_201115_4301_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktce48"&gt;Google is one of the major companies behind the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;interconnected cross-platform smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, and today, the company has explained how it’ll work to support Matter with its Android devices and Nest smart home products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqT0Q6"&gt;To start, the company is promising that all of its Nest displays and speakers will be updated to enable them to control Matter devices. That means once the update arrives (Google isn’t giving a timeframe yet), you’ll be able to use Google Assistant to control any Matter device, whether it was previously part of Google’s smart home platform or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfqk07"&gt;Additionally, newer Google smart home products with Thread built in, like the Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub Max, and second-gen Nest Hub, will also serve as Matter connection hubs. That will make it easier to set up and use Matter-branded smart home products throughout your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sc6m3B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nest Thermostat review: more simple than smart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KVlGFc"&gt;And in what might be the biggest piece of news: Google is promising that it’ll update the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;latest Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; to support Matter, meaning users will be able to — in theory — control their A/C and heat setups with other Matter-certified platforms (like Siri or Alexa, pending Apple and Amazon’s own updates). Disappointingly, Google is only making that promise for the entry-level Nest Thermostat, not the more powerful Nest Learning Thermostat (at least for now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYSwOu"&gt;Google’s support for Matter is also coming to Android phones. The company promises that it’ll add built-in support for Matter, making it easy to set up and control Matter-enabled smart home gadgets through Android apps, Google Assistant, the Google Home app, and more with “just a few taps.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqREl"&gt;As part of that support, Thread-enabled Matter devices — like Nanoleaf’s Essentials Bulb — will be supported on Android, which could open up a wave of new smart home devices based on the local connectivity standard to Google (and other smart home platforms). Right now, there are still products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;Eve’s HomeKit-exclusive lineup&lt;/a&gt; that rely on Thread but can’t be used with Android devices at all. Matter could potentially change that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no839k"&gt;If everything works as well as promised (again, there’s plenty of software updates and agreements that will still have to be followed through), Matter could be the magical solution for smart home owners: a set of devices that is easy to set up and use with any (or all) smart home software setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLFXnZ"&gt;In addition to Matter details, Google is also announcing a new &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/smart-home?utm_source=blog.google&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=products_assistant_io-2021-smarter-smart-home"&gt;Google smart home directory&lt;/a&gt;, which will include a list of Assistant-compatible products, Q&amp;amp;As, educational videos, and reviews. Lastly, the company also announced that it will add Nest cameras to its automated routines, allowing owners to automatically toggle on (or off) their cameras when they’re coming and going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Zelda Amiibo removes tedium for an extra $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/poJbb5nQvk4HQzrCAETclAd5ddQ=/45x0:549x336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314163/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_3.22.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="04yJy6"&gt;Nintendo is releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;the HD remake of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the Switch on July 16th, and in the run up to the return of the — checks &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Historia — &lt;/em&gt;current earliest entry in the Zelda timeline, it’s also selling a new amiibo. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/new-zelda-and-loftwing-amiibo-figure-launches-alongside-the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-on-july-16/"&gt;The $25 “Zelda and Loftwing”&lt;/a&gt; NFC-equipped figurine features the proto-princess and her bird companion, but also comes with the unique ability to teleport to the game’s floating hub world from anywhere, bypassing one of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;’s many annoying quirks for an extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGWcFC"&gt;Fast travel in &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; is normally only accessible at in-game save points, a remnant of the more rigid Zelda design the game launched with on the Wii in 2011. When this new amiibo is placed on the Switch in the HD remake, you can automatically return to the sky to restock on items or upgrade something, and then return to wherever you were without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWSAQl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the new Zelda &amp;amp; Loftwing amiibo, launching on 7/16! This amiibo features two characters on a single base and can be used to travel between the surface and the sky in The Legend of Zelda: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SkywardSwordHD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SkywardSwordHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://t.co/mbhwOfSzX5"&gt;https://t.co/mbhwOfSzX5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YFK5WbYYHZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YFK5WbYYHZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1394824252600295426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpVWYw"&gt;For comparison, the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; amiibo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15041136/nintendo-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-collectibles"&gt;unlocked exclusive weapons, armor, and health items&lt;/a&gt; in the game rather than adding new gameplay functionality. Exclusive armor is one thing, but it’s even more frustrating to lock a quality-of-life feature behind the purchase of a plastic collectible. Nintendo is already doing some things to sand down the harder edges of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; to make it work better on the Switch, like offering sword combat with the thumbstick rather than just motion controls. Why not do the same thing with a more user-friendly fast travel system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVODfC"&gt;There are potential ways to avoid plopping down around $85 for the ideal version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re willing to wade into the murkier waters of emulation, we’ve experimented with ways to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15223338/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-amiibo-hacking-ethics"&gt;create a homemade amiibo&lt;/a&gt; with an RFID toaster and some NFC tags. It’s a natural reaction to amiibo selling out fast, and Nintendo tying more and more attractive, and in this case, useful features to them. If this new Zelda amiibo proves as popular as the recent paper &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22352196/acnh-sanrio-hello-kitty-amiibo-cards-target-sold-out-scalpers-resell-buy-new-horizons-switch"&gt;amiibo cards for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have, it could become a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4yjE4"&gt;The “Zelda and Loftwing” amiibo will be released on July 16th for $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five more women are suing Amazon for discrimination and retaliation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaMcp5eSlUlqVP9ZCyDQn1PBw1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314106/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUFPIU"&gt;Five female Amazon employees filed discrimination lawsuits against the company Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/19/22444177/amazon-five-more-lawsuits-employees-allege-race-and-gender-discrimination-charlotte-newman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The women worked at vastly different areas of the business, ranging from a warehouse to corporate HR. All say they were retaliated against by white managers after bringing forward complaints of racial discrimination, sexism, or sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpVQwP"&gt;One of the plaintiffs, a 64-year-old Black woman named Pearl Thomas, said she was placed on a performance improvement plan after complaining about her boss’s racist remarks. Thomas, who worked in HR, claimed her boss used the “n-word” in reference to her, and told her and another Black colleague “you don’t want to be an angry Black woman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qEiTJE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He allegedly made comments like “Latins suck,” and “How is a Latin like you working here?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Owtb7G"&gt;Diana Cuervo, a 40-year-old Latina warehouse manager, said she was fired after reporting her white boss for racism. He allegedly made comments like “Latins suck,” and “How is a Latin like you working here?” in front of her, according to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITGR0U"&gt;Three of the women still work at Amazon. Two have left the company. Their cases are all being brought by Wigdor LLP, the law firm representing Charlotte Newman — &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/1/22306508/amazon-race-discrimination-sexual-harassment-assault-lawsuit-charlotte-newman"&gt;a Black Amazon manager who is also suing the company for race and gender discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMgpBa"&gt;“Women and employees of color at all levels of Amazon have had their complaints of harassment and discrimination brushed under the rug,” said Wigdor LLP partners Lawrence M. Pearson and Jeanne M. Christensen in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;. “Amazon can no longer dismiss abusive behavior and retaliation by white managers as mere anecdotes. These are systemic problems, entrenched deep within the company and perpetuated by a human resources organization that treats employees who raise concerns as a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7LxB"&gt;The lawsuits follow similar allegations of gender discrimination and bias at companies such as Pinterest and Google. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;Pinterest settled a lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Brougher said she was fired after complaining about sexism and unequal pay. Timnit Gebru, a prominent Black AI ethics researcher, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;was fired from Google in December&lt;/a&gt; while writing a paper about the dangers of large language models. She has publicly accused the company of racism, gaslighting, and retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cw0YnS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Amazon spokesperson denied any claims of wrongdoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j0iiWU"&gt;On May 26th, Amazon shareholders will &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-investors-urged-by-proxy-firm-to-vote-in-favor-of-racial-audit/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%20State%20Common,those%20issues%20affect%20Amazon's%20business.&amp;amp;text=Amazon%20is%20asking%20shareholders%20to%20reject%20the%20proposal."&gt;vote on a proposal from the New York State Common Retirement Fund&lt;/a&gt; calling for an independent audit into how the company’s civil rights, equity, and diversity and inclusion policies impact the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGNHVd"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon spokesperson denied any claims of wrongdoing. “We are conducting thorough investigations for each of these unrelated cases, as we do with any reported incidents, and we have found no evidence to support the allegations,” they said. “We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form, and employees are encouraged to raise concerns to any member of management or through an anonymous ethics hotline with no risk of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack will let you list your pronouns right under your job title</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLHMivyZVm5-d30CMCpMkIc55Ws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314094/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="szxV4s"&gt;Slack is now rolling out a new field for profiles that will let you list your pronouns right under your name and job title. Once filled out, your pronouns will appear both on the mini-profiles you see when you click on someone’s name and in their full profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HASRc0"&gt;Note that your Slack profile may already have a pronouns field, if an administrator created a custom field for your company’s employees. (When I went to check &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Slack, I found we already had one.) Slack says administrators can continue using that custom field or choose to turn on this new one, though the new dedicated pronouns field has the benefit of appearing more prominently in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YI5ucKyoNhPCA_qNraXhbg7LLrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526743/Slack_pronouns_feature.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Slack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how your pronouns will appear in Slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YVfP3p"&gt;This new field will be hidden by default, however — Slack administrators will have to flip it on for everyone in a Slack workspace. If you’re an administrator and want to do that, &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500011115781-Manage-pronoun-display-for-member-profiles"&gt;here’s a quick guide from Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut3OBE"&gt;Slack joins a few other apps in letting people add pronouns to profiles, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431055/instagram-pronoun-profile-update-setting"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (which just got them last week), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17846054/okcupid-pronoun-options"&gt;OkCupid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18646740/lyft-pronoun-choice-app-lgbtq-pride"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says its image crops weren’t very biased, but is phasing them out anyhow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZ4lAOE3Foiq73pgWUiyibepiJE=/182x0:1142x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69313861/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_12.37.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Yee, Tantipongpipat, Mishra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xgPOSi"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;is phasing out its image cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in favor of showing larger previews, and &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/sharing-learnings-about-our-image-cropping-algorithm.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s been looking into accusations that the system was biased. It found that the crops were slightly biased towards certain races and genders, but Twitter’s main gripe seems to be that the algorithm doesn’t give users control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiKM3w"&gt;Starting in 2018, Twitter started using the algorithm to crop images so they fit in its image preview boxes. The algorithm tries to determine what will be most visually interesting to a user so it can include it can include it in the preview, but some have accused it of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;favoring white faces over black ones&lt;/a&gt;. To determine if that’s the case, Twitter had some of its researchers &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf"&gt;produce a report&lt;/a&gt; analyzing the choices it makes when determining crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cTpfha"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How to crop an image is a decision best made by people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JpTkS"&gt;When testing to see if the algorithm indeed had racial biases, the researchers’ found that the algorithm chose to crop to white women over black women 7 percent of the time, and white men over black men 2 percent of the time, with an overall 4 percent preference for white individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owUeJz"&gt;Twitter also tested for gender bias, trying to see if the algorithm chose to crop around men more than women, and if it cropped pictures of women inappropriately (read: cropping around a woman’s chest or legs, rather than her face). It found that the algorithm favored women 8 percent of the time, but didn’t seem to crop them in a perv-y manner: in the approximately 3 percent of cases where it didn’t crop to a woman’s face, it was focused on things like a sports jersey’s number.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDpmnRo-GrPBNgsTYJBafpyeZK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526431/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_1.28.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Yee, Tantipongpipat, Mishra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the report showing a correct and incorrect crop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4jfq2y"&gt;Twitter admits that the algorithms could still be harmful in other ways it hasn’t tested, and that relying on machine learning to crop images takes a lot of agency away from users. The company said draws the conclusion “that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvTTKE"&gt;To let people make that decision, Twitter has made the image previews bigger in its iOS and Android apps, so the algorithm doesn’t have to make as many cropping decisions. When it does need to crop an image, like if the image is very tall or wide, the user will be shown a preview of what it will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0faVz"&gt;The cropping algorithm hasn’t fully gone away, especially in the case of Twitter for the web where image preview crops still abound, but Twitter seems to hope that in most cases machine learning will take a back seat to human intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is getting a trilogy of Fear Street movies in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fear Street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ML2lo_DkCCucTWlLmqogYI94g6A=/364x0:2634x1513/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69313525/Fear_Street.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fbmk8N"&gt;The ’90s are back in Netflix’s latest horror movies. A trilogy of movies based on R.L. Stine’s classic &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; book series is coming to the streaming service in July. Plan your spooky movie nights accordingly: part one will debut on July 2nd, followed by sequels on the 9th and 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spdn87"&gt;Here’s the basic premise, according to Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TAQVDi"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. Based on  R.L. Stine’s best selling horror series, the trilogy follows the nightmare through Shadyside’s sinister history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DA0BKv"&gt;Each film will cover a different time period. The first will take place in 1994, while the sequels will explore 1978 and — of course — 1666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RNkx3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; books originally debuted back in 1989 and served as a more teenage-oriented counterpart to the blockbuster and hugely influential &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps&lt;/em&gt; series, which helped make Stine a household name. Back in 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9519805/goosebumps-rl-stine-interview"&gt;Stine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “I never wanted to be scary, either. I only wanted to be funny.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces a slew of accessibility updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person’s wrist showing an Apple Watch. On the screen of the Watch is an option to end a run, highlighted with a small cursor hovering over it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWKaurK8b9bqtr9jfqXcQwibWgI=/100x0:880x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312971/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_2.42.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch with the Assistive Touch cursor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3hyNc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a variety of new and updated features for people with disabilities today. Beginning May 20th, customers can use the new SignTime sign language interpreter service to contact AppleCare and retail customer care through their web browsers. Software updates later this year to iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS will bring improved options for Assistive Touch, VoiceOver, hearing aid support, and background sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inBvEa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe everyone should have the tools they need to change the world. Accessibility is a fundamental right, and we’re always pushing the boundaries of innovation so that everyone can learn, create and connect in new ways. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GAAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x"&gt;https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1395074896791674885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzzyD6"&gt;The new SignTime service is launching first in the US, UK, and France, and offers remote interpreter access for American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. People can also use the service in Apple stores to get interpretation without booking it in advance, potentially preventing the hassle of wrangling an interpreter on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GElgH8"&gt;People with limb differences will be able to use Assistive Touch on watchOS, which should enable them to use Apple Watch without touching the screen. (Apple did not verify which Watches this will work for.) Apple says the Apple Watch can detect muscle movement and tendon activity through its built-in sensors, allowing users to control a cursor on the watch screen, answer calls, access notifications, and more by making various movements and gestures. (You can see it in action in the video &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg8fFG"&gt;iPadOS will support third-party eye-tracking devices, allowing people with low mobility to move a cursor with their gaze and perform actions by holding eye contact, rather than tapping the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGGMmo"&gt;VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, will be updated to include more details in images. According to Apple, it will allow people to navigate images with text and data tables by rows and columns, and describe people and objects in images. People will also be able to add image descriptions with Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OSdE9"&gt;Apple plans to upgrade the Made for iPhone hearing devices program, too, with support for bidirectional hearing aids. Users will also be able to upload their hearing test results to Headphone Accommodations to more easily customize how the feature amplifies sounds and adjusts different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three smiling Memojis, showing one with a cochlear implant on the left, one with nasal oxygen tubes in the center, and one with a soft helmet on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xafYxYSX8o60kVdNupxHnTZbpls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526096/apple_gaad21_new_memoji_05192021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/e1e4026d-01e3-40da-bea5-aee0f1e19a09" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UCeQKs"&gt;For neurodiverse people (or anyone who likes white noise), Apple is introducing Background Sounds that can be incorporated with other audio and system sounds. They include “balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds” that can be set to play continuously and mask distracting or overwhelming noises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emW7wY"&gt;Other features Apple is planning for later in the year include the ability to use mouth sounds like clicks or pops instead of using physical buttons, the customization of display and text size settings in individual apps, and new Memoji options with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKugC"&gt;Companies large and small always have room for improvement when it comes to making their products accessible, but Apple has generally been a leader in the space. These updates hopefully signal a continued commitment to designing with disabled people in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDofnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qKNPY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
