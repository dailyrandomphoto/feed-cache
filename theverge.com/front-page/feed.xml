    <title>Zoom filter traps this lawyer as a cute cat during live court hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdjLUe_1WodERpelQ2qpDa-PRUw=/101x0:1172x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68794194/Screenshot_2021_02_09_141313.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHkm89"&gt;As Rod Ponton awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed during a live Zoom hearing into an adorable pet feline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZYkuV"&gt;Such is the fate of some lawyers and video call participants in the coronavirus era who may struggle with some of the more powerful tools offered by platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. Thankfully, we have Ponton’s remarkable transformation on camera, as part of a live streamed hearing of the 394th Judicial District Court &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlPGPupdd8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;now available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It was also publicly tweeted by Judge Roy Ferguson, who presides over the district encompassing a handful of small West Texas counties near the Mexico border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQfeYZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT ZOOM TIP:  If a child used your computer, before you join a virtual hearing check the Zoom Video Options to be sure filters are off. This kitten just made a formal announcement on a case in the 394th (sound on). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lawtwitter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#lawtwitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OhNo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OhNo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@zoom_us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/I0zaj0wu6K"&gt;https://t.co/I0zaj0wu6K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Judge Roy Ferguson (@JudgeFergusonTX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudgeFergusonTX/status/1359202090824966151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qT02oK"&gt;It’s frustrating to have to deal with this type of technology on a near-daily basis these days — even the most seasoned video callers can find themselves befuddled by waiting rooms, cell limits, and screen sharing. But in this case, the confusion and horror felt more real and immediate. At times, it even sounds as if Ponton might have actually become a cat, if you were to go by the sounds of real distress in his voice and the alarming level of realism in the filter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBO0M0"&gt;As to where this particular filter comes from, I’m not sure as I was unable to locate it in Zoom’s default filter pack and a cursory search of the Snap Camera filter directory didn’t pull it up either. (Zoom does allow for third-party filters to be used during calls.) &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpmgp/i-am-not-a-cat-lawyer-using-zoom-cat-filter-tells-judge"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which spoke with Ponton on Monday, it was his secretary’s computer, and after figuring out how to turn the filter off the hearing proceeded without incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r23UMI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“I’m here live, I’m not a cat,” says lawyer after Zoom filter mishap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I can see that,” responds judge &lt;a href="https://t.co/HclKlAUwbM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HclKlAUwbM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lawrence Hurley (@lawrencehurley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lawrencehurley/status/1359207169091108864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZ5sRa"&gt;Still, it’s undeniable adorable and a little heartwarming, too, as a grown adult finds themselves embodying a cute animal with saucer-shaped green eyes. At one point, Ponton suggests the trio of participants “go forward with it” as he can’t figure out how to turn the filter off, adding, “I’m here live, I’m not a cat.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWrP8h"&gt;To which fellow lawyer H. Gibbs Bauer responds, “I can see that,” all while lawyer Jerry L. Philips gleefully grins in the upper righthand corner. Truly a Zoom interaction for the ages, and a cautionary tale for any professionals out there who are less dutiful about checking their settings before jumping straight into a work meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder has revealed a new version of Jared Leto’s Joker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QTAJUtri5pst-bnJP1tAVkDQ4w=/301x462:1318x1140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68794181/Joker_first_look_embed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vanity Fair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ta6zWk"&gt;The Joker is such an elemental comic book villain that any new version is bound to be compared to previous iterations. It’s rare, then, that an actor would get to play two versions of the character in the span of a few years, but such is the blessed life of one Jared Leto. As part of the run-up to the release of &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, the director has revealed the first images of &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/jared-leto-joker-justice-league-zack-snyder"&gt;the new version of Leto’s take on the Clown Prince of Crime&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;. The results are more than a little gloomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBbLeS"&gt;You might remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/24/8494935/jared-leto-joker-suicide-squad-first-look"&gt;the original Leto Joker for his tattoos&lt;/a&gt; — in particular, the delicately printed “damaged” on his forehead or the variety of “hahahahahas” on his body. That version of the character from &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad was&lt;/em&gt; an edgy, annoying boyfriend to Harley Quinn, but he’s grown up a bit in Snyder’s new / old film, seemingly losing his iconic tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="21xJS6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10334389"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UUx0Wl"&gt;The new version of the character features longer hair and more aggressive makeup (maybe that’s what’s covering the tattoos?), and Leto also seems to have ditched the over-the-top wardrobe in favor of some kind of hospital gown, face mask, and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M35oM1NLL97byQJiHLiAiXECJEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292607/Joker_first_look_embed.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vanity Fair&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zack Snyder’s Justice League version of Jared Leto’s Joker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ2OU6"&gt;A more “adult” take on DC characters is sort of Snyder’s MO, but grounded versions of the Joker have also proved popular recently. The entirely separate film continuity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899422/joker-movie-review-todd-phillips-joaquin-phoenix-incel-violence-dc-comics-batman"&gt;Todd Phillip’s &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ended up being so well-received that it was nominated for a slew of awards at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Joaquin Phoenix winning Best Actor for his portrayal of the character. The new Leto Joker could very well be carrying some of that “seriousness” forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NwrAe"&gt;The inclusion of the Joker was announced last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527437/jared-leto-joker-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;as one of Snyder’s new additions&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; director’s cut. The director has now revealed that the character will appear in a very specific, apocalyptic section of the film, according to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIElTX"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bg91rj"&gt;Joker appears in the new film during a sequence set on a ruined Earth after the alien tyrant Darkseid invades and decimates the planet. It’s a dream sequence, a psychic vision, experienced by Ben Affleck’s Bruce Wayne that reveals what will happen if the superheroes fail to stop the onslaught. Joker is sort of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, supplying motivation through terror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q7aQNP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255990/justice-league-snyder-cut-hbo-max-release-date"&gt;will be released on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 10 comes to the Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Gjxh4ebsZxI86huyiAfxuDK2io=/0x107:640x534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68794099/Nintendo_Switch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cJshlV"&gt;The same people who originally brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/29/20746304/android-nintendo-switch-nvidia-shield"&gt;Android to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the Switchroot team, are back with an Android 10 update, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lineageos-17-1-nintendo-switch-android-tv-10-joy-con-support/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the mod is only available for certain Switch models, it allows users who install it to run apps from the Google Play Store, like games, emulators, and streaming services like Netflix and Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR588Y"&gt;The update also brings some more polish to the mod, letting the Joy-Con sticks work as proper analog sticks instead of eight-way D-pads, deep sleep support that the devs say “can last for weeks,” over-the-air updates, and better Wi-Fi support that promises fewer disconnections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6inAi"&gt;Of course, the real reason for adding Android to a Switch is so you can play games that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; Switch games, likes the ones made playable by the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP emulators on the Play Store. You can see how those perform on the Switch in the video below. Of course, you can also get other Play Store games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; or apps like Spotify. But you’re also not giving up the ability to play Switch games, as Android is installed on a microSD card instead of being flashed to the console itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IcsqbP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOWYexeKd6A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ss5VY6"&gt;It’s worth noting that Android on the Switch is extraordinarily unofficial. The LineageOS team isn’t officially supporting the port, and it’s more or less a modified build of the OS that was meant for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;. The exploit to get Android running also only works on Switches that came out &lt;a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/is-the-new-switch-hardware-revision-worth-buying.543852/"&gt;before Nintendo’s chipset and battery upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, which completely excludes the Switch Lite. Even if you own one of the moddable Switches, which you can check &lt;a href="https://ismyswitchpatched.com"&gt;with an online tool&lt;/a&gt;, some of the guides on how to get into the Android bootloader say &lt;a href="https://noirscape.github.io/RCM-Guide/#metal_bridge"&gt;it’s possible to brick your Switch&lt;/a&gt; if you make a mistake. Extreme caution is advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjKKdh"&gt;There are also caveats, like the fact that the games built for the Nvidia Shield don't work, &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-switchroot-android-10.4229761/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; that acts as a guide on how to install the mod. However, the list of bummers is way smaller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/29/20746304/android-nintendo-switch-nvidia-shield"&gt;than it was last time&lt;/a&gt; when the version of Android was LineageOS 15.1, which was based on Android 8.1 Oreo. The new version is based on LineageOS 17.1, which is a build of Android 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQfJxe"&gt;It’s nice to see this Switch mod get some love and become improved over the years. The changelog below includes a solid number of updates, so it’s worth checking out if you’re running a previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="d2yJDY"&gt;* Android 10 based on Lineage 17.1&lt;br&gt;* OTA updates.&lt;br&gt;* Full Joy-Con and Pro Controller support with analog sticks and rails.&lt;br&gt;* Hori Joy-Con support.&lt;br&gt;* Deep sleep that can last for weeks.&lt;br&gt;* An Android TV based build.&lt;br&gt;* Reworked fan profiles for quieter operation.&lt;br&gt;* Optimised dock support with resolution scaling.&lt;br&gt;* A rewritten charger driver supporting USB-PD and third party docks.&lt;br&gt;* Optimised touch screen driver.&lt;br&gt;* Easier install via hekate partition tool.&lt;br&gt;* Reworked, simpler, power profiles.&lt;br&gt;* Much improved WiFi driver with less dropouts.&lt;br&gt;* Shield TV remote app support for easy docked control.&lt;br&gt;* Reboot to payload support.&lt;br&gt;* Improved Bluetooth accessory support.&lt;br&gt;* Auto rotation support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Audi reveals its Porsche-powered E-Tron GT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBZKB48_UdWyu-R-usTxKmd3QxQ=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793786/A210286_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Starting at a cool $100,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2r1w9C"&gt;Audi has announced the E-Tron GT, an expensive new high-performance electric sedan built on technology developed for Porsche’s first EV, the Taycan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4M2C0"&gt;Due out this spring in Europe, the E-Tron GT will start at €99,800 with a top-spec RS version starting at €138,200. It will then come stateside in the summer, with the base GT starting at $99,900 and the RS beginning at $139,900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hJbFr"&gt;For all of that money, buyers will get the most performance that Audi has squeezed out of an electric car to date. The standard E-Tron GT can output 350kW of power, or roughly 470 horsepower, while the RS version boasts 440kW, or about 590 horsepower. In overboost mode, those numbers jump to 522 horsepower and 637 horsepower, respectively. With overboost and launch control, the E-Tron GT can sprint to 100 kilometers per hour in 4.1 seconds, and the RS version makes that run in 3.3 seconds. Not bad for a car that weighs &lt;em&gt;about 5,100 pounds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8sDkce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Audi promises “more than” 488 kilometers / 298 miles of range as a best case scenario&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="srB5kt"&gt;Both models achieve that performance with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup that’s powered by a 93kWh battery pack (with 85kWh of usable energy). The battery pack uses 800-volt technology, too, which not only lets the GT perform at high levels but will also enable faster charging. Audi says just five minutes will recover 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, of range when hooked up to a high-speed charging network like Volkswagen’s Electrify America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLV2YhrCmv-mEEIvVybe1VgXCo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292411/A210283_large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Audi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2flS2A"&gt;If those numbers sound familiar, it’s because it’s the exact same setup as the Porsche Taycan. That was the plan from the jump when the GT was first revealed as a concept car &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18116978/audi-e-tron-gt-concept-porsche-electric-car-sedan-590-horsepower"&gt;at the 2018 LA Auto Show&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/heres-why-the-electric-audi-e-tron-gt-in-avengers-endg-1834423004"&gt;made an appearance in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Much like how the larger Volkswagen Group will share the German &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316580/audi-q4-etron-sportback-suv-2021-volkswagen-meb"&gt;automaker’s mass-market MEB electric car platform&lt;/a&gt;, the powertrain that was developed for Porsche’s first EV was made available to Audi for the GT, which will exist as a halo vehicle of its all-electric E-Tron brand. (To wit, it will even be built on the same assembly line as the R8 sports car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1aF6d"&gt;Audi says the base E-Tron GT should get “more than 488km” (or 298 miles) of range on a full charge, though that’s according to the European WLTP testing standard. In its US press release, Audi cites a 238-mile range for the standard GT and a 232-mile range for the RS, though those are not official EPA range estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRXbEM"&gt;Despite being such a pricey car, the base E-Tron GT’s price tag will climb even higher for buyers who want the German automaker’s most advanced tech. Audi’s Matrix LED headlights, which have a &lt;a href="https://media.audiusa.com/en-us/releases/444"&gt;complex mirror system that can shape the light in highly specific ways&lt;/a&gt;, are an option (though only in Europe). There’s also an optional heads-up display that can project information onto the windshield. All-wheel steering is available, but only as an option. Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen sound system? Optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oh8wQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blistering performance with a steep price tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ke5BU"&gt;The more expensive RS model includes some of these features, though its price can also jump depending on which wheels are fitted or if the buyer opts for a carbon-fiber reinforced roof over the standard glass option. Noise-insulating glass on the side and rear windows are also an option, as are massage seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYcHUG"&gt;Both E-Tron GTs come fitted with two displays — a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch touchscreen — that are powered by the latest version of Audi’s infotainment system. That means there’s an LTE Advanced chip for onboard Wi-Fi connectivity, navigation powered by Here maps, a companion smartphone app for controlling door locks and other functions, and wireless CarPlay and Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkLIJp"&gt;In total, the E-Tron GT is the most loaded up electric Audi to date. It’s the kind of thing that could properly compete (in some respects) with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;Tesla’s new refreshed Model S&lt;/a&gt;, and it gives deep-pocketed customers the option of Porsche Taycan-level performance in a different package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eOs3cn"&gt;Audi has already shipped tens of thousands of E-Tron SUVs and Sportbacks, its first electric models released in the wake of the Volkswagen Group’s Dieselgate scandal. But the extra capability afforded by Porsche’s technology could help the automaker steal away luxury car buyers who were previously put off by the lacking range of the original E-Tron (or its most direct competition, the Mercedes-Benz EQC). Beyond that, the E-Tron GT will now serve as the standard bearer for Audi’s push into electric vehicles, the car that all other Audi EVs will be measured against as most customers inevitably settle for something more attainable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram says its algorithm won’t promote Reels that have a TikTok watermark</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instagram Reels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhovKHTD0CnxTVsp8dBcXPWWYdg=/79x0:3127x2032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793688/Reels_IOSX_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdGOvy"&gt;Instagram’s newest guidance for creators makes one thing clear: the platform wants people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels. Today, Instagram says it’s making changes to its algorithm and how it recommends Reels to users. Along with that, it’s issuing new best practices on its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/"&gt;@creators account&lt;/a&gt; to give Instagram users tips on how to make content that’s likely to be seen and promoted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaH2Qc"&gt;The team now recommends that Reels users post vertical videos that use music found in Instagram’s library or sounds that they find on Reels. They also suggest “starting a trend” that others can participate in, like dance crazes, as well as “entertaining” and “fun” content. Reels that are mostly covered by text, are blurry, have a watermark or logo, or have a border around it won’t be recommended as frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37g2BC"&gt;“We’re building on what we’ve learned from Explore to recommend fun and entertaining videos in places like the Reels tab, and personalize the experience,” says spokesperson Devi Narasimhan in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “We are getting better at using ranking signals that help us predict whether people will find a reel entertaining and whether we should recommend it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0Nfsd"&gt;Narasimhan says Instagram user surveys demonstrated that people have a “less satisfying” Reels experience when content is recycled from other apps or is blurry, so it’ll start deemphasizing that content in its recommendation software. This makes it less likely to be discovered by people who aren’t following the person who posted it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMhe15"&gt;It’s no surprise these recommendations are coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;six months after Reels&lt;/a&gt; launched in the US. The platform might have been okay with people initially bringing their TikToks over to Instagram, but as it looks to become a popular destination on its own, Instagram needs to make sure Reels isn’t just an advertisement for TikTok, or worse, a place where people just dump whatever content they’ve already made. This might mean more work for creators, however, who will possibly have to shift some of their effort to Reels, rather than focusing  on one platform and then distributing the content everywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei asks court to overturn FCC ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U5bWsMf-AeSdpW3lo3rWgidiOcs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793668/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RqvwRO"&gt;Huawei has &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292499/huawei_review_request.pdf"&gt;asked a court to overturn&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission’s designation of it as a national security threat. The Chinese telecom argues that the FCC overstepped its authority in December 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-affirms-designation-huawei-national-security-threat"&gt;finalizing a ban&lt;/a&gt; supported by former President Donald Trump. “The order on review potentially impacts the financial interests of the telecommunications industry as a whole,” Huawei’s request says, including network operators the FCC locked out of buying Huawei components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtnzdR"&gt;The Biden administration’s FCC reiterated its support for the decision, however. “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous US national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="umcWp3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s Commerce nominee has tentatively supported keeping Huawei banned&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Re3iTO"&gt;Huawei was deemed a threat under Trump, whose administration used a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-future/archives"&gt;variety of methods&lt;/a&gt; to sever its ties to US businesses. Federal agencies argued that Huawei equipment posed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18264283/huawei-security-threat-experts-china-spying-5g"&gt;inexcusable security risk&lt;/a&gt;, citing possible backdoors that would let the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;spy on Americans&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei has denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJMjyi"&gt; In 2019, the FCC voted to bar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977703/fcc-vote-huawei-zte-china-funding-federal-aid"&gt;using federal funds to buy&lt;/a&gt; its products, preventing American companies from rolling out wireless networks with Huawei (or fellow Chinese company ZTE) equipment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;That order took effect&lt;/a&gt; in June of last year, despite &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/huawei-fcc-lawsuit.html"&gt;a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; from Huawei. The FCC went further in December, voting to make companies &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-huawei-zte-telecoms-equipment-184645636.html"&gt;replace existing Huawei equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b32Re"&gt;Trump’s Huawei feud was part of a larger trade war with China, and it was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22174704/2020-tiktok-ban-trump-administration"&gt;unprecedented attempts to ban&lt;/a&gt; popular mobile apps TikTok and WeChat. President Joe Biden has not renewed the war on TikTok, but his administration has indicated that it will continue cracking down on Huawei — despite the wishes of Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;who said he would “welcome”&lt;/a&gt; a call from Biden. Gina Raimondo, Biden’s nominee for Commerce Department secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist"&gt;said she saw&lt;/a&gt; “no reason” to remove it from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371850/trump-huawei-restrictions-china-android-updates"&gt;department’s banned Entity List&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota teams up with Aurora and Denso on robotaxi development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZpUe6uxmXIj5c3D1t3_2H-RYoQ=/0x0:3937x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793640/Aurora_Sienna_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeaCzA"&gt;It’s 2021 and we’re still finding unique ways to pair up to develop self-driving cars. The latest is between Toyota, AV startup Aurora, and auto part supplier Denso. The three companies will join forces to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcH2Md"&gt;It’s a big get for Aurora, the scrappy AV startup founded by Chris Urmson, the former head engineer of Google’s self-driving car project, among others. Toyota, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/toyota-unseats-vw-to-become-the-world-s-top-selling-automaker?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;outsold Volkswagen in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim its status as the biggest automaker in the world, is one of the few car companies that has yet to pair up with an autonomous vehicle startup. Denso, which spun out of Toyota in the mid-20th century, is one of the largest auto suppliers on the planet. So Aurora is now officially rolling with the big dogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04FzGs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aurora is now officially rolling with the big dogs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBXvQ7"&gt;The companies plan to develop and test driverless vehicles equipped with Aurora’s self-driving hardware and software stack, starting with the Toyota Sienna minivan. “By the end of 2021, we expect to have designed, built, and begun testing an initial fleet of these Siennas near our areas of development,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4ct7m"&gt;Once they finish testing, the companies will begin mass producing autonomous vehicles for a full-scale ride-hailing operation. According to Aurora:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CtzDLH"&gt;It brings our companies together to lay the groundwork for the mass-production, launch, and support of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s, over the next few years. As part of this long-term effort, we’ll be exploring mass production of key autonomous driving components with Denso and a comprehensive services solution with Toyota for when these vehicles are deployed at scale, including financing, insurance, maintenance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g3q5ZG"&gt;Aurora recently grew its ranks of engineers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;acquiring Uber’s self-driving car division&lt;/a&gt; late last year. The startup sent offer letters to about three-fourths of the ride-hailing company’s Advanced Technologies Group, which is based in Pittsburgh and Toronto, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUrYXc"&gt;Toyota has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet. The Japanese company has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166854/toyota-self-driving-car-test-vehicle-ces-2019"&gt;some information about its test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;types of sensors&lt;/a&gt; it’s using, but we’ve seen very little of the cars in operation. Toyota was planning to offer a limited ride-hailing pilot in downtown Tokyo during the 2020 Summer Olympics, but that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;recently invested $400 million in Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving startup based in the US and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk44VQ"&gt;Toyota has developed a self-driving software called “Chauffeur,” which ironically was also the codename for Google’s self-driving project under Urmson. Toyota’s software is “focused on full autonomy, where the human is essentially removed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from the driving equation, either completely in all environments, or within a restricted driving domain.” Toyota has a second product called “Guardian,” which is essentially an advanced driver-assist system akin to Tesla’s Autopilot. Neither is being offered in any production car today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UZj2d"&gt;Toyota Research Institute, the automaker’s Silicon Valley-based division, has been conducting tests at its Ottawa Lake, Michigan, closed-course facility for a number of years. In 2018, Toyota agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787878/toyota-uber-investment-self-driving-car-research"&gt;invest $500 million in a joint self-driving project with Uber&lt;/a&gt;, but that investment is now moot as Aurora owns what’s left of Uber’s AV division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOReqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2tikg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMS3l3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obcIjS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream the second Trump impeachment trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Democratic Leadership Speaks To Media Ahead Of Impeachment Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1kBU89RDrh7UUUkhcYsxlBfpWY=/0x0:5678x3785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793523/1231062522.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SI9Qqx"&gt;The second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump begins today. Trump was charged with incitement of insurrection by the House after the attack on the Capitol last month. House impeachment managers and Trump’s legal team will debate the constitutionality of the case today. After a Senate vote, which will likely pass, both sides will begin opening arguments on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xpF9Za"&gt;What time does the impeachment start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tzbN7R"&gt;The first day of the trial begins at 1PM ET. There will be four hours for both sides to present arguments. The House has already voted to bring an article of impeachment against Trump, so the Senate arguments will be over whether the misconduct is sufficient to justify penalties, including potentially barring Trump from holding federal office in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u9QsML"&gt;How long will the trial last?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TLCk9w"&gt;After the Senate vote passes, both sides will have 16 hours over two days to make their case, per &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/537876-schumer-mcconnell-reach-deal-on-trump-impeachment-trial"&gt;a deal reached by the Senate&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. If neither side calls witnesses, the trial could be over by early next week. However, there is significant pressure on Democrats to call witnesses in order to heighten the political impact of the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leyKZU"&gt;Where can you watch the impeachment proceedings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NHIdDo"&gt;There will be a &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?508293-1/impeachment-trial"&gt;C-SPAN stream&lt;/a&gt; starting at 12:55PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeZdTU"&gt;Live coverage will also be streamed by networks including &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/live"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trumps-second-impeachment-trial-begins-in-senate"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fi VPN is coming to iPhones this spring</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUjLLc"&gt;Google launched a VPN for its Google Fi cell service in beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;back in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Fi subscribers to route their phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to help protect security and privacy. Until now, though, it has only been available for Android users, but that will change soon. Google plans to roll out the Fi VPN to Fi subscribers on iPhones beginning this spring, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-vpn-updates-help-you-connect-safely/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTUrSs"&gt;Google also announced that the VPN is officially exiting beta on Android. “After listening to your feedback and making performance improvements, we’re taking the Fi VPN out of beta for Android phone users,” Google said. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans, so you should be able to try it out now if you’re a Fi subscriber on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x45ass"&gt;In addition, Google says it’s starting to roll out a new privacy and security hub for Fi users on Android. “The hub makes it easy for you to learn more about privacy and security features on Fi, and manage them with just one tap,” according to Google. “This includes the Fi VPN and other tools that protect your personal information and put you in control of who can reach you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021 was the most-streamed NFL game ever</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkSEp5"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will go down in history for a few things, including being the most-streamed NFL game ever, but it had the lowest numbers in over a decade in terms of viewership. CBS Sports reports that this year’s NFL championship drew in a total audience of 96.5 million viewers, with streaming in particular up by 65 percent compared to last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUTrfS"&gt;Yet, despite a global pandemic and a ton of ways to stream the game, the numbers were still low. As &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/super-bowl-liii-100-7-million-viewers-ratings-down/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s Super Bowl drew 102 million viewers, meaning that this year’s marquee matchup was down by 5 percent compared to last year. Compared to other recent Super Bowls, viewership was the lowest since Super Bowl 2007, which had a little over 93 million people tuning in to watch the big game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDHVTI"&gt;This year’s Super Bowl was also faced with several technical issues; most notably, CBS All Access subscribers trying to watch the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271648/cbs-all-access-app-problems-super-bowl"&gt;experienced technical issues&lt;/a&gt;. A lower viewer turnout may have contributed to the matchup itself, as it was a particularly large blowout with the game's outcome quite clear before the start of the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
