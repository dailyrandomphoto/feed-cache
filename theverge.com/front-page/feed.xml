    <title>Sony acquires Bluepoint Games, the studio behind its incredible remasters and remakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpOvCR2eBMl6J3ccRTrCBBcaMpY=/114x0:1346x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931319/bluepoint.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HoFCeX"&gt;Some of the very best games on PlayStation 5 so far are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;old titles made new&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s fitting that &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/30/welcoming-bluepoint-games-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;Sony is officially acquiring Bluepoint Games&lt;/a&gt;, the acclaimed studio that specializes in remasters. It’s the team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288462/demons-souls-remake-ps5-teaser-trailer-playstation-5-sony"&gt;that brought us the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt; remakes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9529389/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection-review-playstation-4"&gt;fantastic remasters of the first three &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10777180/gravity-rush-remastered-review-sony-ps4"&gt;cult-classic &lt;em&gt;Gravity Rush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and both the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid HD Collection &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Ico &amp;amp; Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Collection &lt;/em&gt;for previous gen consoles. Bluepoint was behind the excellent 2013 port of &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt; to the PS4 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3GpMI"&gt;That’s not the only reason Sony’s Bluepoint buy isn’t surprising though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555358/sony-housemarque-returnal-developer-acquisition-bluepoint"&gt;The company spilled the beans in June&lt;/a&gt; when it bought &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;developer Housemarque, but accidentally uploaded an image showing a Bluepoint acquisition instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMX9WE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;..so apparently PlayStation Japan uploaded the wrong image with their first tweet on Housemarque's acquisition, and it actually mentions a Bluepoint acquisition &lt;a href="https://t.co/yQBHtLbG5c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yQBHtLbG5c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nibel (@Nibellion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2nkv6"&gt;It’s not clear what the acquisition might mean for Bluepoint, but perhaps we’ll see remasters  and remakes more often with Sony’s additional resources? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9VZyx"&gt;Sony’s under some pressure right now to show that it has killer content for the PS5, since every first-party game it promised to deliver in 2021 (save the great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) have been delayed. &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;were all originally supposed to be 2021 releases&lt;/a&gt;, but even &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;got pushed back to February&lt;/a&gt;. Third-party games have seen delays as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHWuMK"&gt;The company’s been shoring up its studios to make that happen — in addition to Housemarque and Bluepoint, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662706/sony-firesprite-the-playroom-developers-playstation-studios"&gt;it purchased Firesprite, developers of &lt;em&gt;The Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GthlK"&gt;Sony also announced a remake from another acclaimed remastering and porting studio: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665460/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5-darth-revan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in development at Aspyr, perhaps best known for porting countless titles to Mac &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_ported_by_Aspyr"&gt;but also recently active&lt;/a&gt; in bringing older games to the Nintendo Switch. It’ll be console-exclusive to PS5. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455810/sony-ps5-profitable-uncharted-4-pc-investor-presentation"&gt;as we spotted in May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;games are coming to PC... and PS5, too, with the new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfrfJn_-24g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes both &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/em&gt; and a very good spinoff in &lt;em&gt;The Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ut3SeS"&gt;It’s a great time to love old games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDkUM9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch flags multiple types of irregular heartbeats, study shows  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI4eE3YWBBmkd5xpULj_tMwBQ0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931094/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btdYqJ"&gt;People who get irregular pulse notifications on an Apple Watch but don’t have atrial fibrillation — the condition the feature focuses on detecting — could still have another type of problem with their heartbeat, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010063"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwctQo"&gt;The findings show that even if someone with a concerning alert from their Apple Watch doesn’t get an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, they may not be in the clear, says study author Marco Perez, the director of the Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center. “Even if you didn’t find atrial fibrillation, we were finding a lot of people who had something else that probably needed some clinical attention,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIkRfb"&gt;The analysis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;, was done using data from the Apple Heart Study, which was designed to test the Apple Watch’s ability to detect irregular heart rhythms. It launched in 2017 and included over 400,000 participants. In the study, anyone who got an irregular pulse notification from the watch was sent a clinical ECG patch, which could monitor their heart rhythm over a longer period of time. About 2,000 participants got an irregular pulse notification, and an earlier analysis showed that around &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183"&gt;a third of those people&lt;/a&gt; who then wore an ECG patch had atrial fibrillation show up during that monitoring period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpZsC6"&gt;This new study looked at the ECG patch data from the remaining participants that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have atrial fibrillation detected. “If we didn’t find atrial fibrillation — what did we find?” Perez says. Around 40 percent of those people had some other type of irregular pulse, including premature atrial contractions (extra heartbeats coming from the top of the heart) and premature ventricular contractions (extra heartbeats from the bottom of the heart). “They had a lot of these extra heartbeats,” he says. “Those are things that we pay attention to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apUjzJ"&gt;Cardiologists still don’t have a good grasp on how dangerous those types of frequent extra heartbeats can be, and often don’t agree on how or if they should be treated, Perez says. They’ve been linked to the development of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but there isn’t a clear understanding of the best way to manage them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmqT4"&gt;The study also showed that almost a third of study participants who did not have atrial fibrillation detected on the ECG patch said that they eventually went on to get the condition diagnosed outside of the study. So even if someone doesn’t get a diagnosis on an initial evaluation, it may make sense to keep an eye on them going forward. “We probably have to start thinking about the best strategy for following those patients over time,” Perez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a63Ifo"&gt;Right now, there’s a wide range of responses to these types of alerts. If someone tells a cardiologist that they had an irregular pulse notification, the doctor might do a quick, 10-second check on an ECG in the office. Other doctors might send them home with a patch for a week. Still others, if there are other factors that make them suspicious, might want to do longer-term monitoring. The technology is still new and the approach is still evolving, Perez says.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsmnP9"&gt;Additional research will help refine the approach. But for now, this study implies that people who get irregular pulse warnings should keep an eye on their heart health, Perez says. “There might very well be something that is going on that could cause you to have an irregular pulse, and could be a sign of something wrong with your heart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KY8K5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmhRf8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The rumored Noctua-equipped RTX 3070 appeared on Asus’ Facebook page</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus x Noctua RTX 3070" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Kdwmc3K12Hsy5a3YIUI3l7rFdM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931062/asusnoctuartx3070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e4vPrZ"&gt;There have been rumors that Asus partnered with Noctua, maker of very quiet PC case fans and this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535729/noctua-nh-p1-passive-cpu-cooler-no-fan-silent"&gt;silent, fan-less CPU cooler&lt;/a&gt;, to make a custom Nvidia RTX 3070 desktop graphics card that looks like no other. While its existence has leaked a few times, picked up by &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/asus-noctua-30-series-graphics-card/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was quick to spot that an Asus employee in Vietnam posted images of the graphics card and other info to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/asusvn/posts/"&gt;Asus ROG Vietnam Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. Those assets have since been taken down, but not before &lt;em&gt;Wccftech &lt;/em&gt;was able to snag the photos and take note of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ3Ka3"&gt;This new GPU, apparently called the RTX3070-08G-NOCTUA, won’t be as affordable as your average RTX 3070 (MSRP of $499), plus the cost of a couple of Noctua fans. Asus’ Facebook page temporarily listed the price as 26 million đồng, which converts roughly to about $1,100. &lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;. Though, we won’t know the official pricing or release dates and regions until Asus posts the info again without quickly removing it afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus x Noctua RTX 3070" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7hg8xl6Zkq9ZYc36BikNswplaaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890079/ASUS_GeForce_RTX_3070_OC_Graphics_Card_With_Noctua_Cooling_Solution__3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wccftech.com/asus-geforce-rtx-3070-graphics-cards-featuring-noctua-cooling-solution-pictured/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renders that show off the Asus x Noctua RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btBDOr"&gt;In case Noctua isn’t a familiar name to you, its fans are often the brand of choice for PC builders who are looking for a way to keep their rig running quietly, while also adding a unique look. It’s best known for the beige and brown colorway seen above, which looks both sophisticated and retro. Beyond aesthetics, though, Noctua products tend to keep your gear cool while running quietly, while sometimes coming in a slimmer profile than other aftermarket fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfL6EV"&gt;Noctua’s fans have such a good reputation, in fact, that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaL3KCQ1Hg"&gt;some people have done surgery on their GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, removing their stock fans and replacing them with Noctua case fans. There seem to be plenty of people who have done it, after glancing at &lt;a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/1132866-using-noctua-fans-as-gpu-fans-on-the-stock-1080-heatsink/"&gt;this forum post at Linus Tech Tips&lt;/a&gt;. This Asus and Noctua collaboration seems like the ideal option for people who aren’t as familiar with disassembling components. It seems like you’ll pay dearly for it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejPmq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX9cM2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Stagg electric kettle has the best boiling button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RisR5kIO444z_YFTZjdJciBZQ-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931058/dbohn_210622_4648_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YHTVDL"&gt;It’s a strange thing that one of the most enjoyable physical interfaces I use in my day-to-day life is on a kettle. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fproducts%2Fstaggekg&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696994%2Ffellow-stagg-kettle-dial-button-tea-coffee-interface" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stagg EKG Electric Kettle&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, a $150 appliance that’s almost entirely controlled through a single, magnificent dial that is a strong contender for the best way to turn on a kettle (a competition that, admittedly, lacks much competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f13Sz2"&gt;Using the Stagg is a delightful experience of tactility. The main control is a single dial/button located on the front right of the base. Turning it on takes just a single press, a deep, solid click that lets you know through touch and sound that you’ve turned on the kettle. Turning it off is a similar single press, another resonant click to announce that the kettle is off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4kPI0mXtliotXRmTRa6a332xlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687321/dbohn_210622_4648_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ffVZuZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s adjusting the target temperature, done through an incredibly satisfying rotation of the dial, with each step on the infinitely rotatable ratcheted wheel giving a physical indication that you’re adjusting it forward and back. You can watch the temperature tick up or down on a small display opposite the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnqhdF"&gt;And it’s here that the Stagg shines: adjusting the temperature is intuitive and, more importantly, fast and easy. On my old kettle, temperature had to be adjusted by manually clicking plus/minus buttons each time, with a complex system of programmable presets (meant to alleviate the awkward controls) that, after years, I still never really grokked. The Stagg, on the other hand, is as simple as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;adjusting the volume on an iPod&lt;/a&gt; or the flame on a stove burner — just spin and win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7elxs6"&gt;Once you’ve dialed in your temperature, that’s it. The Stagg will heat your water to the desired degree (in either Fahrenheit or Celsius), and then you’re ready to enjoy it for tea, coffee, or any other hot beverage of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AC92wYNLuOHDdz6FsGXMVDbSxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687318/dbohn_210622_4648_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jzNGIg"&gt;The Stagg also builds an extra feature hidden into its dial. Pressing and holding it down will activate a built-in stopwatch, perfect for timing your steeping tea or brewing coffee without requiring any other gadgets or gizmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lki8bX"&gt;The best proof of how capable the Stagg kettle’s dial is, however, comes in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fblogs%2Flearn%2Fhow-to-play-wormy-on-your-electric-kettle&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696994%2Ffellow-stagg-kettle-dial-button-tea-coffee-interface" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rather unique easter egg&lt;/a&gt; that Fellow includes on every electric kettle: a functional version of &lt;em&gt;Snake&lt;/em&gt; known as &lt;em&gt;Wormy&lt;/em&gt;, which can be activated by rapidly toggling the Fahrenheit / Celsius switch located on the rear of the device back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DVl19X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A luxury product, but one that’s enjoyable to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sZmsi9"&gt;Of course, it’s hard to talk about the Stagg without mentioning the elephant in the room: it’s a $150 gadget that boils water. It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much a luxury product. There are cheaper kettles out there that will do the same thing (that is to say, boil water to a specific temperature) as fast and efficiently, if not faster, than the Stagg. You can buy a stovetop kettle for $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydubjI"&gt;You’re paying a premium here for the design, and Stagg’s main control scheme — the single, otherwise nondescript dial — is a big part of that. It’s what allows for the core function of the Stagg to be as elegant as its Instagram-fodder form: simple, easy to use, and stylish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt6hmn"&gt;Is it worth $150 for the button alone? Not for a kettle. But it is certainly the caliber of button that you’d want from a kettle that costs that much, a piece of UX that elevates the entire product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e0fvC"&gt;And most important of all, it makes a morning cup of tea just a little more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did — the Japanese corporate entity issued a press release insisting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BLEqT"&gt;On Thursday morning, Zynga spokesperson Sarah Ross also denied the report, saying in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/report-games-in-the-works-for-4k-nintendo-console-that-1847771280"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “To clarify, Zynga does not have a 4K developer kit from Nintendo.” Zynga was the only developer named out of the 11 companies that &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported receiving a 4K Switch developement kit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvtXQt_gsnw_c91aFLwK8mp6mWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889057/nintendo_twitter_bloomberg_report_switch_pro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUcdR"&gt;While there’s always a possibility that the language technically allows for most if not all of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report to be correct — that, for instance, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a 4K Switch development kit, and that Nintendo &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push developers to build 4K content, and that Nintendo is simply &lt;em&gt;not pushing that anymore — &lt;/em&gt;Nintendo is attempting to say that the entire report is not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ewPtO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; appears to be standing by its report, which isn’t much of a surprise. It comes from respected game/tech industry journalists who have been extremely well-sourced in the past, and this report is no exception: it cites anonymous employees at 11 different game companies all saying they have a 4K Switch development kit. Following Nintendo’s tweet, the publication simply added an additional line about Nintendo’s denial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDB7HZ"&gt;Weighed against a Nintendo statement with even a little bit of wiggle room, I’d tend to believe 11 sources over the company, particularly when that company’s under investor pressure to have its new OLED handheld do well on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPHp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:56PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Bloomberg has minimally updated its post to include Nintendo’s new denial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIPxAQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 30th, 9:58AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Zynga denying possession of a 4K developer kit from Nintendo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY5UHR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYcQ1i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games makes children’s privacy services free for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lr2Qbf_zCLyMSal9OlUp_Ia29f4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930857/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIQAtb"&gt;Epic Games announced Thursday that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-and-superawesome-offer-free-parent-verification-for-all-developers"&gt;making its parent verification services&lt;/a&gt; free for all developers in order to make it easier to build games that keep kids safe online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUlpxu"&gt;Epic Games bought SuperAwesome, a safe kidtech company, last September. With this new addition to the company, Epic Games was able to launch its Kids Web Services (KWS) program, allowing developers to “verify the identity of parents or guardians when granting their children permission to use features that collect personal information.” Once a parent is verified through the system, they receive what Epic calls the “ParentGraph,” which makes it simpler to offer verification through other games on the Epic platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCWI8D"&gt;Epic says that this system not only protects children and parents, but “minimizes personal data processing, since the parent or guardian is only providing their verification details once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YBpCit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The metaverse will be made up of many types of experiences and will not be controlled by any one company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WY48IK"&gt;As part of the announcement, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney couldn’t help but offer yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;definition of the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. “The metaverse will be made up of many types of experiences and will not be controlled by any one company,” Sweeney said. “This will require all of us who are building toward this future to create experiences that are not only interoperable but also take the safety of our audiences into account, no matter their age. By making KWS parent verification free we hope to enable more developers to create safer digital experiences, while empowering parents to make the choices that are right for their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtWDl0"&gt;Over the last few weeks and years, children’s safety and online privacy has grown into a more pressing issue for federal regulators. Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported on internal research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;at Facebook suggesting that&lt;/a&gt; Instagram knew how the social network had a negative effect on the mental health of teenagers. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;TikTok paid nearly $6 million&lt;/a&gt; to the Federal Trade Commission for violating a children’s privacy law, called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei4yHG"&gt;By making KWS free for developers, Epic Games says that it’s making it easier for more companies to provide kid-friendly services while adhering to laws like COPPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQsxH1"&gt;“Regulators around the world have led the charge by introducing laws intended to make the internet safer for kids like COPPA in the US, the Children’s Code in the UK and GDPR-K in Europe,” Dylan Collins, founder of SuperAwesome, said in a statement Thursday. “We share this vision and want to make compliance an accessible reality for developers and creators of all sizes. Free parent verification is a critical industry step to make it easier for everyone to say yes to kid-safe experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6l3QnL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciBx4P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nreal’s new AR sunglasses are made for binge watching TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nreal Air smart glasses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzGyI5aZ9JZ2PeTyxaNetUdUTBU=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930661/Close_up.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nreal Air smart glasses.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UKei5Q"&gt;Augmented reality company Nreal is launching a cheaper, iOS-compatible, more compact version of its smart glasses. The new Nreal Air glasses are supposed to ship starting in December 2021 across Japan, China, and South Korea. The price isn’t set, but Nreal says they’ll cost “a fraction of the price” of its earlier Nreal Light glasses, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;started selling for around $600&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xl2bn"&gt;Based on Nreal’s description, the new Nreal Air glasses have some core similarities with the Nreal Light glasses from 2020. Both are designed to look like relatively normal sunglasses and pitched as ideal for projecting a virtual big-screen display in front of your eyes. They’re both using micro OLED displays for their augmented reality optics and are powered by a phone via a tether cable. And they’re both aimed at consumers rather than businesses, researchers, or the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pGfvvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike Nreal’s last glasses, there are no outward-facing cameras&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mujcaY"&gt;But Nreal Air glasses have a different feature set than their predecessors. Similar to Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap hardware, the original Nreal Light glasses could map physical space around you with a set of outward-facing cameras. Nreal Air glasses, by contrast, don’t have any outward-facing cameras. They can display video and phone apps, but they can’t see what’s around you, which means they don’t have the spatial awareness and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167724/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-hand-tracking-clay-air-5g-qualcomm"&gt;hand tracking options&lt;/a&gt; the Nreal Light does. You’ll control them with a smartphone app, an option that’s also available on Light glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgrBGC"&gt;The upside is that Nreal Air glasses are ironically much lighter than Light glasses at 77 grams instead of 106 grams. They don’t have the slightly bug-eyed look that Light glasses do — in product renders, they look more like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban’s smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, minus the front-facing cameras. (The Ray-Ban Stories glasses, which have cameras but no AR display, weigh around 50 grams.) The new glasses let users tilt the lenses at three angles, making it potentially easier for more people to get a clearer image. Nreal Light glasses launched with support for specific 5G Android phones, but the new glasses will also work while tethered to iPhones and iPads as well as “most” Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nreal Air AR glasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgbB8X0G2FIDpUqdNxB7BMK-CRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888760/Nreal_Air_Front.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YxrEiQ"&gt;Compared to the Light, the Nreal Air glasses also have a higher screen refresh rate of 90Hz and an increased pixel density of 49 PPD. Nreal says the glasses’ field of view is 46 degrees, compared to the Nreal Light’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nreal/status/1281272536291053568?lang=en"&gt;52 degrees&lt;/a&gt; — it equates the Air’s view with a 130-inch screen from 3 meters away or a 201-inch screen at 6 meters. If wearers have friends with Nreal glasses, there’s a viewing party option that turns that screen into a shared virtual theater where they can all watch the same media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rLPdT"&gt;Nreal intends to expand the Air glasses’ rollout in 2022, and a spokesperson says the US is a “major market” for the company, although it hasn’t announced plans to ship there. As with the Light, it’s going to be selling the glasses in partnership with major phone carriers; it hasn’t named specific partners, but it’s previously worked with Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Korea’s LG Uplus, and Japan’s KDDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CNCtJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;78 percent of users in Korea watched streaming video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a5PBzD"&gt;An Nreal spokesperson says the company developed the Air after realizing that most users were primarily either using the glasses to watch streaming video (and to a lesser extent, browse the web) or to develop apps for the platform. In Korea, around 78 percent of users watched streaming content with the glasses. “Consumers today are seeking lighter, but longer lasting AR glasses exclusively for streaming media and working from home,” company founder Chi Xu said in a statement. According to Nreal, the lack of cameras is also supposed to reassure bystanders that the glasses don’t threaten their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKd1pj"&gt;Nreal is one of a handful of consumer smart glasses, and these results could hint at what people actually want from AR headsets. But Nreal also hasn’t made a concerted play for experiences that mix the real and virtual worlds — a use case that other companies like Facebook have emphasized more heavily. Instead, it’s focusing on something it already knows people love: binge watching video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify expands interactive podcast polls and Q&amp;As to even more shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUBkd85ujuQVEiAvfUI4FLE0xw4=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930558/spotifyinteractie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oUkhC"&gt;Spotify is making podcasts on its platform more interactive. The company announced today that podcasters who create their shows in Anchor, its creation software, will be able to build interactive polls and Q&amp;amp;As into their programs. Listeners across 160 markets will be able to engage with them. For now, the functionality is only available to Anchor podcasters — not even for people who use Megaphone, Spotify’s podcast hosting platform — and it only works on the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7K644"&gt;To view a poll or Q&amp;amp;A, you’ll see it at the bottom of your Spotify mobile app. Once you respond to a poll, you’ll be able to see how others voted, while Q&amp;amp;A answers will be sent to the podcaster privately. These podcasters can then choose to pin and publicly display the Spotify username of the person who replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qplNbf"&gt;The interactive polls were first tested in September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452248/spotify-podcast-polls-interactive-test-exclusive-app"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and in February, Spotify brought them and Q&amp;amp;As to more creators. The company says podcasters have used them to get guest suggestions, hear feedback, and gamify their shows. Interestingly, Spotify has also tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295859/spotify-interactive-ads-podcasts-in-app-offer-launch"&gt;interactive ads&lt;/a&gt;, but those seemingly have yet to launch, even for wider testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uidijz"&gt;Of course, these new features allow Spotify to keep podcasters on the app where their listeners live. They don’t have to promote their Instagram or any other app to foster engagement, meaning they might have a better success rate in encouraging their listeners to share feedback. At the same time, it’s yet another incentive for podcasters who might be looking for a hosting provider. Anchor creators can already create shows with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21514855/spotify-music-podcast-format-anchor-listen"&gt;full, licensed music&lt;/a&gt; built in, and use the company’s sponsorships tool, so Spotify will seemingly keep creating functionality meant to intrigue and lure podcasters to the service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlueStacks X is a new and free way to play Android games in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s8TgzqHBUq6jAC-aeG_QEO87lI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930557/bluestacksx.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluestacks X brings Android games to the browser.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bluestacks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eHKv18"&gt;BlueStacks started off life as an Android emulator for Windows more than 10 years ago, allowing anyone to run native Arm-based or x86 Android apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2696168/bluestacks-android-apps-windows-8"&gt;on Windows PCs and tablets&lt;/a&gt;. Now BlueStacks is transitioning to the cloud, bringing Android games to the browser and across iOS, Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux devices, and even inside Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBB9GC"&gt;BlueStacks X launches today as the only cloud gaming service that offers free streaming of mobile games across multiple platforms and devices. BlueStacks has built its hybrid cloud technology under its &lt;a href="https://now.gg/"&gt;now.gg brand&lt;/a&gt; to make this possible, combined with Amazon’s AWS Graviton servers. BlueStacks X also offloads part of the compute and graphics rendering to local devices thanks to advancements in modern web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsEmTQ"&gt;The result is the ability to play a variety of Android mobile games inside a browser with no downloads necessary. BlueStacks X is launching as a beta, with around 14 games available to stream and the promise of more titles being added weekly. Games like &lt;em&gt;Raid: Shadow Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Disney Sorcerer’s Arena&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lords Mobile: Kingdom Wars&lt;/em&gt; are all available today. You can also use the regular native app to play more than 200 games that aren’t available in the cloud just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hrc61MqCDwDF7AqY9rCfcgHo_0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889777/bluestacksxbrowser.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BlueStacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueStacks X lets you run mobile Android games inside a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IC7Y9s"&gt;BlueStacks has also created its own Discord bot, &lt;a href="https://cloudy.gg/"&gt;Cloudy&lt;/a&gt;, that will integrate into Discord servers and allow friends to launch cloud-based Android games and share their gameplay sessions with others. “We’ll also allow you to customize what games you want on your server, and if you play those games together you automatically get connected to a Discord voice channel so everyone can just click and play the cloud game,” explains BlueStacks CEO Rosen Sharma, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrSIEU"&gt;A social feed will also be integrated into Discord, so if your friend buys a gun in a game, it might appear in the Discord feed much like how PlayStation and Xbox display achievements in their social feeds. “It’s like what Venmo did to PayPal,” says Sharma. “PayPal were just sending money and Venmo made it into a social feed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1JbU2SRCARxE4s__pM6L8o_UYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889768/Cloudy_Bot___Feed_message.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BlueStacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueStacks’ Cloudy Discord bot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXDqJP"&gt;BlueStacks is offering all of this free of charge, supported by ads. Sharma tells me that you’ll only see pre-roll ads, and not the type that will interrupt gameplay. Down the line there could be subscription offerings for its cloud-based service, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNQ4l2"&gt;BlueStacks has been focused on mobile gaming since 2016, after it was clear its user base was mainly using the app to access games. “When we started, people were like ‘who’s going to use this?’” admits Sharma. “In 2016 it became all about gaming, and gaming became the predominant use case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTu2BS"&gt;The cloud infrastructure for Arm-based mobile games simply didn’t exist 10 years ago, and suitable Arm-based servers only started rolling out in 2018 to make BlueStacks X a reality. BlueStacks has been growing in popularity in recent years, and Sharma tells me it gets between 250,000 to 300,000 downloads a day. There’s even 20,000 enterprise customers using BlueStacks to access Android mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsAVET"&gt;BlueStack’s cloud launch and popularity comes just as Microsoft gets ready to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650000/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support"&gt;won’t be shipping&lt;/a&gt; Windows 11 with its Android apps integration, despite promising it as a key new feature at an event in June.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45L9Sm"&gt;Sharma doesn’t seem convinced by Microsoft’s Android integration in Windows, though. “There are two things Microsoft needs to figure out: is it apps and is it their way of getting Instagram, TikTok, and those things; or is it games?” says Sharma. “I don’t think it’s the same beast, and those are two completely different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqe7RA"&gt;BlueStacks has been working with Microsoft for two years to help the company optimize its Hyper-V for Android, says Sharma, noting that the company has been very focused on the apps side. “Microsoft has always had the app problem, and in the past they used to pay people like the top developers to bring their apps, but that doesn’t really work in mobile because there’s just too many apps,” explains Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMQHHy"&gt;While BlueStacks is compatible with Google Play Store apps, Microsoft is partnering with Amazon, meaning developers will need to tweak their apps and games to remove key integration with Google Play Services. “My sense is any play that requires the developer to do a small amount of work or a large amount of work is a slow and long-drawn process,” says Sharma. “It’s unlikely to be successful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKTl7c"&gt;Microsoft is pushing ahead with Android apps on Windows 11, and we’ll likely see a preview of its initial work in the coming weeks. It’s still around 10 years late to the Android-apps-on-Windows party, but that might not matter if the integration is done well and performance is solid across multiple devices. That’s easier said than done, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9bks1"&gt;Meanwhile, BlueStacks X launches in the browser today, available at &lt;a href="https://x.bluestacks.com/#/cloudGames"&gt;x.bluestacks.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Beam (second-gen) review: Atmos(t) a minor upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Dolby Atmos isn’t the reason you should buy it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4eOVyH"&gt;From the moment Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22671384/sonos-beam-2-atmos-soundbar-announced-price-specs"&gt;announced the second-generation Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar, it was evident that this sequel is more refresh than reinvention. The new Beam, available October 5th and now slightly more expensive at $449, is the same compact size as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;the 2018 original&lt;/a&gt;. The speaker drivers inside the unit are completely unchanged. Sonos has touched up the appearance by switching from a fabric covering on the first Beam to the company’s signature perforated plastic with finely drilled holes running along the entire front of the soundbar. And because it’s equipped with more processing power and eARC, the new model supports immersive Dolby Atmos audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feJYdY"&gt;But the target customer for the Beam hasn’t changed one bit: this is a soundbar for people who want to upgrade their TV’s lousy built-in audio — with the enticing side benefit of native integration with Sonos’ multiroom audio system. At its price, the Beam is more expensive than entry-level soundbars from Vizio and the like. And if you’re willing to spend double, you can get much larger, beefier Atmos soundbars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;like Sonos’ own Arc&lt;/a&gt; or alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660982/bose-smart-soundbar-900-dolby-atmos-sonos-arc"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt;. The Beam is dwarfed in size by the Arc, and its sound performance doesn’t approach the same level. But I can still see and understand the appeal of choosing this one instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RwRe6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10781329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G590tI"&gt;Maybe you’re in an apartment where more powerful speakers would agitate the neighbors. Maybe you don’t care about or feel the need to invest in premium-tier home theater audio: you just want to make your movies and TV shows sound noticeably better, and the Beam’s smart speaker functions and wide support for music streaming are just icing on the cake. If that’s what you’re after, the second-gen Beam does the job equally as well as the first. Slightly better, even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpnStNO0TbRnhnK13IEX_uxO3x0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888935/cwelch_290921_4780_5684.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Beam has a perforated polycarbonate grille instead of fabric, making it easier to clean and more resistant to wear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M6PB6r"&gt;Just don’t get your hopes up about the whole Dolby Atmos surround sound part. When reviewing the original Beam, Nilay said the key was to not overthink it. But by making Atmos a pillar of the second-gen model, Sonos is leaving room for people to do just that and come in with unrealistic expectations. As I’ll get into later, for all the work Sonos has put into virtualization and tuning to try to replicate Atmos’ enveloping height channels, it turns out there’s really no substitute for speakers that are pointed, well, &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Dg1Ag"&gt;Aside from the sleeker perforated front side, everything else about the Beam’s external appearance is identical to the original. You’ve got the same capacitive touch playback controls on top — including a button to mute the built-in voice assistant mics — and the same ports on back: there’s HDMI, an ethernet jack, a connect button, and the power input. What’s new about the second-gen Beam is that Sonos has upgraded the HDMI port to support eARC, which enables Atmos and comes with other perks that often go unadvertised. For example, if you’ve got a TV with HDMI 2.1, you shouldn’t encounter any audio and video sync issues (even when gaming), which could be frustratingly common on the first Beam. That alone is a reason I’d buy this hardware over the original given the choice — even if you can still find the old Beam for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8lVEa"&gt;Setup remains a relatively quick, easy process using the Sonos app for Android or iOS. I plugged the Beam into my LG CX OLED TV, opened the app, the new device was automatically recognized, and then I held my phone near the soundbar to finish linking it to my system via NFC. iPhone owners still get exclusive access to Sonos’ Trueplay feature, which uses the phone’s mic to optimize the soundbar’s audio output to sound best for any room in which it’s being used. Considering the Beam has its own mic array, why not just build automatic Trueplay into the thing? Android users can still take manual control of sliders for bass, treble, and loudness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsE8yCMmBzaJpYtlEhxaMzCvRXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888940/cwelch_290921_4780_5686.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top controls are identical to those on the old model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxaKWFPLyjazrFUH4uG0ZZoa2Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888938/cwelch_290921_4780_5701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As are the ports, but now you get an eARC HDMI port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mRIsI1"&gt;The Beam’s 40-percent faster processor allowed Sonos to add more “arrays” — the software that coordinates the playback and sophisticated phase algorithms between all the soundbar’s speakers — and the new ones are fully dedicated to surround sound and height effects. But remember, the acoustic architecture inside hasn’t changed from the first Beam. There’s a center tweeter, four midwoofers, and three passive radiators that Sonos says help to enhance lower frequencies. However, physics are physics, and we’re talking about a soundbar that’s barely over two feet wide; in other words, you’re going to want a Sub if you need growling, powerful bass. The Beam won’t get you there on its own, but neither does the Arc or most any standalone soundbar for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svqprA"&gt;But the Beam is still a strong performer that tends to genuinely surprise people for its size, and this one fares even better. It can fill most smaller to midsized living rooms (or bedrooms) without straining itself. And the amount of presence and great stereo separation of the first model has carried over to the new device. The general surround virtualization effect is quite good: you can get lost in movies without it being obvious that all the sound is originating from the soundbar beneath the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u4Bmo"&gt;Watch a car chase or some fighter jet sequences, and you’ll hear that the Beam does an impressive job having audio “swoop” in from the left and right sides of a room — assuming your walls aren’t terribly far apart. The feeling of spaciousness is very real, and in A/B testing with the original Beam, this is where those new arrays are making the biggest difference. I’ve seen Sonos describe it as panoramic sound, and that seems right on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7detyi"&gt;The company has also made some tweaks that result in even clearer dialogue in regular listening, and the “speech enhancement” mode is still there if you need even more emphasis on what’s being said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic_ObSCz6SBTUL2-DGpoj6o9f4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888939/cwelch_290921_4780_5681.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The actual speaker drivers inside are also unchanged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zd8pLz"&gt;But as for the Atmos part? Meh. My bedroom has fairly low ceilings, but even when sampling go-to Atmos action scenes in movies, I can’t say I often picked up on any standout height effects. Don’t buy the Sonos Beam in hopes that it’ll legitimately sound as though audio is coming from above. It just doesn’t get there. You can bounce carefully phased sound waves off walls all you want, but it won’t hold a candle to a proper Atmos system with in-ceiling speakers. Even some owners of premium soundbars like the Arc that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have up-firing speakers don’t consider the Atmos aspect to be a game-changer. If your room conditions are ideal, you might get some hints of verticality, but there’s no real illusion of 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i09ALE"&gt;Even if it’s low on Atmos magic, the Beam can be the start of a really great surround system if you tack on a Sub and other Sonos speakers as rear surrounds. (Opting for the Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers is a popular way to save on the latter.) You’re looking at well over $1,000 to build a proper 5.1 setup, but if you see yourself staying in the Sonos ecosystem for a long time to come, it’s worth considering. Adding in extra speakers can quickly make you forget about the Beam’s size constraints. And you can always upgrade to an Arc down the line and keep everything else in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="bulhwl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10781068"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXfvgD3GSByN-6erWH864zxnjjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889000/DSCF5692_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant voice commands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ2FCK"&gt;Everything else about the Beam can already be found on the first model. It’s still totally competent as a music speaker (and the improved virtualization helps here too), though not as well-matched for that as something like the Sonos Five. You can choose to use either Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa as your preferred voice assistant — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700724/sonos-smart-speakers-concurrency-google"&gt;but not both at once&lt;/a&gt;, even if it’s technically possible. (You can also just skip setting up a voice assistant if you’d rather avoid them). The soundbar supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, so you can play music, podcasts, or other audio to it from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And you can also send TV audio across your other Sonos speakers if you’re so inclined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKsHDl"&gt;At the center of everything is Sonos’ compatibility with pretty much every streaming audio service under the sun. The company has said it’ll add support for high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos tracks from Amazon Music later this year, and hopefully the same will pan out for Apple Music. Sonos is also granting a longtime customer request with the introduction of DTS decoding, another feature coming to all of its soundbars in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6wmBDg"&gt;Sonos’ addition of Dolby Atmos to the second-generation Beam doesn’t magically turn it into some mind-blowing $450 soundbar. But it’s still a very good one made better by the new virtualization upgrades and its seamless integration with your other Sonos gear. That, combined with the company’s impressive commitment to software support, are still the biggest reasons to spend the extra cash on this instead of buying a perfectly good Vizio bar for less. The upgrade to eARC makes for a smoother, more dependable listening experience without any latency issues, and the new design will look better in your living room. But a lack of proper up-firing speakers limits the Atmos potential, and the fact that Sonos has reused so much of the hardware here makes the second-gen Beam feel like a half-step toward something more ambitious. I expect to see bigger things whenever the third generation comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
