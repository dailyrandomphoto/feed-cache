    <title>Nvidia is making buying a gaming laptop more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwG5Ha-sMcpxAh_qKNgGvSWeGNM=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724548/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ie3joe"&gt;Gaming laptops that have Nvidia’s powerful RTX 30-series graphics chips inside are now shipping. I have a first-look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s 2021 GS66 Stealth with the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, and my colleague Monica Chin published two reviews for launch day: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Flow X13&lt;/a&gt; (with its detachable RTX 3080 eGPU) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; with the RTX 3070.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7V70cv"&gt;We discovered something strange: an RTX 3070 can now be faster than an RTX 3080 in some cases. We saw this first-hand in a few benchmark runs, where the RTX 3070 in the GP77 Leopard slightly surpassed the RTX 3080 in the GS66 Stealth. It wasn’t a blowout, just a few odd frames per second more in the benchmarks built into games like &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. But this shouldn’t be happening, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17htY1"&gt;This sounds like a huge controversy, but the explanation is nothing new. It’s just become something shadier than it ever needed to be. Nvidia is no longer adding “Max-Q” labels to the weaker, more power-efficient variants of its laptop-grade GPUs, and so you can no longer easily tell if you’re getting a full-fat GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoQo2n"&gt;The RTX 3080 in the GS66 Stealth is actually a Max-Q variant with a boost clock of 1,245MHz and a maximum wattage of 95 watts, which is about as weak as an RTX 3080 can get, according to Nvidia’s spec sheets. But customers probably wouldn’t know this by looking at this laptop’s box, MSI’s site, or the numerous retailer sites selling this model. The GP66 Leopard, on the other hand, is using an RTX 3070 that has a higher clock speed and more wattage than the norm, which explains why it was able to pull ahead a few times during our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7bY5R4IZGgiPi2jLRWNzVa8gRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260491/nvidia_ampere_mobile_gpus_tdp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s breakdown of the range in performance of each RTX 30-series graphics chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J5JwKN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-RTX-30-Ampere-Mobile-will-no-longer-offer-Max-Q-or-Max-P-branding-OEMs-free-to-decide-TGP-and-Max-Q-features-to-implement.515922.0.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;NotebookCheck &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a wide array of wattages each RTX 30-series laptop chip can be set to — but it depends on what kind of laptop the manufacturer wants to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4XR3D"&gt;Thinner, lighter gaming laptops tend to use dialed-back Max-Q versions of Nvidia’s graphics chips for better efficiency (indicated as GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q in the past, for instance), while others use ones that don’t have the Max-Q branding, and thus can be trusted to deliver better performance that’s more akin to the desktop versions of the GPU. Now, Nvidia is letting manufacturers hide which one they’re using in a laptop. It lets companies treat Nvidia’s mobile graphics cards on a spec sheet as if they all have consistent performance across all devices, but that’s far from being true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BBJcXG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Max-Q now apparently stands for “Maximum Questions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMHIKo"&gt;This lack of transparency is the key difference between how these RTX 30-series graphics chips are being marketed versus previous generations that utilized Max-Q chips, and it may lead to a lot of confused people. Nvidia also doesn’t require manufacturers that use Max-Q graphics chips to have Max-Q stickers on the laptop, which it has done previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej1x41"&gt;Naturally, MSI isn’t the only company already taking advantage of this. The Asus TUF Dash 15 and Gigabyte Aorus 15G that I’m testing each claim to have the RTX 3070, but each omits the crucial info that you’re getting the Max-Q variant of the chip. Like MSI’s laptop, you won’t find a detailed breakdown of the GPU’s boost clock speed or wattage requirements on either box or on retail listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Jrrf4"&gt;That’s crucial info to communicate to people, as they all but confirm whether you’re getting a slower Max-Q variant or a faster standard part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cqn-R7Wsf8zDSpPvZ-jgSgCLAZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251174/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvXgs"&gt;Why would Nvidia make this change, knowing most average consumers will fall for it? When I asked, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it “strongly encourage[s] OEMs to list clocks and other technologies a laptop supports, including Advanced Optimus, Dynamic Boost 2, and more.” Judging by manufacturer websites so far, that “encouragement” doesn’t seem to be working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8JxZh"&gt;Nvidia also says the Nvidia Control Panel app, which is accessible &lt;em&gt;only after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve paid for and set up one of these laptops, now provides more spec info than before. Not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhtE8H"&gt;When I pressed Nvidia on whether it’d work to make these details more transparent to customers when they’re researching which laptop to buy, a spokesperson said the company is “reviewing additional ways to give consumers more insight prior to purchase.” It seems like a simple way of going about this would be to keep a running list of each model with detailed specs, like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fproducts%2Fg-sync-monitors%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22243065%2Fnvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia does with G-Sync-compatible monitors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sWwCY"&gt;There’s always a degree of uncertainty as to how each laptop is going to perform in the real world. The Max-Q branding, at the very least, helped customers see right away that they were getting a machine with a graphics chip that had a lower clock speed, thus resulting in slightly dialed-back performance than you’d get from the full-fat chip. Now, you’ll either have to read comparison reviews or hope that Nvidia reverses its policy that lets  manufacturers keep people in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PpftU"&gt;We’ll update this post if and when Nvidia shares its plans to improve transparency for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0ITXz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says Fios internet should be returning to normal in the Northeast after disruptive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STHJWLoKzC7slsq44ZHqbze82kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722836/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon says that it has resolved issues with Fios, its fiber optic network, that affected many locations in the Northeastern US for hours on Tuesday. The company says that things should be returning to normal, but a fiber cut in Brooklyn may mean that some might still be without service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiIa1L"&gt;Users began reporting problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 11AM ET, and the volume of reports peaked at more than 22,000 on Tuesday. Hotspots for problems on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; included Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers experienced outages as well, though one in Brooklyn still doesn’t have service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2fRI9"&gt;“An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved,” Verizon said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776"&gt;via its support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to many users on the platform. “Network performance and service levels are returning to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iWIVLB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good afternoon and happy new year Darren, Thanks so much for reaching out to us. An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved. Network performance and service levels are returning to normal. Please DM us if not back.  ^RME&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;The account also said at 11:52AM ET that there was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 4:04PM ET on Tuesday, the company said the cut is still affecting customers in the area. However, technicians are working to fix things, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488"&gt;Verizon said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1A4Z1g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our goal is to ensure you have working services! Currently, we are aware of a fiber cut in the Brooklyn NY area. This is impacting a some customers in that area. Great thing is that we are aware and have technicians in the field working to get service back up and working for you!&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to have come from the same places that were experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services in the Northeastern US were tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. Acting Federal Communications Commission chairwoman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel also said&lt;/a&gt; that the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is looking into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrJNwU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work  remotely and go to school online. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is working to get to the bottom of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6JxWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 4:44PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added new information from Verizon about the issues being resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Byte, Vine’s successor, has been purchased by another TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZCcM1PGgLxp0ctKUvP5xTfjmUw=/385x0:2485x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724377/Screen_Shot_2020_01_24_at_4.35.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Byte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s1lxUU"&gt;Byte, a TikTok competitor, has been &lt;a href="https://clashappco.medium.com/byte-app-is-joining-the-clash-family-a21771a4a196"&gt;purchased by Clash&lt;/a&gt;, another TikTok competitor. It sounds as though Clash may be merged into Byte, but the details are vague for the time being. Clash’s website now directs visitors to download Byte, and the company says Clash won’t be available on the iOS App Store for “an extended period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvYt5p"&gt;Clash co-founder Brendon McNerney &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/style/clash-byte-app-acquisition.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the two apps will be released “together as one product” within a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0guEZ9"&gt;“The market for apps that let you create and post videos from your phone has become extremely saturated. There are many competitors with similar (or better) feature sets, and far more distribution,” Byte creator Dom Hofmann, who was previously a co-founder of the video app Vine, wrote in &lt;a href="https://community.byte.co/t/byte-x-clash/60489"&gt;a forum post&lt;/a&gt; today explaining why the app had been sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="45Jlqg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Attack of the TikTok clones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21356971/tiktok-alternatives-instagram-reels-byte-triller-zynn-ban"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iCOY1R"&gt;The combination of the two apps speaks to the immense challenge any company will face going up against TikTok — let alone an independent company without a huge corporate backer and an existing network of apps to prop it up. A ton of TikTok-alikes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356971/tiktok-alternatives-instagram-reels-byte-triller-zynn-ban"&gt;have popped up throughout 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and the smaller apps now face competition not just from TikTok but from TikTok clones built into huge apps like Instagram and Snapchat, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx4Cax"&gt;Hofmann started working on Byte, meant as a successor to Vine, in 2017, before any one app had really cracked video on mobile. But by the time Byte finally launched, in January 2020, TikTok had already blown up and was known for making stars with an audience beyond its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiNVaY"&gt;Throughout 2020, Byte maintained a small and quirky community, and it even set up a program to pay some creators for their videos. But the app never broke out into the mainstream, and its biggest surge seemed to come when TikTok creators were looking for a backup in case then-President Donald Trump followed through with his plans to ban the app in the US. The ban was held up in court, and interest in TikTok competitors seemed to die down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnEWva"&gt;Clash is a newer app, having &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/08/03/clash-app-vine-tiktok-competitor-brendon-mcnerney/"&gt;quietly launched&lt;/a&gt; in beta in late July. It works pretty much the same as TikTok, opening onto a main feed where you can swipe through video after video. Its big hook seemed to be that one co-founder, McNerney, became known as a star on Vine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W57vip"&gt;Going forward, Hofmann writes that Byte needs to “be built upon a clear vision that leads to differentiating features and rapid improvements.” Hofmann will stick around as an adviser to Clash, but he — and most of Byte’s team, it seems — will be moving onto Discord. That means Clash seems to be buying Byte’s technology and name, and it’ll be taking over everything else about the app going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiyGAv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out to Clash for more details on the apps’ future. An email to Byte’s press contact bounced, with a message saying the account had been disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD made a billion dollars more in Q4, and multiple billions in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/co1PuwoIdAMWR2_h4AQ-dgrY430=/401x0:4720x2879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724357/AMD_Ryzen_5000_Series_Lidded_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDrm3k"&gt;AMD is firing on all cylinders these days: it’s the guts of every modern PlayStation and Xbox, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;the desktop CPUs to beat&lt;/a&gt;, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;nearly caught up to Nvidia in GPU performance&lt;/a&gt; (if not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;availability&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s about to challenge Intel in laptops as well — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;with its Ryzen 5000 mobile CPUs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227144/amd-rdna-2-gpu-gaming-laptops-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;RDNA 2 GPUs&lt;/a&gt; due later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0S1x6"&gt;All of that can translate to eye-popping dollar signs: the chipmaker just announced &lt;a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/988/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-financial"&gt;its Q4 and full-year 2020 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s adding billions of dollars wherever you look: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1Y1AV"&gt;$3.2 billion in revenue this quarter, up 53 percent from $2.1 billion last quarter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zBjfDa"&gt;$1.78 billion in profit this quarter, up 948 percent from $170 million last quarter*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pNWbi5"&gt;$9.76 billion in revenue this past year, up 45 percent from $6.7 billion in 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQwDta"&gt;$2.49 billion in profit this past year, up 630 percent from $341 million in 2019*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EEYNDm"&gt;AMD says it’s a new revenue record for the company, despite previously saying it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238431/amd-q1-2020-quarterly-profit-results-demand-ryzen-radeon"&gt;expected weakened demand in the second half of the year&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgm4Nc"&gt;The big dollar signs don’t all represent consumer-grade chips, of course, as the company has its fingers in many silicon pies, but more than half of its quarterly revenue came from its Computing and Graphics segment, which was “up 18 percent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by strong sales of Ryzen processors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="674tOw"&gt;We’ll update this post if there are any intriguing details on the earnings call, particularly about when we can expect the company’s desktop CPUs and GPUs to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;less hard to find&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvVcid"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Those profits include “a fourth quarter income tax benefit of $1.30 billion associated with a valuation allowance release,” according to the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox, Surface, and cloud once again boost Microsoft’s Q2 earnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZp7AwRZgRk_3XG80Px7RJfEhOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724235/DSCF1189.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SYE6wZ"&gt;Microsoft posted the second quarter of its 2021 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2021-Q2%2Fpress-release-webcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial results today&lt;/a&gt;, reporting revenue of $43.1 billion and a net income of $15.5 billion. Revenue is up 17 percent, and net income has increased by 33 percent. We saw some impressive growth for Surface, Xbox, and cloud-related services in Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537015/microsoft-q1-2021-earnings-revenue-cloud-services-surface-gaming-xbox"&gt;previous quarter&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s very much the same this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2c70jA"&gt;The PC market just had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth in 10 years&lt;/a&gt;, with around 300 million shipments of devices during 2020. The pandemic has impacted the way a lot of people work or learn, and many have turned to laptops to continue remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWC7dr"&gt;Windows OEM non-pro revenue has grown by 24 percent for Microsoft, reflecting the demand from consumers. Windows OEM revenue overall, including pro licenses, grew 1 percent in total, likely because of the strong prior Windows 7 upgrade schedule for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxAZ7zTOgdDPfggxfExPYai5rU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012261/vpavic_4275_20201030_0038.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox consoles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6o8e4Q"&gt;This is the first quarter of sales of Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. While both debuted toward the end of the quarter (November 10th), Microsoft says hardware revenue has grown 86 percent, thanks to the next-gen consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyoCyB"&gt;Xbox content and services revenue has also increased by 40 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Gaming has been incredibly popular throughout 2020, and many have clearly turned to Xbox Game Pass and services like xCloud during the pandemic.  That’s pushed Microsoft’s overall gaming revenue up 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ys0pA"&gt;Over on the Surface side, Microsoft’s updated Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop Go also debuted during this quarter. Surface revenue is up 3 percent, but it’s crucially now a $2 billion business for the first time ever. That’s significant for the long-term health of the Surface business, and it comes during an increased demand for laptops and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co89UH"&gt;Microsoft also just announced an updated Surface Pro 7 Plus device, available only for businesses and schools. The new model includes a bigger battery, Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a removable SSD, and LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4Bu3PIEjsNnyXvEPngSpYt5YMc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250351/akrales_190930_3689_0242.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 3 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mSap9S"&gt;Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers have also increased to 47.5 million, a 28 percent bump. Microsoft has been focusing on Teams and Microsoft 365 services for consumers, launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199376/microsoft-365-subscriptions-office-family-safety-app-teams-features-price"&gt;renewed effort to attract more subscribers&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzsHLY"&gt;Cloud services continue to be a big boost to Microsoft’s revenues, thanks to the general pandemic shift in work and learning behavior. Both Office commercial and consumer are up, with Office 365 Commercial revenue growth up by 21 percent. Server products and cloud services revenue has also increased 26 percent as more businesses rely on cloud services. Azure revenue itself grew 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBPFdn"&gt;“What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. “Building their own digital capability is the new currency driving every organization’s resilience and growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA4ckV"&gt;Microsoft is planning to hold an investor call at 5:30PM ET, and we’ll update this article with any relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nnxuqa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to personalize your Chromebook’s lock screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AISJrcClJCCZsOnxH5XqfSSU96I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724180/bfarsace190331_4355_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n5HKk4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/sign-sites-faster-and-personalize-your-lock-screen/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the latest version of Chrome OS, with a few new features for Chromebook owners to try out. If you’re a Chromebook owner, your device should have the newest version now or very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtX6TY"&gt;First off, your Chromebook can now function as a smart display (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;) when you’re not actively using it. Like the Nest Hub, it can act like a digital photo album and display pictures on its lock screen. You can select a photo album for your screensaver to cycle through or pick from a gallery of preloaded images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7xIWF"&gt;You can now use the lock screen for other smart display tasks as well. For example, you can play and pause music and check the weather without unlocking the Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXND9Q"&gt;To turn on the personalized lock screen feature, go into your Chrome OS settings and Select Personalization &amp;gt; Screen Saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHVF0l"&gt;Another new addition is called Web Authentication, or WebAuthn. This feature will allow you to sign in to certain websites with the PIN or fingerprint that you use to sign in to your Chromebook, rather than with your password for those sites. You can also add WebAuthn as an additional layer of security for two-step verification. Per Google’s blog post, supported websites include Dropbox, GitHub, and Okta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0UUWg"&gt;You don’t need to do anything special to use Web Authentication. When you visit a supported website, you’ll be prompted to switch over.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weeks later, Google still hasn’t added privacy labels to its most popular iPhone apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzPctvSV8YiQYXAm9SHEAoG75is=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724108/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXtLVu"&gt;Three weeks after Google &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/"&gt;promised it would add&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;mandatory app privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; “as soon as this week,” none of the company’s main apps have the labels, including Gmail, search, Photos, Docs, and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0iQFo"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why"&gt;some questions&lt;/a&gt; about whether Google is purposefully not updating its apps to avoid the labels, so I looked through every Google app in the iOS App Store to find out whether the updates have been coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3osQ3"&gt;Some have: 12 apps now have the iOS privacy labels, though they may not be as recognizable as YouTube or Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gKAj5T"&gt;Stadia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XdQIix"&gt;Google Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="soQBP7"&gt;Google Authenticator &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YVGzrT"&gt;Google Play Movies and TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AAsyZg"&gt;Google Classroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZCrBUn"&gt;Google Fiber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mRRzhb"&gt;Google Fiber TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvtfMV"&gt;Wear OS &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MOD0IW"&gt;Onduo for Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aoiajq"&gt;Project Baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RzFkOu"&gt;Google Smart Lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bVMSNq"&gt;Motion Stills - GIF, Collage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr33u1"&gt;Clicking through to the privacy labels, they seem to make sense. Some of the apps, like Google Authenticator, don’t capture much information, while Google Translate and Classroom have a pretty hefty list of privacy notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib4HlP"&gt;Again, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Google is capturing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of that information just from you opening the app. The privacy label just shows all of the things the app &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; capture depending on which features you use. And while you may have to scroll a bit through the list, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;it’s nothing like Facebook’s&lt;/a&gt; seemingly endless list. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qnt-phfeWaP-8lRIs2nozG4u_cM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261080/IMG_CEA0A48C1E43_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The privacy info for Authenticator fits on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="sNBbQT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google promised a while ago that it would start adding privacy labels to its apps on the App Store. They’ve now been added to Google Translate. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aC4jhExywM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aC4jhExywM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1354141738227535872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eehtiU"&gt;There are some oddities, though. “Motion Stills - GIF, Collage” is an app that hasn’t been updated for three years, yet it has the privacy labels. It’s probably fair to say that this wasn't the app we had in mind when Google promised it would start rolling them out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sM9oJ_O1K-n9E7Fr2iPEIopxbyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261053/IMG_0656.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The privacy label for an app that hasn’t been updated in three years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NbTMb3"&gt;Apple launched these privacy labels on December 14th, and companies like Google can no longer update their apps unless they add these privacy labels first. So when some people noticed that Google had stopped updating its apps, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why"&gt;they speculated that it may be to avoid having to admit&lt;/a&gt; how much data it was collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwxizo"&gt;Google has denied that, though, explicitly &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it wasn’t holding back updates and that it was committed to adding the labels when those updates were ready. The company reiterated that promise &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-and-control-your-privacy"&gt;in a privacy-focused blog post&lt;/a&gt; on January 12th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFMT76"&gt;As Google’s iOS apps are updated with new features or to fix bugs, you’ll see updates to our app page listings that include the new App Privacy Details. These labels represent the maximum categories of data that could be collected—meaning if you use every available feature and service in the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qJl2t1"&gt;They are rolling out. It’s just not clear when Google will update its most popular apps — the ones that likely suck up the most user data, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The HomePod mini finally adds its long-promised ultra-wideband handoff feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KUkQeNCTORVzfKiKt_ZCG5ck70=/0x70:2400x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723965/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYySHV"&gt;Apple has officially released iOS 14.4 and a matching update for its HomePod mini speaker, adding the long-promised ultra-wideband (UWB) handoff feature that will allow newer iPhones to more seamlessly transfer music, calls, and podcasts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2eY2ea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A5Dljp"&gt;While both the original HomePod and the HomePod mini have supported handing off music for some time, the smaller device features a U1 ultra-wideband chip that promises to make it even easier to transfer content over from an iPhone 12 or iPhone 11 device. The new U1-enhanced functionality also adds additional features, including new visual and haptic feedback. The U1-based system also will give the option to show listening suggestions when you bring your phone close and display media controls on your iPhone without requiring you to unlock it first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcqyfR"&gt;The ultra-wideband handoff feature was originally showcased when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21432979/apple-homepod-mini-features-specs-price"&gt;HomePod mini was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t included with the original release. Instead, Apple promised that it would be available later in 2020 (a deadline that the company has slightly missed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvIuOt"&gt;To take advantage of the new update, you’ll need a HomePod mini that’s been updated to the latest software, along with a U1-equipped iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 device that’s running iOS 14.4. The original HomePod isn’t compatible with the new functionality, though, due to its lack of a U1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 75-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K TV is cheaper than ever</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hP9EX8"&gt;Vizio’s P-Series Quantum X remains the company’s flagship line of QLED televisions. If you are in the market for a new TV and have room to fit a 75-inch device on your entertainment station, Vizio’s P75Qx-H1 model is $1,600 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730535517442483650" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1612716-REG%2Fvizio_p75qx_h1_p_series_quantum_x_75.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Ftv%2Fp-series%2FP75QX-H1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250776%2Fizio-p-series-quantum-4k-hdr-tv-deal-sale-ps5-xbox#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vizio&lt;/a&gt;. This is $400 off its usual price and the lowest we have seen this TV go for yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0bJvE"&gt;Released last fall, the P-Series Quantum X TVs can hit up to 3000 nits of peak brightness and support a variable refresh rate ranging from 48Hz to 120Hz at up to 4K resolution. Additionally, they feature 384 local dimming zones for great contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pshWo3"&gt;There are two HDMI 2.1 ports on the side and two HDMI 2.0 ports at the bottom. With HDMI 2.1 support, gamers will be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308026/vizio-2021-p-series-quantum-x-m-v-4k-hdr-tv-prices-specs"&gt;take full advantage&lt;/a&gt; of their PS5, Xbox Series X, or gaming PC, especially if their device is equipped with the latest Nvidia RTX graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iJybhI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OjaTdy"&gt;Of course, this is a pretty big TV, so if you don’t have room for something this size but are still interested in a Vizio P-Series, you can grab the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/1/23/22244136/super-bowl-2021-tv-deal-sale-samsung-galaxy-s21-preorder"&gt;65-inch model for $1,200 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is opening up its full tweet archive to academic researchers for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwzWEac3lDv9Fls_5_cZS3CPVKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723365/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V3gBCP"&gt;Twitter on Tuesday announced a significant shift in the type of data it makes available for free to third-party academic researchers interested in studying user behaviors and trends related to online discourse. Now, Twitter says it will no longer require researchers pay for premium or enterprise developer access and will instead make the “full history of public conversation” — what the company refers to as its full-archive search endpoint — available to any researcher or developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic research track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83HTrd"&gt;The change is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve the Twitter API, the set of tools it makes available for those outside the company to build something on top of Twitter or use its mountains of data for research studies. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;launched its new and improved API last summer&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make amends with the developer and research communities, both of which have often found themselves at odds with the platform’s continuous and sometimes adversarial product development over the years. This contentious relationship began most notably in 2012, when Twitter decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3263481/twitter-api-third-party-developers"&gt;cut off key developer access to the platform&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stricter control over what data it let potential competitors use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDe1qs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MjvWQ"&gt;Twitter acknowledges the less-than-ideal relationship it’s had with the developer and research communities. “Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need, and many have had to rely on their own resourcefulness to find the right information. Despite this, for over a decade, academic researchers have used Twitter data for discoveries and innovations that help make the world a better place,” write product managers Adam Tornes and Leanne Trujillo in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2021/enabling-the-future-of-academic-research-with-the-twitter-api.html"&gt;blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBMDCn"&gt;Tornes and Trujillo point to steps Twitter has taken in the past year to improve its tools, including the release of a COVID-19 endpoint for free and a beta of the new academic research track to gather proper feedback ahead of today’s public launch. And the company is making a concerted effort to convince researchers it wants to help them, especially now that social media discourse has become more crucial in understanding online misinformation, election interference, hate speech, and other topics that took center stage during and after the 2020 US election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07L7Em"&gt;In addition to opening up its public archive, Twitter says it’s also giving approved applicants a higher monthly tweet volume cap of 10 million tweets, which is 20 times higher than what was available on the standard free track before. It’s also allowing more precise filtering to help researchers pinpoint tweets and other data relevant to what they’re studying and “new technical and methodological guides” for helping researchers find what they’re looking for and better make use of it in studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InpZt0"&gt;Twitter says interested academics and developers can apply to the new academic research  track on the company’s &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case"&gt;developer website&lt;/a&gt;. The track will, however, come with some limitations. For now, the company is now opening up access to independent researchers or journalists. You’ll have to be a student or part of an academic institution. Twitter also says it will be not be providing access to data from accounts that have been suspended or banned, which could complicate efforts to study hate speech, misinformation, and other types of conversations that violate Twitter rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWeL1x"&gt;This also means that the account @realDonaldTrump is also not accessible through Twitter’s archive following US social media sites’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;widespread deplatforming of Trump following the deadly US Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Trump’s tweets are archived online through his &lt;a href="https://www.trumplibrary.gov/"&gt;official presidential library&lt;/a&gt;, while independent websites and database tools like &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;The Trump Twitter Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Politwoops&lt;/a&gt; have also been preserving the former president’s tweets, included the deleted ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT2XhI"&gt;“We’ve heard a lot of interest from the academic research community in studying @realDonaldTrump,” Trujillo said during a call with reporters on Monday. “We’re having conversations internally about how we might give thoughtful consideration to the study of this topic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUe7X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more information around access to suspended or banned accounts and former President Donald Trump’s tweets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
