    <title>The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XqMAWD"&gt;This week was supposed to be the first day of Google’s big reentry into flagship smartwatches. Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;back on board&lt;/a&gt; after years of Tizen-based wearables, with its new Galaxy Watch 4 that runs the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;new, revitalized Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the smartwatch OS that merges the best of Google and Samsung’s discrete platforms together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVOqm0"&gt;But there was just one issue: Google was strangely absent from the proceedings. In fact, aside from a few oblique mentions of working with Google on the software, you might have watched Samsung’s whole presentation and not even caught that the new watches were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617462/galaxy-watch-4-classic-samsung-apple-watch-google-ecosystem"&gt;running on Wear OS at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMomM2"&gt;On the one hand, this is extremely par for the course for Samsung. It’s practically a running gag at this point that Samsung goes out of its way to avoid mentioning Google or Android when it discusses its new phone releases. And indeed, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Fold 3 sections were full of praise for Samsung’s One UI, with nary a mention of Android 11 or Android 12 or any improvements Google has been making on an OS level to enable those devices to work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkVlon"&gt;Seeing a similar dynamic here with the Galaxy Watch and Wear OS 3 — one that focused more on Samsung’s One UI improvements and software layer more than anything that the new Google collaboration enables — makes sense given Samsung’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eXHvULW6AqOtYBVmhDfugp7fYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775097/BFARSACE_210810_4707_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jHmkTS"&gt;But the Samsung-heavy announcement highlights just how much of an uphill battle Google has here, and how much it’s going to have to rely on Samsung (which has very different goals than Google) as it looks to revitalize its wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnY7h7"&gt;And it’s hard to look at the Galaxy Watch 4 as anything other than a compromise of a device for Google. It’s a flagship Wear OS 3 watch that runs Samsung’s UI on top, won’t ship with Google Assistant, and comes packed with default apps that compete with Google’s own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azOrQw"&gt;The default health tracking app on Wear OS is Samsung Health. And the default payment app? Samsung Pay. The default assistant? Bixby. The list of default apps goes on: Messages, Photos, Calendar, Clock, Music and more are all Samsung’s version. You can manually install Google’s version of these apps, but it’s a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6FFGJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKR0Bj"&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS5FVh"&gt;And while Samsung is arguably a more selfish partner than Google may have hoped for to relaunch its Wear OS platform, Google also doesn’t have much of a choice. The list of Wear OS partners in 2021 isn’t long or distinguished. Motorola and LG haven’t made smartwatches in years, OnePlus, ​​RealMe, and Oppo are all using their own operating systems, and Fitbit — while now owned by Google — has yet to embrace Google’s operating system at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1TKdE"&gt;In 2021, your best bet for a Wear OS watch is either TicWatch or Fossil, which — while having done an admirable job of trying to carry the platform thus far — aren’t the kind of big name partners on the caliber of Samsung. Neither of those companies looks ready to release a Wear OS 3 watch for some time, either, with Fossil already confirming that its holiday releases will still be stuck on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521256/fossil-not-upgrade-existing-watches-wear-os-google-android"&gt;old Wear OS platform&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;With upgrades coming sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wec2Bj"&gt;There’s added confusion, too: Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, for example, will use Samsung Health for at least some of its fitness services. You can install Google Fit, but it feels like it’s tacked on this watch. And so far as we can tell, you &lt;em&gt;can’t &lt;/em&gt;switch from Samsung Pay to Google Pay or from Bixby to the Google Assistant on this watch. And the Galaxy Watch won’t work with iOS devices, something that Google won’t clarify as limited to just Samsung’s model or a potential limit of all Wear OS 3 watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6baD32"&gt;So what does Google get out of the Galaxy Watch? Well, at the end of the day, the new Wear OS-powered Galaxy Watch &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; on Google’s OS and does rely on critical Google services like the Play Store for apps. It’s more compatible with non-Samsung Android phones and will work with Google services like Maps and Gmail (even if some of those will have to face Samsung-branded competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FUINJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the end of the day, every new Galaxy Watch is also a new Wear OS user&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXbH0a"&gt;Additionally, the Wear OS smartwatch market is still pretty stagnant right now, so it’s not like Google has anything to lose by letting Samsung do a heavily Samsung-focused watch. Anyone who buys into the Galaxy Watch 4 is another user to help bolster the Play Store, and a bigger audience for developers looking to invest in Google’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vProsx"&gt;Plus, with Google’s past investments in smartwatches (a list that includes its $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187026/google-fossil-group-smartwatch-sale-40-million-wear-os-android"&gt;mysterious $40 million acquisition from Fossil&lt;/a&gt; in 2019), it’s possible the current status quo won’t last forever. If Apple and Samsung have shown anything, it’s that sometimes the best way to get a great smartwatch is to just do it yourself — and the upcoming Pixel 6 seems like it could use a matching high-end smartwatch to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOPGbyTORkiB8KxGywbOOR323zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777959/HONOR_Magic3_Blue_Hour.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Honor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 (left) and the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoTYks"&gt;The Magic 3 Pro and Pro Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, while the standard Magic 3 has a Snapdragon 888 processor. Around front they have a 6.76-inch 1344p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an aggressive curve around the sides of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsGfu"&gt;Rear cameras vary significantly between the three phones. On the standard Magic 3, there are three cameras: a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch main camera, a 13-megapixel 1/1.31-inch ultrawide, and a 64-megapixel monochrome camera. The Magic 3 Pro adds a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, 3.5x optical zoom, and OIS. Finally, the Pro Plus increases the size of the main 50-megapixel sensor to 1/1.28-inches, and the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 64 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EqMgk"&gt;The Magic 3 Series has a battery capacity of 4,600mAh and supports wired fast-charging up to 66W. On the Pro and Pro Plus, there’s wireless charging up to 50W with support for reverse wireless charging, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (the regular Magic 3 has an IP54 rating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnl29"&gt;The announcement of the Honor Magic 3 series follows the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;V40 in January&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 in June&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite confirming that the Honor 50 will eventually receive a global release, complete with Google’s apps and services, an exact release date is yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxYSiU"&gt;The Honor Magic 3 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for €899 (about $1,055), while the Magic 3 Pro with the same configuration of RAM and storage will cost €1,099 (about $1,290). The Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, will cost €1,499 (about $1,760). The exact date of the phones’ global release is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 65t are just $50 at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTHZAWQmgqUG-S6ZdWa3NODcdX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714831/akrales_180411_2462_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With decent sound and a stable connection, the Elite 65t were once our go-to alternative to the AirPods. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="synnAq"&gt;It seems like the market for true wireless earbuds becomes more and more crowded each week, with products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; being two of the latest contenders to jump into the already-burgeoning field. And while the Jabra Elite 65t are beginning to show their age in comparison and are by no means top of the field, they’re still a great pair of earbuds with enjoyable sound and a customizable fit, not to mention a two-year warranty that covers any potential damage they may sustain from prolonged exposure to sweat or dust. Normally $80, you can pick up the copper-black model at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-copper-black%2F6230036.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBRJYTkExnTRM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6230036&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $50&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247354/jabra-elite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review-airpods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LsZ8di"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJtr6U"&gt;When talking TV recommendations with the rest of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff, there’s one model that seems to come up more often than any other: the LG C1. It’s not particularly surprising, however, especially since the 4K OLED is the successor to the LG CX, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs you can buy for the PS5 or Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Every configuration of the C1 offers support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies and comes with a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, and HDR. It also has a faster processor than the CX and a gamer-friendly interface that lets you quickly toggle between various settings without having to delve deep into the settings pane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaN1ct"&gt;If you don’t mind sticking with a smaller panel, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLG-C1PU-48-HDR-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-OLED-TV-2021-Model-%2F184898835257%3F_trksid%3D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals081221%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22620961%2Fjabra-elite-65t-earbuds-lg-c1-48-inch-oled-anker-nintendo-switch-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for an additional $100 off at eBay&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE20FORBTS&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing the final sale price down to just $1,197.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFbsD2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZM0Kg"&gt;The Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite are great consoles when it comes to portability, but keeping either console juiced on the go can prove challenging, especially if you’re using an older Switch model that doesn’t offer the same kind of battery life as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; or forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;OLED edition&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where a device like Anker’s PowerCore 13400 Powerbank can prove handy. The compact, Nintendo-licensed battery pack — which is currently &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2rQzAA"&gt;on sale at Adorama for $30&lt;/a&gt; — provides nearly enough power to charge the standard Switch twice over and can be used with a range of other USB-C devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U58DcO"&gt;Reddit, the self-declared ‘front page of the internet,’ says it is now &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/08/12/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/"&gt;valued at more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; after raising an additional $410 million in funding, with the final round expected to grow to up to $700 million. The company continues to build and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364019/reddit-bans-racist-subreddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-twitter-thread"&gt;sanitize its business&lt;/a&gt;, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="574zEp"&gt;“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “All good companies should go public when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4LUZJ"&gt;The company previously raised $250 million in funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274077/reddit-funding-round-250-million-double-employees-investment"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the company was approached with this recent financing round by Fidelity Investments and were made “an offer that we couldn’t refuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNSnzp"&gt;Reddit makes most its money from advertising on the site, and although it’s a minnow compared to the likes of Facebook and Google, it’s growing its business quickly. The company says it made $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2021, up 192 percent compared to the same period last year. Though for context, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;made $61.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; in this year’s second quarter, mostly from YouTube and Search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlauzM"&gt;Reddit now has roughly 52 million daily users (compared to 1.85 billion daily Facebook users) and more than 100,000 active sub-reddits. Earlier this year, the company said it planned to double its staff count by the end of 2021 to around 1,400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEQfU"&gt;Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the new funding would be used to make the site easier for first-time users and help its communities expand internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-08-12T06:36:28-04:00</updated>
    <title>Google Meet users have more options to add co-hosts, limit screen sharing, and mute others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsy-EcbVP9_BlHit8lD1XT7MNFc=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714425/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svljGT"&gt;Google is adding a bunch of &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;new features to Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for users to control and direct meetings. However, exactly which controls will be available depends on whether you are using Meet as a regular user or as part of a Google Workspace team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKoHZC"&gt;The main update is that all users will now be able to assign up to 25 co-hosts per meeting, who will have access to host controls. This will let them limit who can share their screen and send chat messages, as well as mute all participants with a single click, end the meeting, and control who can enter the meeting (though this last feature is only available to certain Google Workspace versions). Previously, assigning co-hosts was only available to Google Workspace for Education customers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXSv181Esl0gLcE6zfIxIovPFmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777885/host2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hosts can assign other call participants as co-hosts by clicking the three-dot menu next to their name&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEisbB"&gt;Google Meet is also getting new Quick Access settings if you’re a Google Workspace customer. This will be enabled by default, but if it’s turned off, it means meetings won’t be able to start until the host joins. Users can also do things like block anonymous users from joining or only let invited participants join without asking — ensuring only people who are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be in a meeting are actually in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4qXfy"&gt;The changes are scheduled to roll out on web and Android from August 16th and on iOS from August 30th. For full details of the changes and availability based on different Workplace versions, check out the blog post from Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Wear OS app is getting offline playback in the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_d13u-UaD3xsRI6anxOz-YpYVo=/591x0:1416x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714396/Spotify_wearOS_banner01_1_1440x550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNFepC"&gt;Spotify’s updated Wear OS app is releasing “over the coming weeks,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-11/enjoy-all-your-music-and-podcasts-offline-on-smartwatches-running-wear-os/"&gt;Spotify has announced&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll support offline playback on smartwatches running Wear OS 2.0 and up. The new functionality was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; alongside the news of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google’s collaboration with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; on the next-generation of the wearable operating system, Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUFVtq"&gt;The fact that offline downloads will be available on Wear OS 2 means that it’s not exclusive to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches like Samsung’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says it should work on watches from the likes of Fossil, Mobvoi, and Suunto. Meanwhile Google’s new YouTube Music Wear OS app, which also supports offline listening, is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;exclusive to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1RM7Y"&gt;Similar to Spotify’s offline listening on the Apple Watch, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;launched in May&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need a Premium subscription to use the feature. Spotify says you’ll be able to download music or podcasts by hitting the “Download to watch” button in the Wear OS app. A small green arrow will appear next to a playlist, album, or podcast once it’s available for listening offline. Free users will be able to download podcasts directly to the watch for offline playback, but when it comes to music they’ll have to stream in shuffle mode over Wi-Fi or cellular. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warhammer’s new subscription streaming service is coming to iOS, Android, and smart TVs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gt_N9DpOPPvzY_uSo-x0vreyp7M=/0x24:1500x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714336/WH40K_GuillimanvsBlackLegion2018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, takes on the Black Legion. | Image: Games Workshop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eaIsRk"&gt;Games Workshop is preparing to launch Warhammer Plus, a niche subscription streaming service for fans of the sprawling, lore-dense Warhammer universe (or rather, universes: the sci-fi world of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt;, and fantasy setting of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/08/11/warhammer-is-packed-with-amazing-shows-and-features-heres-how-youll-access-them-all/"&gt;company now says&lt;/a&gt; Warhammer Plus will not only be available on iOS and Android through a number of dedicated apps, but also on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCJtCl"&gt;The launch comes at a rather awkward time for Games Workshop, given that some fans are currently boycotting the firm after a recent change to its intellectual property policy. &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/em&gt; in particular has an extremely vocal and active fanbase (check out &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdank/"&gt;r/Grimdank&lt;/a&gt; for a taste) that produce memes, cosplays, and fan animations. But Games Workshop recently said &lt;a href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-WW/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines"&gt;it is now taking&lt;/a&gt; a “zero tolerance” approach to unauthorized uses of its IP, meaning fan films “are only to be created under licence from Games Workshop.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmdYazRUrkMiNe7EeBIKRmOfbSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777862/hmLRvMup5WPBKx67.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Games Workshop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The service is launching August 25th. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsZxdA"&gt;The change &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4j3/warhammer-40k-fans-in-revolt-over-zero-tolerance-fan-animation-policy"&gt;understandably angered a lot of fans&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when popular creator Bruva Alfabussa shut down his long-running &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyiDf91_bTEgnBN0jAvzNbqzrlMGID5WA"&gt;YouTube show&lt;/a&gt;, If The Emperor Had a Text-To-Speech Device, rather than face potential legal repercussions. It seems like a bit of a self-defeating move for Games Workshop, considering how the work of fans helps to draw people into Warhammer, and ultimately buy its tabletop figures and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl0aM8"&gt;It’s also hard not to draw a line between the change in policy and the new Warhammer Plus streaming service, which includes a number of new animation series. Though, despite the annoyance of same fans, many admit the service seems like decent value for money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1yAye"&gt;For $5.99 / £4.99 a month (or $59.99 / £49.99 a year), subscribers will get access to a swathe of content, including a free miniature, which would cost upwards of $30 by itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IuVqOb"&gt;TV shows like &lt;em&gt;Citadel Colour Masterclass&lt;/em&gt; for teaching model painting techniques, &lt;em&gt;Loremasters&lt;/em&gt; to dive into official Warhammer lore, and &lt;em&gt;Battle Report&lt;/em&gt;, which follows tournament-style tabletop battles in the Warhammer TV studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FvxDxm"&gt;Animations like &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/04/08/a-new-angels-of-death-trailer-is-here-and-its-crawling-with-cultists/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/03/18/hammer-and-bolter-spectacular-new-screenshots-from-the-animated-anthology/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hammer and Bolter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BYLRNO"&gt;Premium access to the games’ official companion apps, Warhammer 40,000: The App and Warhammer Age of Sigmar, which include rulebooks, FAQs, and the Battle Forge army builder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l0GQWU"&gt;The Warhammer Vault, which includes official novelizations and the whole back catalogue of &lt;em&gt;White Dwarf&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e08UwH"&gt;A free exclusive miniature, with subscribers able to choose from a Vindicare Assassin or an Orruk Megaboss, with the option to buy the other later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrIrCPI6QOxXNSw6jiIJ8VNhUUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777865/warhammer_plus_minis.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Games Workshop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Vindicare Assassin (left) and Orruk Megaboss (right) miniatures, available exclusively for Warhammer Plus subscribers. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cYiyCK"&gt;The irony is that Warhammer Plus will &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22451632/warhammer-plus-streaming-service-animations-previews-trailer"&gt;also include an animation series&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Astartes&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/11/22325655/warhammer-40k-animation-announcement-astartes-follow-up-exodite-primaris-lost-templar-iron-within"&gt;started life as a fan animation&lt;/a&gt;, shared on YouTube and racking up millions of views, before Games Workshop offered its creator, Syama Pedersen, a job. By stifling such fan creativity in the future, is the company shooting itself in the foot with a bolter? If so, it’ll definitely lose the leg. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s new focus mode could keep students from distracting each other</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzV_MaSwms1V28pRwGWiMWiEYeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713469/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S7VKng"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/back-to-school-hybrid-learning/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Focus mode, &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;which it says&lt;/a&gt; is meant to keep students from getting distracted while in a virtual classroom, while still allowing the teacher to keep an eye on everybody. When activated, Focus mode will make it so that a meeting’s participants won’t be able to see each other’s videos or screen shares, while the host is still able to see everyone’s webcams. It provides some of the control &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004834466#h_01EYVHFHQMD1G3YSZB8TNG9E8P"&gt;found in Webinar mode&lt;/a&gt;, without the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/when-to-use-meetings-vs-webinars/"&gt;complexity and lack of flexibility&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it — for instance, a teacher could turn on Focus mode while presenting, and then turn it off when it’s time for a class discussion. And, while &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing%2Fwebinar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F11%2F22620822%2Fzoom-virtual-learning-classes-focus-mode-teachers-students" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting a Webinar costs money&lt;/a&gt;, Focus mode appears to be available to free accounts, based on my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1xRV6"&gt;This feature comes as the new school year approaches in many districts, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains serious. It seems likely that virtual classrooms are going to be sticking around for some, so it’s good that Zoom is adding features to improve tele-learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="73Epe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10697320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeOgR3"&gt;While focus mode will put the teacher’s video or screen share front-and-center for students, it won’t be the only thing on their screens. For one, participants will still see their own video, as well as any videos or screen shares that are spotlighted by the host. They’ll also be able to see the names of the other participants, as well as any emoji reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtOMkG"&gt;Overall, the feature seems like a decent way to keep students from distracting each other during class, and could even have its uses outside of a learning environment (say, during company presentations, if managers are worried about employees not paying attention to slides). Zoom’s &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;Focus mode support article&lt;/a&gt; says that the feature can be enabled or locked on for accounts, groups, or individual users. After turning it on for your account the feature can be accessed by clicking the More button while in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three more high-profile Blizzard employees are no longer at the company, including Diablo 4’s director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjXMsgkIv764ZBXBfVWH6XZo38A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712748/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b7HR2"&gt;Three prominent Blizzard employees have been let go from the company, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113?rev=1628715951359"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marking the latest departures from the studio following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;major sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the state of California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; designer Jonathan LeCraft are not employed at Blizzard anymore, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku. &lt;/em&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed the departures in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we published this story, but declined to comment on whether or not Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft were fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEkZX"&gt;“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,” a Blizzard spokesperson said. “We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i8pI2d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McCree is the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in Overwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdyxvL"&gt;Activision Blizzard has not shared why they are no longer at the company, according to a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; source. McCree appears to be one of the people photographed inside Blizzard’s so-called “Cosby Suite,” in a screenshot &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared to participate in the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew” chat. McCree is also the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch;&lt;/em&gt; Michael Chu, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21174947/overwatch-lead-writer-michael-chu-leaves-blizzard"&gt;the game’s former lead writer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lPXKBFXS3wk?t=146"&gt;revealed in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the real-life McCree had to “sign over his name” to the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team because they liked it for the gunslinging character more than many other ideas. (Some&lt;em&gt; Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League casters have &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/overwatch-league-casters-mccree-name/"&gt;avoided saying McCree’s name on air&lt;/a&gt;.) LeCraft was also pictured in the Cosby Suite, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku’s&lt;/em&gt; new story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi17ju"&gt;We asked if Blizzard plans to change McCree’s name in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and the company said it’s checking into it. It’s possible the company might do so: days after the lawsuit hit, Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team promised to remove &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;“references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/references-to-alex-afrasiabi-removed-in-world-of-warcraft-323588"&gt;already removed a variety of &lt;em&gt;WoW &lt;/em&gt;in-game references to Alex Afrasiabi.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsqOZ3"&gt;Afrasiabi was a former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director who was singled out in the lawsuit for his behavior, and Blizzard &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it fired Afrasiabi for “his misconduct in his treatment of other employees.” He appears to have worked for the company &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alex-afrasiabi-whered-he-go-o/749539"&gt;until June 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHjg5a"&gt;The departures of Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft follow the ones by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;former Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, who was named in the lawsuit, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;former SVP of HR Jesse Meschuk&lt;/a&gt;. Employees walked out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;in late July&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s response to the lawsuit, and a shareholder released a letter on Tuesday saying the company’s response doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;“go nearly far enough.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L54Fwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 11th, 7:35PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Blizzard and relevant context about another fired Blizzard executive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors pivots to renting space at former GM factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TozUNnhFg8VJhskK8KZ2yqY2dUA=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713084/1232963726.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NapJL"&gt;Lordstown Motors is looking to essentially loan out some space at the massive former General Motors factory it owns, as the troubled startup gets closer to building its first production-quality Endurance pickup trucks later this year. Interim CEO Angela Strand shared Wednesday that Lordstown is in “serious discussions... with several potential partners” who may build vehicles or do other types of work at the plant alongside the startup — meaning the startup could act like a sort of WeWork for manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EI0aA"&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us, a decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities for Lordstown at the same time as production of the Endurance is ramping up,” Strand said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf5LP7"&gt;“Our current footprint utilizes about 30 percent of the plant’s 6.2 million square feet, so we have ample room for potential partners to build vehicles, for us to build vehicles for others, and for additional [Lordstown Motors] vehicle platforms” to be built, president Rich Schmidt added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aNAC0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxa9FV"&gt;Strand and Schmidt shared the plan on a call with investors where the company discussed its &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;second quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors, which said in June that it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt; will run out of cash by May 2022 without additional funding&lt;/a&gt;, lost $108 million in the quarter. The company was recently &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lordstown-motors-strikes-stock-sale-agreement-with-hedge-fund-271627309034"&gt;buoyed by an equity purchase agreement with a hedge fund&lt;/a&gt; which could allow it to raise up to $400 million. But the startup is still looking to raise more funding as it heads towards an announced September start date for production of the Endurance, and it won’t make money on those vehicles until they start shipping in early 2022 (which is around the same time that Ford’s competing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; is set to ship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsHdD6"&gt;Those funding efforts include the plan to allow other companies to use the factory, as well as finding strategic partners and investors, and raising debt financing. Strand — who struck a five-month, $500,000 &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921085206/tm2119909d2_8k.htm"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with Lordstown to captain the ship while it searches for a permanent CEO — said that the startup is in talks with a number of companies and potential lenders but declined to name any. She also said Lordstown Motors is working to get a third-party appraisal of the value of the factory, the equipment inside, and the improvements that the startup has made — which could help increase the amount of money Lordstown can borrow against the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHWz8H"&gt;The former GM factory has played an outsized role in the short but tumultuous story of Lordstown Motors. In fact, the company was essentially founded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;with the intent of buying the factory in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2tylTV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former GM plant has played an outsized role in Lordstown Motors’ short history &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2613ZN"&gt;At the time, GM had come under tremendous pressure from then-President Donald Trump for closing the plant (where it once produced the Chevy Cruze). So Lordstown Motors founder Steve Burns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;struck a deal with his former company&lt;/a&gt;, another EV startup called Workhorse, to license intellectual property for an electric pickup truck that was never put into production. GM assisted with the purchase and handed over some equipment. Trump said the deal was “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crXgxU"&gt;Lordstown Motors, which went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company late last year, has since put about $240 million of work into the factory to get it ready to build the electric pickup truck. Workhorse was even considering using Lordstown Motors as &lt;a href="https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/report-us-postal-service-contract-could-mean-800m-for-lordstown-motors-2782744"&gt;a manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; if it won the contract to build the next-generation United States Postal Service mail truck (before the award &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;went to defense contractor Oshkosh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99rBVZ"&gt;But Lordstown Motors stumbled earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;Hindenburg Research published a report&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Burns had misled investors about how many preorders the startup had collected for the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bTR9f"&gt;Burns has since resigned, along with a number of other executives and employees close to him, and the startup is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Lordstown Motors subsequently narrowed its plans for initial production, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;stopped work on a second vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — an electric van — that was supposed to be part of a partnership with Camping World. This week, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;sold 72 percent of the stake it acquired&lt;/a&gt; in Lordstown Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVJ16D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI8b36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUJYf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
