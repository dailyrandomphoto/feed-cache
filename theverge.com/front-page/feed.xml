    <title>Why Theranos failed, but other researchers might not</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ug967aRZaF48U4qyb7CriMrScaQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330156/ep2_v12_notext.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljdqhx"&gt;Jurors are still deliberating over the fate of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of defunct biotech company Theranos. They’re deciding if she intentionally misled investors, patients, and doctors about what her company’s blood testing technology could do. Because despite big promises, the tech the company claimed to have invented... didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCZgub"&gt;And the technology might &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be a reality — at least not in the way Holmes described it. In this episode of our three-part series on Theranos, we look at what researchers actually think is possible in the field of blood testing and what the future could look like.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes are among the latest to abandon in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany on January 5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfckIt"&gt;While it’s a late scratch compared to some other announcements, it’s not the only featured exhibitor recently announcing a change of plans, as IBM also said it will forgo in-person appearances. In a statement, an IBM spokesperson says, “Due to the evolving COVID conditions - and out of an abundance of caution - IBM has recently decided not to participate on-site in Las Vegas this year. We do still look forward to participating virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTeSB"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that fellow German automaker Mercedes-Benz is going to skip the in-person event as well, while &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says Panasonic, which usually has a massive central hall booth, is also out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u0NUAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wfe0FL"&gt;Some companies had already reduced their presence at the show over safety concerns. Over the last few years, BMW has had a significant showing at CES in recent years, demonstrating cars around the outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center while also showcasing innovative demos inside, like at the last pre-pandemic show in 2020 where attendees could customize their own concept car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjwSg"&gt;This year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43494/bmw-will-show-car-paint-that-changes-color-with-the-touch-of-a-button-at-ces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports BMW said it would have a car with color-changing paint, while &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/12/15/bmw-theater-screen-ces-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we should also expect to see a new Theater Screen that “really gives an immersive, cinematic experience in the vehicle” that could launch in high-end models like the 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuXmmH"&gt;Mercedes will continue with &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-bb71195b68ec7523e1b4dfa8cc0e738b-digital-world-premiere-of-the-vision-eqxx-the-most-efficient-mercedes-benz-ever"&gt;an all-digital premiere of its new Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says is “the most efficient vehicle the brand has ever built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20hoUH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nE3F6H"&gt;As of Thursday, LG, Sony, and Samsung told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were still planning to attend in person. CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink: BMW and Mercedes are out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.” The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txgm6L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google: “we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;Chipmaking giant Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19'"&gt;said on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt; that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.” Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it’s pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GlLye"&gt;The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, but now that has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr5Yi4"&gt;A statement from the company says, “We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHR3zT"&gt;GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1474130973923033117"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyortL"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, “After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUKJbt"&gt;With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-cancels-ces-2022-attendance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it issued the following statement: “AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsNQ3"&gt;Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948"&gt;says in a post on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgEruz"&gt;OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quKYwk"&gt;As of Thursday, December 30th, BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes also confirmed they will not attend CES 2022 in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq0giq"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;The day after that, the CTA said it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykL0Nr"&gt;As far as why “CES will and must go on,” CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “ CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:56AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla recalls nearly half a million Model 3 and Model S cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM6CgRRzS6zGu_Q_oaqOqcfhJJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330039/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O7CdKE"&gt;Tesla has issued voluntary recalls for nearly half a million vehicles to address potential failures in its trunk latching systems, &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-recall-models-trunk-crash-issues-51640868026?tesla=y"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Barron’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The recalls apply to &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/RWD#recalls"&gt;all Model 3 units&lt;/a&gt; released between 2017 and 2020, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2015/TESLA/MODEL%252520S%25252070D/5%252520HB/AWD#recalls"&gt;certain Model S units&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUoHyZ"&gt;For the Model 3, Tesla believes the opening and closing of the trunk could damage the cable harness attaching the rearview camera, causing the camera to unexpectedly fail. The Model S issue is more serious, potentially preventing the front trunk from fully latching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibkiQh"&gt;According to documents submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are 475,318 vehicles subject to the recall, comprising 356,309 Model 3 vehicles and 119,109 Model S vehicles. Tesla estimates that only 1 percent of the Model 3 vehicles will actually display the defect, compared to 14 percent of the recalled Model S vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFOGCq"&gt;The Model S recall is particularly concerning because the issue affects the front trunk, which could obstruct the driver’s view of the road if it flies open while driving. In the affected Model S cars, “the front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging,” Tesla told NHTSA in an official filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCXZEs"&gt;Since the Model S problem is a misalignment rather than a damaged component, Tesla believes that repositioning the latch device at a service center will resolve the issue. For affected Model 3 owners, Tesla has pledged to install a new cable harness and guide protector free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s photo-focused Xperia 1 III is down to its best price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_CxeZ8k2x_ygSDoZL6IeEn4TEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330017/ajohnson_210712_4667_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjDaKo"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 1 III has a few things that other flagship phones don’t, including a near-4K, 120Hz OLED display, along with plenty of high-quality manual photo and video controls, dual front-facing speakers, and a headphone jack. And yet, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; it — mostly due to its high $1,300 cost. Though, today’s deal on the phone makes the price just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;more digestible. For only the second time since it launched during the summer, Sony’s unlocked Xperia 1 III smartphone has returned to its all-time low price of $1,198 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xperia-III-Smartphone-6-5-21/dp/B091YC2SJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsox1m3.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeSonyExperia1III123021"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5b51"&gt;For context, that’s around the same price as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; and even cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent storage capacity. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjekA7kR3O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has the smartphone on sale for $1,199.99, yet the retailer is also throwing in a free Microsoft 365 trial and a 50 percent discount on an Ultra Mobile SIM kit, if those things matter to you. For those impressed enough by the promise of the phone’s screen and its excellent photo and video-shooting capabilities, this could be a great chance to snag the device before the price goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0X7Mpr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10952660"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8EWbh0"&gt;Lenovo’s excellent Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop is selling at a great price over at Antonline. While it costs around &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-7-16GB-RAM-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-512GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Gray-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals123021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,850 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (it’s rarely in stock for its $1,530 MSRP, unfortunately), &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Lenovo/Computers/Computer_Systems/Notebooks/1436996" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $1,489.99 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, and the value is tough to beat for this price. This model has a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display at QHD Plus resolution, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip (with a total graphics power of 130W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Basically, it’s a stacked machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; this laptop in 2021, praising its performance and specs for the price. He even went as far as to refer to it as “Lenovo’s best gaming laptop yet.” The Legion 5 Pro also impressed with its typing experience and the amount of ports available. It’s tough to find a laptop that’s this powerful for under $1,800. For context, it’s about as capable as Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eMvXUc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10843973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XEemS"&gt;Looking to warm up your home while saving a bit of money on heating costs? Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQT85FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the Ecobee SmartThermostat for $199&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), matching its Black Friday price. The smart thermostat features a touchscreen display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; was more responsive and easier to navigate than the one on its predecessor. It also supports voice controls and flexible scheduling, and it includes an external temperature sensor that will help maintain comfort in remote rooms. This smart thermostat offers support for HomeKit and Siri and is also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, and SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6TBezw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCqQ3a"&gt;One of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best SSDs compatible with the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; recently dropped to its lowest price to date. Normally $229.99, B&amp;amp;H Photo is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1593680-REG%2Fsamsung_mz_v8p1t0b_am_1tb_980_pro_pcie.html%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F30%2F22858521%2Fsony-xperia-1-iii-smartphone-apple-airpods-max-ecobee-smart-thermostat-samsung-980-pro-ssd-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s lightning-quick 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD for $149.99&lt;/a&gt; (discount applies at checkout). That’s $80 off one of the few drives out there that meets Sony’s performance requirements for its latest console, assuming you have a heatsink like &lt;a href="https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-m-2-nvme-heatsink-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EKWB’s EK-M2 NVMe&lt;/a&gt; to pair with it. This M.2 SSD also works with PC, but you need to have a compatible motherboard to enjoy its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds. Otherwise, it’ll still work but at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8LQq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXP5LD"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to headphones, you still have four days left to snag a set of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 for their lowest price to date. Regularly $149.99, Woot is selling the true wireless earbuds — which come with support for active noise cancellation — for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealRoundup122921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt; through January 3rd. Note, however, that these don’t come with Samsung’s one-year warranty but rather a 90-day warranty through Woot. Think twice about this. We’ve seen the price at other retailers dipping down to around $110, but Woot’s deal might be the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMhK4"&gt;After reviewing them, my colleague Chris Welch was impressed by their audio quality as well as their small, discreet design. In fact, these wireless earbuds are easily some of Samsung’s smallest and lightest yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96Zafn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jBFpoG"&gt;Some other good deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PlZUg3"&gt;If you need a new power adapter, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy Apple’s official 20W USB-C adapter for $15.69&lt;/a&gt; instead of $19 at Amazon, its lowest price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zUwfxE"&gt;A few of Oculus’ must-have accessories for the Quest 2 headset are still discounted, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap at $39&lt;/a&gt; (usually $49) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard zip-up case for $39&lt;/a&gt; (also normally $49).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IISEE3"&gt;You can reserve a pair of the AirPods Max at Micro Center &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/632264/apple-airpods-max-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-space-gray" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re currently only available for in-store pickup in select regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6rWSSG"&gt;Amazon is discounting the Eve Energy Strip, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Energy-Strip-overvoltage-overcurrent/dp/B07PX57RH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling it for an all-time low of $79.96&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. The Eve Energy Strip makes it easy to independently control three power outlets via Siri, an app, or using a handful of other devices while at home or away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peXUTj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjfrEqT5DB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling Razer’s Basilisk v2 wired gaming mouse for $34.99 instead of $79.99. The latter is also offering a $10 discount on Microsoft’s PC Game Pass with your purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some great ways to tweak your new PC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SwVdsW"&gt;This year marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;the launch of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Stock permitting, there are a variety of PCs and laptops available with Microsoft’s new operating system, and while the updated Microsoft Store fills out with apps, we figured we’d put together a list of our 11 favorite apps for a new Windows 11 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRkdgf"&gt;We’re covering productivity, gaming, and media playback, so there should be an app for everyone here. There are even some options to bring back Windows 10 functionality if you’re missing some of the features and customizations Windows used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i0xzk2"&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EarTrumpet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxAAgsaHQAb7t7zSpMRRxMU6Q4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098073/I036YhD.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: File-New-Project&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JW7TDE"&gt;Microsoft’s built-in Windows 11 audio management still isn’t great. EarTrumpet overhauls it completely, with a system tray utility that gives you volume levels for every app and the ability to set custom inputs and outputs for those apps. If you want YouTube to play out of your speakers but prefer that your game audio output on your headset, then this is the app for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GXY64D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925408" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1HcEbi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9WU5dB"&gt;Tweeten&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweeten" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZEk2QIqIieInt5tRWp3p3Au5gE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7696055/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweeten&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cURsfv"&gt;Twitter’s app for Windows is just a web app, and TweetDeck doesn’t even have its own dedicated app. If you’re a fan of TweetDeck, Tweeten gives you TweetDeck on Windows by taking the web interface of TweetDeck and making it a lot more Windows 11-friendly. There are a bunch of customization options and even a notification interface if you want to be alerted to Twitter activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U26kS4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925424" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X9yh1E"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fy6zt4"&gt;FeedLab&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FeedLab" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNuIEr6wguc_9hIwk-Ax2Pg9g8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098076/Jg3Yslv.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ClevLab‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FeedLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCryd"&gt;There are lots of RSS apps available on Windows, but FeedLab is my top pick. I’ve been using this RSS reader ever since Nextgen Reader suddenly stopped working on new PCs. FeedLab has a lot of customization and features for reading your daily list of news, and it’s updated regularly. While the app is free, it’s supported by ads, but they’re easy to remove if you’re willing to support the dev with a one-time ad removal fee that’s essentially the price of a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThMOTy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925442" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ws5uBW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P2iPtb"&gt;PowerToys&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerToys for Windows" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUJ-0tfAwWUhibKp4Eio2FQeCsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19983955/zV54Lfn.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerToys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ms3jZ"&gt;Microsoft’s PowerToys for Windows are essential if you want more customization over how Windows works. There are a variety of tools available, including utilities to keep your PC awake, a system-wide color picking tool, and a FancyZones window manager that lets you quickly position apps into different layouts. One of my favorite PowerToys is Run, which acts as a Mac-like launcher to let you find apps and files or quickly search the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZRd7wc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925447" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="58406Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tq27OF"&gt;OneNote&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OneNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XIO69PsqEkrERgC_dPCw7wyHCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098097/vX7MPdy.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneNote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kWpM4C"&gt;I use OneNote daily to arrange my notes for work and sync them across my PC, laptop, and phone. OneNote is free and fully featured and allows you to divide notes into separate notebooks, sections, and pages. It also fully supports inking, so if you want to take actual notes with a stylus, then it’s ideal. I’d highly recommend this app to students and those who need to take notes regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T5hsiO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925463" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="geAvyW"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Adobe Photoshop Express" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Gg8afDCoo-2vg2Ielhg6HtKP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098107/adobe.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8gEenq"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express is a free photo editing tool that has all the basics you need. While photo editing in the Photos app in Windows 11 has improved, Photoshop Express includes easy-to-use slide bar adjustments and automatic one-touch fixes. There are also a bunch of correction features and even a spot heal feature that lets you remove blemishes or dirt and dust from photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJDHV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925484" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ceA5ys"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qXToMh"&gt;ShareX&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ShareX" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s0V_73g9FIQZZgBTndS-hln4hoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098103/dHKmHfo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‪ShareX Team‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ShareX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFeaR"&gt;ShareX is the best screenshot tool for Windows 11. It’s a great little power-user utility that will let you quickly crop, doodle, and even create GIFs or screen recordings. You can also snap a screenshot and automatically upload it to Imgur or other file hosting websites with one tap of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nXOjZd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925505" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DYpghA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sz4M7t"&gt;QuickLook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="QuickLook" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2LIzTga3KyTkga4aF8llO5nLS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098105/qTwsCEP.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‪Paddy Xu‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QuickLook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qowk4F"&gt;QuickLook is a great app to install if you’re switching from a Mac to a PC, but it’s useful for seasoned PC users, too. It lets you quickly preview files in File Explorer using your spacebar. It works just like the macOS Quick Look feature — you can hit enter to open the file in its default app or choose a different app. It works well for most file types that you’d want to preview, but GIFs might take an extra few seconds to load. QuickLook is far better than constantly opening files to find the one you’re looking for or squinting at thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zh4Ecm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925509" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2NVqBb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qUCwLT"&gt;Start11&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tYkukWgAixA2QfATDpJ9YB9ONE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775843/S11_10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Stardock&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J5m82k"&gt;Stardock’s new Start11 app lets you skin the appearance of the Windows 11 Start menu. You can bring back the classic appearance of the Start menu, change the taskbar size, and position it across multiple monitors. Windows 11 users shouldn’t really need to resort to third-party apps just to bring back basic taskbar functionality that has existed in Windows for decades, but until Microsoft addresses this area, Start11 certainly helps. If you’re missing the time and date on multiple monitors, there’s also &lt;a href="https://github.com/martinet101/ElevenClock"&gt;ElevenClock&lt;/a&gt; that will help until Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812258/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-clock-multiple-monitors-start-menu-updates"&gt;brings back this feature next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cON3zs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925515" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wYp5P3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="po8bFc"&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dolby Access" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8v_kq2G150cFzsddxP_i9LjtlJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098116/Xd9aCzM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dolby&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sTimex"&gt;If you play a lot of PC games, I recommend Dolby Atmos for Headphones. It’s part of the Dolby Access app and will set you back $14.99 for the license, but if you’re a gamer who wants to hear all the footsteps of your enemies, then it’s well worth it. The license also extends to an Xbox, so if you have an Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S, you’ll get full Dolby Atmos support there, too. There’s even a 30-day trial, so you can try Dolby Atmos for Headphones and see if it sounds better than Microsoft’s built-in Windows Sonic spatial sound option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WngGra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925559" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2YU9bT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vp5LWG"&gt;VLC for Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VLC for Windows" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2YE1WDej6bVbNSmG50v30cwhrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098124/50XLeGs.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VLC for Windows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iBqUzz"&gt;Thanks to streaming services, it feels increasingly rare to play local audio or video content on PCs these days, but VLC does it all without any fuss. It’s a free app that supports a variety of codecs, so it should play anything you throw at it. VLC also supports streaming from network locations, so pretty much every video playback scenario is covered with this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IIbACO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925589" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady says the next sideline Surface he yeets will cost him</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="New Orleans Saints v Tampa Bay Buccaneers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zz8oPK-GQmqkYCcZJK0gF1IH-ak=/0x0:8192x5461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328811/1359916928.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8YrAP"&gt;On the Sunday Night Football stage, December 19th, Tom Brady and the Buccaneers were swept for the second consecutive regular season against the Saints — a frustrating shut-out loss that had Brady &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846124/tom-brady-destroy-microsoft-surface-tablet"&gt;spiking a poor Microsoft Surface&lt;/a&gt; tablet on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IhibyQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tom Brady threw the tablet after his INT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFLBrasil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NFLBrasil&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;a href="https://t.co/PyvdFi30NO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyvdFi30NO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1472782726424109061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSgTmN"&gt;Now, per Brady on his Let’s Go podcast &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-division-champs-new-years-resolution"&gt;that aired Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the NFL is not going to let the Surface abuse continue. Should the seven-time Super Bowl champion throw the tablet again, he will be fined. “I did get warned from the NFL about that so... I won’t throw another Surface.” Brady said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LxR3R"&gt;The co-host of the podcast, Jim Gray, joked that the whole incident was just good marketing for Microsoft’s tablet — which has been in use by NFL teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/3/5964307/nfl-replaces-black-and-white-photographs-with-surface-tablets-on-the"&gt;since 2014&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163685/microsoft-nfl-partnership-teams-official-communication-app"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; won a deal to have all 32 NFL teams use them. Gray asked Brady to clarify what exactly the warning from the NFL was; to which Brady responds eloquently: “I can’t throw another Surface, or else I get fined. Imagine that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlswQe"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/recast/524df40b-20f4-5f00-a5e2-e9b1e472e979" height="600" width="600" title="Tom Brady - Division Champs &amp;amp; New Year's Resolution" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQyqZ"&gt;Brady also joked on &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-tough-loss-andrea-bocelli"&gt;last week’s&lt;/a&gt; episode of the Let’s Go podcast: “I didn’t want to throw an interception with that tablet, so I made sure it hit the ground” he said. Brady continued to facetiously chronicle the Surface’s demise: “It was out of use, there was no chance of that one being used after I got a hold of that tablet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDvj0"&gt;“I‘m having a great time playing,” the now 15-time pro bowler said despite the incident “I know it didn’t look like it when I snapped that tablet in half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cN4C6"&gt;It’s not the first time Brady had tossed a Surface in frustration; he threw the tablet last season as well against the Chicago Bears — the game where it looked like he had forgotten what down it was (he later &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-comes-clean-on-fourth-down-gaffe-in-loss-to-bears-in-surprising-tiktok-confession/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; to it on TikTok) and the Bucs ultimately lost by one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJEzjB"&gt;Let’s not totally blame Brady for chucking the tablet though — after all, it was probably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/2/13139174/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface"&gt;nurtured behavior&lt;/a&gt; coming from his legacy in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUICzI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, I spike like 3 tablets a week working on the NYT Mini Crossword. Need to get it under control. “Let’s Go!” is out everywhere now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl"&gt;https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/UKl4P2KPWY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UKl4P2KPWY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Brady (@TomBrady) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1473429623971139590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>A vehicle burned at Canoo’s headquarters after a battery test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPBpwC9YNDV3yoLbUlDD1HtJkL0=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328779/canoo_Design_Exterior_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6U7JXO"&gt;A vehicle at EV startup Canoo burned on August 24th after lithium-ion batteries left inside the car started a fire. The local fire department was able to extinguish the blaze and no one was injured, according to an &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133022/Incident_21_0009517_19951_Mariner_Ave_R.pdf"&gt;incident report&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7J7dx"&gt;The fire happened in the parking lot outside Canoo’s Torrance, California corporate office, which was once the startup’s headquarters — before it started calling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783974/canoo-moves-to-walmart-hometown"&gt;Bentonville, Arkansas home in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4a7Yf"&gt;Canoo’s VP of communications Agnes Gomes-Koizumi confirmed the fire occurred after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; requested comment. “A small fire occurred several hours after the intentionally destructive testing of a battery module,” Gomes said in an e-mailed statement, noting the module passed the test and did not ignite. The fire happened because “someone inappropriately placed the module in a sealed container,” she wrote. “The box the module was placed in became pressurized and resulted in the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUj686"&gt;The car wasn’t one of Canoo’s prototypes, Gomes said, but a third-party cargo vehicle the company had rented or purchased. The incident report lists it as a Ford. Canoo announced a deal to use batteries from Panasonic subsidiary Sanyo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-21-054442/0001213900-21-054442.pdf"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear who made the batteries involved in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q80ekY"&gt;Canoo is working towards a goal of starting production on its electric vans in late 2022, though it has also been turning over executives along the way — including, this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22839732/canoo-cto-cofounders-resign-shakeup-leadership-tony-aquila"&gt;losing its chief technology officer and two of the five remaining co-founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8seUF"&gt;The company joins some other EV startups in dealing with battery fires. One of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17930524/faraday-future-evergrande-investment-jia-yueting-fire"&gt;preproduction vehicles caught fire in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, a prototype of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck &lt;a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire"&gt;caught fire in February 2021&lt;/a&gt; during a road test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUktZ"&gt;Those other fires originated from battery packs that were powering the respective prototype vehicles. Canoo’s fire started in the cabin of the third-party vehicle, according to the report, where lithium-ion batteries were “being transported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytKMMH"&gt;After the fire was extinguished, an officer from Los Angeles County’s Health Hazmat team was called to the scene to help investigate the battery explosion. The remains of the batteries were placed in a “trash can filled with water,” per Health Hazmat’s instructions. The Torrance Fire Department’s report says the fire did an estimated $45,000 worth of damage, including $10,000 in property damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSStnU"&gt;The fire department was on the scene for three and a half hours, though the report doesn’t say how long it took to extinguish the blaze. “The facility was opened the next day and has been functioning normally,” Gomes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Arxv"&gt;The report lists “improper container or storage procedure” and “[u]nattended or unsupervised person” as factors that contributed to the fire. Torrance Fire Department did not respond to multiple emailed requests for comment, and LA County’s Health Hazmat team declined to make someone available for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite servers were down for five hours, but now the game is back online</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lwqJZ8"&gt;There was some bad news if you’re on winter break and hoping to play some &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as Epic Games battle royale shooter went down more than five hours on Wednesday — and this time it wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;to help expand the game’s lore&lt;/a&gt;. According to a tweet from its own &lt;a href="https://status.epicgames.com/incidents/gfv5zzrn0nv4"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue. We’ll provide more info when we have a solution to bring services back online.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="c1ur9f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fortnite game servers are back online and the Winterfest continues! ❄️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We appreciate everyone’s understanding as we worked to resolve these issues and we’ll have more details next week on what we’re doing to help you make up for lost time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ruLmG4xHgk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ruLmG4xHgk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476339842028036099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qm6r8k"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476284634971484163"&gt;follow-up tweet at 3:10PM ET&lt;/a&gt; from the team said they were “continuing to work on a fix that will bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back online and appreciate everyone’s patience.” As of 6PM ET, we hadn’t heard anything since, but at around 6:30PM ET players reported the game was working again, which we have been able to confirm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v91CAN"&gt;The Fortnite Status Twitter eventually &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476339842028036099"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to confirm the game is back up, promising that next week (or, next year) there will be details on “what we’re doing to help you make up for lost time.” It also noted some people might see an extra in-game present to open, but said the team is working on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSQvSH"&gt;Our own senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster reported &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1476220645801447433"&gt;struggling with the platform&lt;/a&gt;, which was telling many players, “You do not have permission to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.” The company started investigating the issue at around 11AM ET, before the servers went offline entirely a couple of hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Vub9FT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fortnite is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll provide more info when we have a solution to bring services back online. &lt;a href="https://t.co/B3wXvu5SL6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3wXvu5SL6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476254959054245898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8PPa0"&gt;When the servers initially went down, the Epic Games launcher wouldn’t even start &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, showing the servers were offline, but later it would try to launch the game. Unfortunately, after launching, as many players have reported and we experienced in a test, it simply placed you in a queue for ten minutes or so and then failed to connect. Now, as of 6:45PM ET, launching the game takes players right in to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxmanM"&gt;Around the same time the issue started, the Epic Games Store was also having problems, where some players said they couldn’t log in or even access their games for offline play. Now at least the Epic Games desktop launcher is working so you can still play other games on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK_0rJq3OvCws9YqPVzhFSZzZQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0006.8.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is one of many e-readers currently available as part of a discounted bundle at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. While newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, keep in mind that the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;The 10th-gen Kindle is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest model features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $89.99, its typical retail price. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. Target and Best Buy, meanwhile, are offering $36 off the price of two if you purchase a pair of the ad-supported models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $119.97 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released the Kindle Kids, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHO6IB"&gt;Right now, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though, we did see it drop to $60 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Best is also taking $44 off the cost of two, if you want to purchase a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0EetaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, the ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjh6fhT1VK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230703/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals122921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fall-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-8gb-tablet-black%2F-%2FA-84609459" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $139.99, its full retail price. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as part of a discounted bundle for $249.97, however, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the $20 discount available on the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Bundle — retailers like Amazon and Best Buy often lower the price of the last-gen model to $89.99 during major shopping holidays and limited-time sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYvMzL"&gt;Although the e-reader is not on sale as a standalone device at the moment, Amazon is currently discounting the Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LN58ZH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMT23Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, along with a leather case and power adapter. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5RQ0ML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10953222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;If you’re looking for a discount, the Essentials bundle is on sale at Amazon for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited. Best also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgji2DnWlVT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers the 8GB model with ads&lt;/a&gt; for $249.99, however, the retailer will knock $100 off the final price if you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
