    <title>Google TV is adding personalized profiles and watchlists soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXDrMPrOQgrXy4cNtJ8qdDfZPWI=/116x0:1907x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979446/1._Profiles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="moDeUO"&gt;Google TV is making finding something to watch in a multiuser household a whole lot less chaotic by adding custom profiles, watchlists, and personalized Google Assistant help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kcT6"&gt;Previously, Google TV supported the ability to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/10050564?hl=en"&gt;sign into multiple Google Accounts&lt;/a&gt; to be able to use services with more than one account. But content suggestions, the watchlist feature, and Google Assistant functionality were all based on the activity of the primary account holder. With personalized profiles, every user’s recommendations, watchlist, and Google Assistant responses will be tailored to their own interests and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N16W7e"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that profiles will start rolling out next month on Chromecast with Google TV as well as Google TVs from TCL and Sony. To streamline the experience, Google said that any downloaded apps and credentials can be used across different profiles. The company previously introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318824/google-tv-kid-profiles-announced-features-parental-controls"&gt;kids' profiles&lt;/a&gt; on Google TV earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c75f0EHz6vTwVKYk4qoYppbubOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911182/2._Glanceable_cards_in_Ambient_mode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4IedT"&gt;After profiles arrive next month, Google will separately introduce “glanceable cards” on ambient mode. When that support arrives, an idle TV can display personalized information like weather, news, and sports stats, among other tailored-to-you information. This screen will also display shortcuts for things like podcasts, music, and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3grgEw"&gt;Separately, the mobile remote app for Google TV that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;launched on Android&lt;/a&gt; last month will soon be available in the Google Home app on Android and iOS, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HMDdI"&gt;Profiles, an updated ambient mode, and expanded support for the virtual Google TV remote — for those times when the couch eats your streaming wand — follows news this week that Google TV added support for Philo in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524794/google-tv-sling-tv-live-integration"&gt;live TV tab&lt;/a&gt;. Previously limited to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675068/youtube-tv-spanish-language-content-expansion"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; ($65 per month) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252810/sling-tv-price-increase-free-dvr-youtube-hulu"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt; ($35 per month), Philo is now Google TV’s most affordable live TV option and starts at $25 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Burn-in isn’t a huge risk for Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but you can still take precautions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzo1L33x9766grmZuJxGPC7LEfY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979996/DSCF5796.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gKkOC3"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch OLED Model is now available, and even if it’s no Switch Pro, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;a lot to like about it&lt;/a&gt;. But as new owners of the console start enjoying its larger, more vibrant screen, some might also wonder whether they should pay any mind to the classic “risk” of OLED technology: burn-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGgn1t"&gt;In the early days of OLED smartphones, it wasn’t uncommon to find a mistreated demo phone at a carrier or Best Buy that had a ghastly display with home screen icons or a status bar left permanently visible whenever the screen was on. Burn-in could also befall OLED TVs if they were carelessly left on a news channel (with a ticker at the bottom) for many hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIPUn1"&gt;But we’ve come a long way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cz22A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/nintendo-plans-switch-model-with-bigger-samsung-oled-display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung Display is supplying the Switch OLED Model’s 7-inch panel, and that’s about the best news you could ask for when it comes to the longevity and reliability of your $350 console’s screen. Samsung has led the evolution of OLED on mobile devices, and while burn-in is still technically &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; on its modern panels, they’re more resistant to it, and software-based mitigations from Samsung, LG, and others have made it less of an issue than ever before. I’ve got an LG CX OLED that shows zero signs of burn-in after a year of pretty extensive playtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSStQH"&gt;But on a video game console with plenty of persistent HUDs and other fixed onscreen icons, it’s worth taking &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; care when playing the Switch OLED Model. Gaming has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/tv-audio-video/what-is-burn-in/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;always been a potential hazard for OLED&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, as long as you use the device in conventional ways and don’t intentionally try to do lasting damage to its display, you should be totally fine — but there are still things to look out for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqoSkV"&gt;Nintendo itself offers some pointers for keeping the Switch’s display looking its best over the long term. In the console’s documentation, the company says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="R8OlMN"&gt;“To minimize the risk of image retention or screen burn-in occurring on the OLED screen, do not turn off the system’s default sleep mode settings and take care to not display the same image on the OLED screen for extended periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtvf2"&gt;Image retention can look similar to burn-in — something “sticks” on the screen after it’s supposed to be gone — but isn’t permanent and goes away on its own as you do other things on the console’s display. If you notice it, it’s a good warning sign to jump over to another game for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4Tszx"&gt;Advising customers not to mess with the &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22353/~/how-to-change-the-sleep-mode-settings#DT:t1-q1a3EP:t1-q1a3-c"&gt;sleep mode&lt;/a&gt; defaults is Nintendo’s attempt to ensure the Switch OLED Model won’t be left sitting somewhere on a static screen for hours. Game HUDs are one thing, but even the Switch’s homescreen has a lot of fixed elements. I’d try to avoid letting the console just sit on that screen for lengthy periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DNikv8"&gt;Does the Switch OLED Model have any specific software features to avoid burn-in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d5YxoM"&gt;As far as what we can tell from what Nintendo has told us so far, the answer is no. In settings, there’s no sign of any screen refresher, which is an animation to help eliminate any image retention. Nintendo also didn’t say whether it subtly shifts pixels in the Switch’s UX to avoid potential issues. The only &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22390/~/how-to-activate-screen-burn-in-reduction"&gt;“burn-in protection” item in settings&lt;/a&gt; still applies just to connected TVs; the Switch will dim a TV’s screen after a few minutes of inactivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAi53c"&gt;Nintendo is mostly just encouraging owners of the Switch OLED Model to use the existing auto-brightness and sleep features to prolong the panel’s lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sq45KW"&gt;Enjoy your Switch OLED Model and don’t sweat burn-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6nxs"&gt;If you’re using the console in normal ways and switching up the games you play, you’ll likely avoid any burn-in problems for a long, long time. You’ll probably face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715467/nintendo-joy-con-drift-never-fixed-switch-oled"&gt;other issues like Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt; long before experiencing any burn-in. The proper Switch Pro might even arrive before you see any screen aberrations. Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;maybe not&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that, barring any unforeseen quality defects with the screen (which is unlikely for a Samsung panel), it would take extreme circumstances for burn-in to ruin your console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTuyGI"&gt;But if you’ve got the brightness cranked all the way up, turn off sleep mode, and leave it sitting on a still screen for an entire week, yeah… bad things will probably happen. Use common sense, vary it up, and don’t stress; enjoy the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P7jn1s"&gt;How to avoid burn-in on the Nintendo Switch OLED Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HQ8Uuo"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Watch your brightness.&lt;/strong&gt; Image retention and burn-in could be more likely if you’re always playing at max brightness. You don’t have to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; careful here; I immediately disabled auto brightness on my unit and typically have it in the 75 to 80 percent range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lznOQE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vary your games. &lt;/strong&gt;No one’s telling you not to sink hours upon hours into your favorite title. Go for it! But if you want to preserve the OLED Model’s screen for the long haul, try to mix it up with other games in between those marathon sessions so that the Switch’s pixels see some variety. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kCjD4j"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don’t turn off the sleep timer.&lt;/strong&gt; By default, the Nintendo Switch is set to go to sleep after five minutes of inactivity. You can also pick options between 60 seconds and 30 minutes. I think 10 minutes is as far as I’d leave it, personally, but definitely don’t pick “never” if you want to protect the display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Nintendo won’t make Europeans play worse versions of N64 games on Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfQ838-YOAFudQ6gL5ipxTRIjh0=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979985/image.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The release also includes Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82bUHf"&gt;The Nintendo 64 games being re-released as part of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription&lt;/a&gt; will run at 60Hz, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1447552226830991361"&gt;Nintendo of Europe&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed. The news follows concerns &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-24-nintendo-fans-fear-european-switch-online-n64-games-will-be-50hz"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the re-released games, which include classic titles like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, would run at a reduced 50Hz in European PAL regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da8NEK"&gt;The disparity is a holdover from the days of standard definition TVs which typically used the 50Hz PAL standard in Europe, but the 60Hz NTSC standard in the US. It meant that footage shown on European TVs would refresh 50 times per second, rather than 60 as in the US. This wasn’t a major issue for regular TV content (which typically ran at 30fps in the US and 25fps in PAL regions), but it had a big impact on games where it could reduce the smoothness and responsiveness of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3GqFGB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All Nintendo 64 games included with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitchOnline&lt;/a&gt; + Expansion Pack can be played in 60Hz English language versions. Select games will also have the option to play the original European PAL version with language options. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nZeO4WQaPN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nZeO4WQaPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of Europe (@NintendoEurope) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1447552226830991361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T80ZWZ"&gt;Concerns that the re-releases would run at 50Hz in PAL regions arose pretty quickly after their Nintendo Direct announcement. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-24-nintendo-fans-fear-european-switch-online-n64-games-will-be-50hz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the broadcast showed the games running noticeably slower in the Nintendo UK version, and Nintendo declined to comment when asked about the disparity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9snHBa"&gt;The problem has cropped up with previous re-releases. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/uh-oh_nintendo_switch_onlines_n64_games_might_be_50hz_in_europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the Wii’s Virtual Console included some 50Hz PAL games, although the company would rectify this with the Virtual Console service on the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7WXMW"&gt;As well as offering a 60Hz option, Nintendo says select games will also include the option of playing in their original PAL versions “with language options.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hHTLe"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is set to include nine Nintendo 64 titles when it launches in late October, as well as a selection of Sega Genesis games. More N64 games, including &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;F-Zero X&lt;/em&gt; are due to arrive at a later date. The price of the subscription service is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astronaut Sally Ride will be one of the women featured on a 2022 US quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyA9S8Wj3FMNI4VxTvmSCgdUKUk=/0x231:2000x1564/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979601/2022_american_women_quarters_coin_sally_ride_line_art_reverse.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sally Ride, the first American woman to go to space, will be memorialized on a 2022 quarter.  | US Mint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G0hrfG"&gt;Sally Ride, the first American woman to travel to space, will be featured on one of the first five coins in the US Mint’s &lt;a href="https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-announces-designs-for-2022-american-women-quarters-program-coins"&gt;American Women Quarters Program&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning next year and continuing through 2025, the Mint will issue five quarters each year with tails-side designs featuring trailblazing American women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snkcKf"&gt;Ride, who died in 2012 at age 61, flew aboard the space shuttle Challenger in 1983, and again in 1984. She was slated to go on a third shuttle mission, but after the Challenger blew up in 1986, NASA suspended the shuttle program, and Ride retired a year later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM4C9N"&gt;She continued to advise NASA, as part of the panel that investigated the Challenger accident and a study team that wrote a report recommending the agency work on an outpost on the Moon. Ride later became director of the California Space Institute at UC San Diego. She also wrote six children’s books about science, and started a company called &lt;a href="https://sallyridescience.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Sally Ride Science&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, with a focus on reducing the gender gap in STEM programs and careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0Oc3q"&gt;The design of the quarter depicts Ride next to a window on the space shuttle, which the Mint says was inspired by her comment “When I wasn’t working, I was usually at a window looking down at Earth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNQnCC"&gt;Also on the &lt;a href="https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs/american-women-quarters"&gt;list of women&lt;/a&gt; to be featured on 2022 quarters are the late poet and author Maya Angelou, Native American activist Wilma Mankiller, educator and suffragist Nina Otero-Warren, and Chinese-American movie star Anna May Wong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laIvdh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s plans for Fuchsia OS teased in job listings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vzC8mDnkoD2XRVgqaHjY0bWBrU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979047/dseifert_181018_3039_1192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first generation Nest Hub, which was updated to run Fuchsia earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fg2p03"&gt;Google says “it’s time” to now bring its mysterious Fuchsia operating system to “additional smart devices and other form factors” beyond smart displays, according to a number of job listings first &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/08/google-fuchsia-expanding-additional-smart-devices/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fuchsia is Google’s newest operating system which was released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630245/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-rollout-release-date"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for the company’s first-generation Nest Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytSHOJ"&gt;There’s been a lot of speculation about Google’s plans for Fuchsia, which unlike Android and Chrome OS doesn’t use a Linux kernel (it uses a microkernel called Zircon instead), and whose purpose is still fairly vague despite having been public for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;over five years&lt;/a&gt;. When it arrived on the Nest Hub it was more or less functionally identical to the software that preceded it. The new job listings offer some clues about what’s next for Fuchsia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qCkFag"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s coming to “additional form factors and use cases”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5V7ozf"&gt;For starters, it seems like Google now has a named “Fuchsia Devices team” working on the operating system, which gives some indication of the importance of the software internally. A &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/100916923237049030-staff-software-engineer-fuchsia-devices/"&gt;job listing&lt;/a&gt; notes that this team “is responsible for making sure we can successfully apply the Fuchsia platform to real world products that make a difference to Google and our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJFlwZ"&gt;Meanwhile, this same listing notes that Google is working to bring Fuchsia to “additional smart devices and other form factors,” which confirms it’s under development for devices beyond smart displays. This isn’t entirely surprising given &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/03/06/fuchsia-friday-nelson-luis-hint-made-by-google/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on the OS running on smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5hRFg"&gt;There’s no mention of what exactly these new form factors are, but another of the job listings (which has since been removed) spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;mentions the devices will feature “Chromecast, Video Conferencing and Machine Learning” capabilities. In this context, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that “Chromecast” is likely to refer to the devices letting you “cast” a video from another device for playback, rather than the dedicated Chromecast dongles that plug into the back of a TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yl35XC"&gt;Finally, there’s a tantalizing hint that Fuchsia could either run or interact with non-Google partner hardware in &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/124160473638544070-staff-software-engineer-fuchsia-platform-graphics-and-media/"&gt;a third job listing&lt;/a&gt; for someone who’ll “ensure that Fuchsia is bringing maximum value to partners&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and Fuchsia-based products.” Google has a long history of working with partners to bring Google software to non-Google hardware, and has previously partnered with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2018/8/1/17640698/jbl-link-view-google-smart-display-speaker-release-date"&gt;JBL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616560/lenovo-smart-display-review-google-assistant-smart-speaker-screen"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; on their smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbBxXE"&gt;None of these hints offer concrete information about what’s next for Fuchsia. But given how low-key the operating system continues to be five years after its announcement, we’ll take what we can get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Pixel Pass’ is Google’s rumored response to Apple One</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBXqdiCLLPocryObgqyRZkBLflo=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69978928/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzuRZB"&gt;Google seems poised to announce a new subscription bundle called “Pixel Pass,” which would combine a new Pixel device with an extended warranty and premium subscriptions for several Google services. The unconfirmed bundle has been detailed in a leaked image &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500/photo/1"&gt;published by Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear how much Pixel Pass would cost, but the documents suggest it will be sold via Google Fi and the Google Store alongside the purchase of a Pixel device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbOwjS"&gt;As Lee notes, Pixel Pass appears to combine elements of Apple’s iPhone Upgrade program (which offers an iPhone via monthly subscription payments alongside an extended warranty) and its Apple One subscription services bundle. Pixel Pass could be pitched as a way to simplify access to all these services as well as offering the peace of mind of an extended warranty. Pixel Pass might also offer a discount compared to paying for the services individually, though there’s currently no indication of how much Pixel Pass might cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="As2uQz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pixel Pass: This appears to be a blend of the iPhone upgrade plan where you can get a new phone every year and the Apple One Subscription.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains YouTube Premium, Google One, Play Pass, extended warranty, and is associated with Google Fi.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iU7VTc16vS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iU7VTc16vS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rwXHnh"&gt;From the documents, it seems Pixel Pass will combine up to four subscriptions: YouTube Premium or YouTube Music, Google One, Play Pass, and Google Fi. These services cover video and music streaming, cloud storage, an app subscription bundle, and mobile network coverage. There’s no mention of Google Stadia, the search giant’s cloud game streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPBlWN"&gt;The leak suggests that the extended device warranty will function similarly to Google’s existing &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en-GB"&gt;Preferred Care&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6309809?hl=en#zippy=%2Caccidental-damage%2Cmechanical-breakdown%2Closs-or-theft"&gt;Device Protection&lt;/a&gt; services, which offer protection against accidental and mechanical breakdown damage. Currently, Preferred Care is only available in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico, while Device Protection is only offered with the US-only Google Fi service. This suggests Pixel Pass might be a North America-only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBHhgE"&gt;There’s no mention of which Pixel phones the Pixel Pass will be offered with. But given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Pixel 6 event is coming on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;, it seems likely that Pixel Pass will be introduced as an accompaniment for the new flagship smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bVXRU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ7xX3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fairphone 4 review: the price of sustainability </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A modular smartphone that (mostly) feels like a modern device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7LpNJK"&gt;It’s been hard to fault Fairphone’s sustainable credentials over the years, whether it’s the company’s lengthy support periods, easy repairability, or ethically sourced materials. But when it comes to the devices themselves, previous Fairphones have struggled to be competitive with similarly priced smartphones. They lacked modern features, used outdated designs, and generally had more quirks than you’d expect to get from a modern phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW4E1n"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is a big step forward. It’s every bit as sustainable, with a modular repairable design that Fairphone now offers a five-year warranty for. But more important is that it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; much more like a modern smartphone. The huge top and bottom bezels of the Fairphone 3 have been stripped away, and there are also modern conveniences like an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAHhFB"&gt;With a starting price of €579 / £499 (around $669, though Fairphone has no plans to sell the Fairphone 4 in the states) for the 6GB RAM / 128GB storage model, the Fairphone 4 costs a premium compared to its competitors. It’s also getting a much more limited Europe-only release, with no plans for a US launch. But if you only need a smartphone to do basic smartphone stuff, and you’re prepared to pay a premium over other similarly capable competitors, I think the Fairphone 4 is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxhIV"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is available to pre-order now, and devices will start shipping on October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="232Djm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10796788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iX5Fu"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20834741/fairphone-3-release-date-news-specs-features"&gt;Fairphone 3&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it, it’s hard to believe the Fairphone 4 has been produced by the same manufacturer. The chunky and dated top and bottom bezels from the previous phone are gone, replaced with a sheet of Gorilla Glass 5 that stretches right from the top of the Fairphone 4 to the bottom. It feels like Fairphone has caught up with the rest of the smartphone industry, even if that’s because the rate of smartphone evolution has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Uo8jf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsbqHK"&gt;Yes, the bezels are still sizable by modern standards, but they’re small enough that the phone is able to have a large 6.3-inch display without feeling too ungainly. It’s LCD rather than OLED, and viewing angles aren’t amazing, but I was happy with how it looked after I turned off its overkill image enhancement options in its Settings app and tweaked the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78jwf6"&gt;There are two versions of the Fairphone 4 available: one with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (the model I’ve been using for this review) and a step-up version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which retails for €649 / £569. Both are otherwise identical and feature the same cameras, 3,905 mAh battery, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9r_np83cVAcREEdcoDAHzcrKGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908020/jporter_071021__4794_0254.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back is easily removable to access the phone’s internals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GkClOpsb8buLEeQecJ_pB3cufI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908019/jporter_071021__4794_0257.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small philips head screws keep the phone’s components in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDWKt"&gt;More important than the specs are what the internals of the Fairphone 4 are actually made of. In here, there’s Fairtrade-certified gold, ethically sourced aluminum and tungsten, and recycled tin, rare earth minerals and plastics. Fairphone also aims to turn these materials into a phone as ethically as possible, thanks to initiatives that aim to improve working conditions for the miners and factory workers involved in the phone’s supply chain. Each phone is also “e-waste neutral,” Fairphone claims, since the company will recycle either a phone or an equivalent amount of e-waste with each sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRJxMJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The phone’s SIM card is inserted under its removable battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QCyXk"&gt;Flip over the Fairphone 4, and you’ll see its back (made out of 100 percent recycled plastic), which can be easily removed without any tools to reveal the phone’s removable battery and the Phillips head screws that can be used to easily remove everything from its rear cameras to its USB-C port and loudspeaker. You’ll need to take this rear panel off to insert a SIM card underneath the battery during setup, a process which handily doesn’t require the use of a SIM tool — convenient given there isn’t one included in the box (though Fairphone tells me this may differ between release markets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0B1mm"&gt;iFixit is yet to pass its official judgment on the repairability of the Fairphone 4, but the company’s previous phones are the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B3%2BTeardown%2F125573&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B2%2BTeardown%2F52523&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; devices to have gotten perfect 10s from the repair specialists. As well as being easy to remove, the parts should also be easy to replace since Fairphone plans to have replacements available until at least 2027 (as a benchmark, the company still has some spare parts left for the almost six-year-old Fairphone 2). A five-year warranty should also keep the repair costs down over the life of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pOcEpqMpHU_kovXO_HlG3lv5e4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908018/jporter_071021__4794_0235.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fair enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qbyeuzjHv9vjpwKGVEm972FVp_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908022/jporter_071021__4794_0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone, with its triangular camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4LNK8p"&gt;On the software side, the Fairphone 4 ships with Android 11, but the company hopes to provide at least two major Android updates, or four if it can manage it. It’s done a good job at delivering on these promises with previous phones… eventually. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349953/fairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support"&gt;finally released Android 9 for the Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Impressive given the Fairphone 2 was five years old at the time, less impressive given it came almost three years after Android 9’s original release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_Vg3R8uiFKzdQE2YS5JZCjAj50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908021/jporter_071021__4794_0224.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s side-mounted fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHDj42"&gt;As you might expect from a phone that can ship without a SIM tool, the Fairphone 4 doesn’t come with anything in the way of accessories in the box as standard. There’s no charging brick, no included headphones, and no USB-C charging cable in the box. There’s also no miniature included screwdriver like we saw with the Fairphone 3. It may have been a cute indicator of its repairability credentials, but including it didn’t make much sense if you’re trying to minimize unnecessary accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugpMFN"&gt;On the right of the phone, there’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that doubles as a power button, which I prefer to rear-mounted sensors even if they’re not as convenient as under-display models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WdRgb"&gt;There’s no headphone jack next to the Fairphone 4’s USB-C port, which isn’t exactly surprising given it’s a smartphone released in 2021, but is a little more disappointing given Fairphone’s focus on being as consumer-friendly as possible. The team tells me the tradeoff was made to allow for the phone to have an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. That means the phone should survive being used in the rain, but not full submersion, and it’s not an insubstantial achievement given the back of this modular phone can literally be unclipped without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPt_lSvFDXxAg75ux_n1KXIq-DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910248/IMG_20211002_125707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, this phone can survive a bit of rain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w7Cvv"&gt;As it turns out, I ended up using the Fairphone 4 to take photos during an exceptionally rainy walk while vacationing in the Welsh countryside, so I feel pretty confident saying that the company’s claims about the phone being rainproof are accurate. Here’s a selfie of me on the walk if you want to get an idea of just how rainy I’m talking about (it should also give you an indicator of how the phone’s 25-megapixel selfie camera performs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYVSZG"&gt;It’s great to see Fairphone using a more capable 7-series Snapdragon processor compared to the 6-series one used in the Fairphone 3. For the most part, the Snapdragon 750G keeps up with the demands I placed on the phone in everyday usage, but it wasn’t perfect. Waking up Google Assistant with a swipe up from the corner of the screen to ask a query took a beat longer than I’m normally used to, and there were sometimes hitches in the YouTube app when switching videos between normal and full-screen viewing. It’s capable rather than slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybh4yM"&gt;But while overall performance is OK, the phone isn’t without its quirks. The most frustrating issue I found is that the Fairphone 4 isn’t great at palm rejection, so when you’re holding it one-handed and reach your thumb across, it’ll confuse your palm for an intentional tap. The Fairphone 4 also seemed to spend more time connected to 3G networks than other smartphones I’ve used, even in areas where I normally get a 4G signal. Other times, however, it happily connected to 5G networks. A strange quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2LBahIIZUVpap1RqKYBPHzQbY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908014/jporter_071021__4794_0229.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That camera bump again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0svpruwvdaJqFZTRZsrPIPU0_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908012/jporter_071021__4794_0226.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gGDD3W"&gt;I had no problems with battery life during my time with the Fairphone 4 and generally averaged around four and five hours of screen on time per charge. For me, this typically translated to putting the phone on to charge with between 10 and 50 percent of charge left in the tank at the end of the day. On one day of traveling, I used the Fairphone 4 for several hours of podcast and music listening via wireless headphones, a few hours of social media scrolling, and then for two hours of navigation while wirelessly connected via Android Auto, and I still had 10 percent of battery left when I put it on charge at 11PM that night. The phone supports 20W fast charging, which Fairphone says should refill half its battery in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YUzqsf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xo0YDR"&gt;Performance is acceptable, battery life is good, and the phone’s screen is perfectly fine. But the only area of the Fairphone 4 that I think could be a real dealbreaker for some people is its camera, which, despite being based around a pair of 48-megapixel sensors (one for the main camera and one for the ultrawide), produces mediocre shots, even in broad daylight. It’s nice to have the versatility of dual cameras, which are a first for a Fairphone, but it’s a shame that the images they capture are disappointing in anything other than broad daylight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvmljv"&gt;I think the images in the gallery below speak for themselves. They often look uncomfortably grainy, and there’s a smudginess to most shots that had me searching through the camera app’s settings to make sure I didn’t have a weird setting turned on. But perhaps worse than the quality of the photos themselves is just how slow and laggy the camera app is. Even in daylight, tapping the shutter can cause a painstaking couple of moments before the camera is able to focus and take a photo, and it’s even worse at night. The Fairphone 4 is the only time I’ve regretted using a review phone for vacation snaps because I regret not coming home with nicer photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTsaEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10796861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NlmfCY"&gt;If you’re spending money on a Fairphone 4, your money isn’t being spent on performance. It’s being spent on that five-year warranty, the promise of years of software support, and the security of knowing that, when 2026 rolls around, you’ll still be able to buy a new battery and pop it into the back of the phone without having to learn what a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2BSE%2B2020%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F133814&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pentalobe screw&lt;/a&gt; is. And, of course, you’re paying to ensure that all these parts have been made from as responsibly sourced materials as possible in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TLVrB"&gt;Whether it’s Fairtrade or organic food or sustainably produced clothing, there’s the expectation that you’ll have to pay a price premium for ethically-produced goods, and that’s exactly the case with the Fairphone 4. Although it starts at €579, its performance, especially when it comes to its cameras, is arguably closer to phones that cost less than half as much, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; (which retails for the equivalent of roughly €170) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; (around €140). And it’s not at all competitive with smartphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for 128GB) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€399), which are closer in price but still cheaper than the Fairphone 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Uw1WgG"&gt;But if you’re the kind of person that can live with the budget phones listed above, if you just need a smartphone for daily use and aren’t concerned about having the best camera or most premium-feeling device, then I think you’re the kind of person who can live with the Fairphone 4. It’s a decent €200 phone that happens to be priced at €579. That’s the price of sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram to introduce “take a break” feature and “nudge” teens away from harmful content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9zamHgA9yifo6KNVEpzgV6eW6A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977627/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qiXWV4"&gt;Instagram will introduce new measures to nudge teenagers away from harmful content and encourage them to “take a break,” from the platform, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said on Sunday. Clegg made the remarks on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"&gt;CNN’s State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; show less than a week after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50IxCc"&gt;“We’re going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that a teenagers is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other content,” Clegg said. He added that in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;pausing plans for an Instagram Kids&lt;/a&gt; platform and giving parents optional controls to supervise teens, the company planned to introduce a feature “called ‘take a break,’ where we will be prompting teens to just simply take a break from using Instagram.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmTmf0"&gt;Clegg didn’t provide a timeline for either feature. In response to an email from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;seeking further details, a Facebook spokesperson said the features are “not testing yet but will soon.” The spokesperson pointed to a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;September 27th blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Instagram head Adam Mosseri which mentioned the company was “exploring” the features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="se8uqp"&gt;We announced &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that we’re exploring two new ideas: encouraging people to look at other topics if they’re dwelling on content that might contribute to negative social comparison, and a feature tentatively called “Take a Break,” where people could put their account on pause and take a moment to consider whether the time they’re spending is meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OUBM15"&gt;CNN host Dana Bash asked Clegg whether Facebook’s algorithm amplified or spread pro-insurrection voices ahead of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;riot at the US Capitol building on January 6th&lt;/a&gt;. Clegg said he couldn’t give a yes or no answer to the question. Haugen is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/tech/facebook-whistleblower-january-6-select-committee/index.html"&gt;reportedly going meet with the committee&lt;/a&gt; investigating the January 6th attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV1SLW"&gt;Clegg did say that Facebook’s algorithms “should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation so that people can match what our systems say they’re supposed to do from what actually happens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvEts1"&gt;Facebook has been under intense criticism for the past several weeks, following reporting from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;based on internal documents that Haugen provided. A former product manager at Facebook, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at a hearing focused on the company’s internal research that showed &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;Instagram can be toxic, particularly for teen girls&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;Zuckerberg disputed&lt;/a&gt; Haugen’s account, saying it was illogical for a company that relies on advertisers to push content that makes people angry to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin postpones William Shatner’s space flight by a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 Creative Arts Emmy Awards - Day 1 - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZBM1JKdnNPxRlLXrBDM7ZGOZgQ=/4x0:4197x2795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977202/1029659286.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Shatner is heading to space on October 13th | Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEIWgA"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin said Sunday it will postpone the flight that is slated to fly William Shatner to space due to forecasted high winds at its launch site. The flight of the company’s New Shepard spacecraft is now scheduled for 9:30AM ET on October 13th, a day later than originally planned. It’s targeted to lift off from Blue Origin’s Launch Site One in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRwFsp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-18-mission-updates"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s website said New Shepard NS-18 has met all mission requirements, and the astronauts have started their training. “Weather is the only gating factor for the launch window,” according to the statement, which is signed with the company motto “Gradatim Ferociter” (Latin for “step by step, ferociously”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teKdip"&gt;The company officially announced last week that Shatner, best known as Captain James T. Kirk from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek, &lt;/em&gt;will join the crew of New Shepard for its second crewed flight. Shatner, 90, will be the oldest person to fly to space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;New Shepard’s first crewed flight&lt;/a&gt; in July brought Bezos, his brother Mark, aviator Wally Funk, and teenager Oliver Daeman to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMs9L8"&gt;Shatner will be joined by Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer and co-founder of satellite company Planet Labs, Glen de Vries, the co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at a French software company, and Audrey Powers, Blue Origin’s vice president of mission and flight operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Star Trek: Discovery, Doctor Who: Flux, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FxRR1uvAuJLwxtMqUF5xdc-AQwI=/103x0:1149x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977124/star_trek_discovery.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Captain Michael Burnham in Star Trek: Discovery | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIPT9WC6Vsk" target="_blank"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6WMUo"&gt;Before it premiered, Jason Sudeikis &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/07/22/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-2-star-wars-fans/7979429002/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; season two of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; as the show’s &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; season, and sure enough, the entire season focused on fathers and sons, and after the season finale we have a pretty clear “enemy” all set up for season three. I know season two was not as universally liked as its freshman season, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; dug into some thorny issues about men and sports and mental health that few other shows attempt, and still managed to make me smile pretty much every week. I’ll miss this show until its return next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyMPUM"&gt;I’ve also managed to binge-watch &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix— an interesting if not quite fully-baked examination of organized religion— and am still hanging in there with &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; which has gotten quite spicy thanks mainly to Julianna Margulies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttURCn"&gt;The theme of this week’s trailers: titles with colons in them. A couple of these dropped Saturday during New York Comic Con; look for a recap of this year’s event Monday on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyMB2p"&gt;Here’s this week’s roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iGOGHq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIPT9WC6Vsk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ct93N6"&gt;Star Trek: Discovery &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DJBho9"&gt;The fourth season of&lt;em&gt; Discovery&lt;/em&gt; finds Michael Burnham in the captain’s chair of the ship (yesss), and she and the crew are facing “a threat unlike any they’ve ever encountered,” according to the promo copy. This time it’s a massive anomaly threatening the entire galaxy, Federation planet or not. Sonequa Martin-Green, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Wilson Cruz, David Ajala, and Doug Jones return in season four, and the trailer gives us a few glimpses of guest stars David Cronenberg, Oded Fehr, and Tig Notaro. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; boldly goes (sorry) to Paramount Plus on November 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvjFeH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MOcaQC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrGBqKqb3gg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="r2tt9R"&gt;Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4ytUuh"&gt;Just getting it out of the way early: No, we don’t get a hint of who the next Doctor will be. This is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; even a teaser at 19 seconds long, but we do get a fair bit of information about season 13. Doctor Who (Jodie Whittaker) tells us “we don’t have much time” and cautions that “the flux is coming” and bringing with it various enemies from across the universe, for “the fight of our lives.” This is Whittaker’s final season as the titular Doctor and we don’t have to wait too long for new episodes;&lt;em&gt; Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/em&gt; comes to BBC America on October 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arbmRQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUu3lK_Z8VM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KvOtoX"&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8UbCr"&gt;The new anime series based in the Blade Runner universe is set in Los Angeles in 2032, so about halfway between &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em&gt;(set in 2019) and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. We got a teaser a few months ago, but in the full trailer we get a look at Elle, a replicant wondering why her dreams are getting worse (“what did you do to us?” she asks), and by the end she’s decided “I’m going to kill them all,” but we don’t know who the “them” are. The animation in the trailer is really stunning, particularly the scenes of seedy future LA. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Crunchyroll and Adult Swim on November 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJxkoR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBYsSos0xhY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHCKvr"&gt;Dune&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUHMy0"&gt;After multiple pandemic-related &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a few teasers and trailers, we get one last &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;trailer before its debut. In addition to a reminder that “fear is the mind-killer,” we get a look at some of the movie’s massive battle sequences (look, ornithopters!) We’re all ready. Let’s go. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters and HBO Max on October 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xh96lM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJomaOzgKpc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6zdiMi"&gt;Hanna&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KJy7bA"&gt;An action series about a woman turned into a super soldier by a shady government program is so relevant to my interests it’s almost comical and yet I haven’t watched &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;. Its third season comes to Amazon Prime Video on November 24th, so I’ve got time to watch seasons one and two before then. Esme Creed-Miles stars along with Dermot Mulroney, Mireille Enos, and Aine Rose Daly.&lt;/p&gt;
