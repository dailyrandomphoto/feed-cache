    <title>Trello is redesigning its project management platform for a remote work future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gw5Mz49Hjgl0SEHiMdhOCueNpWM=/300x0:2100x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825315/trello_redesign.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Trello&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0qkpK"&gt;Productivity app Trello, a virtual whiteboard-style platform for organizing and managing projects, is announcing a major redesign today in addition to new features for helping businesses manage third-party integrations. The platform is getting a visual overhaul, both to its logo and the illustrations it deploys across its website and apps. It’s also getting multiple new ways to both customize cards and view your workload beyond the core whiteboard column view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Hcou"&gt;“During the pandemic, Trello became many people’s new offices in a remote-first world. The overnight shift to distributed work coupled with the frantic adoption of digital tools led to an exponential increase in digital work artifacts scattered across apps, some of which now resemble a graveyard of ‘tried-and-tossed’ tools,” explains Trello co-founder Michael Pryor, who leads up the platform at enterprise software giant Atlassian following its acquisition in 2017, in a blog post published on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i64RdS"&gt;Pryor says Trello has accumulated well over 50 million users, and the company wants to expand the way Trello works with third-party services like Google Drive, ticketing platform Jira, and Slack. “Today, we are unveiling the beginning of a whole new Trello, built specifically to support teams as they usher in a new era of work. These features, along with our plans for the future, will give users a central vantage point from which to view, plan and tackle their work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZ3S5X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trello is treating third-party services as key to its platform going forward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aGRU7n"&gt;The new cards include both mirror cards and link cards, which the company hopes will make it easier to manage other apps and services from within Trello. Link cards, for instance, can now display previews if they contain a link to a third-party service like Dropbox, Google Docs, and YouTube. Another new card type, mirror cards, will let you pair together cards across multiple boards, so changes to one are reflected on all the others. Trello says this should help cut down on confusion and unnecessary interoffice updates, because more basic information about the status of a project will be automatically available instead of having to be manually communicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1dCB"&gt;Trello is also introducing five new board views that deviate from the standard column layout the platform helped popularize. These include team table view for turning multiple Trello boards into something more akin to a spreadsheet for easy viewing; timeline view for organizing a complex project by upcoming deadlines; calendar view for tracking projects and even simply individual to-do list items on a monthly basis; map view for organizing projects that incorporate information (like real estate); and dashboard view for visualizations of data and other project information into bar, line, and pie charts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oquj0N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10345238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVTnag"&gt;These changes may help Trello, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, stay competitive against alternatives like Asana, as well as the scores of smaller project management apps all vying for a coveted spot among the ever-growing list of software tools used by small startups and large corporations alike. Key to that, Pryor says, is acknowledging that Trello can’t be the one app that does everything you want it to do, but rather that it needs to be flexible enough to let companies and small teams connect to the tools they do need and have it all be accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiREO6"&gt;“‘Hey, we’re just going to get everyone to use our tool, we will be the project management tool to rule them all.’ When you look at how people work, that strategy is a little myopic,” Pryror told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview last week. “There’s a lot of different tools people use to get their job done and they’re not all the same thing to different people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jfwdo"&gt;The goal for Trello going forward, he added, is figuring out “how can we expand the card metaphor to different tools and to give you a perspective on all the work that’s happening.” New types of cards, and new ways of visualizing Trello’s signature whiteboard, could help expand those metaphors and, Pryor hopes, make people more productive in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator’s new UK update brings famous castles and football stadiums to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbEDZkvDBZCQCx5Yt_YaBTUddUs=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825255/flightsim.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator UK update.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBVSy4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big update today focused on the UK and Ireland. The World Update III, as Microsoft puts it, includes high-resolution 3G imagery for cities like London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, and Oxford. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/microsoft-flight-simulator-world-update-iii-uk-ireland-now-available-for-free/"&gt;More than 70 custom landmarks&lt;/a&gt; and points of interest have been improved, including famous bridges, palaces, cathedrals, and famous Premier League football (soccer!) stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzMaK1"&gt;If you’ve tried to visit some Premier League clubs in &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; already, you’ve probably noticed they’re usually just a giant generic-looking apartment block. This update aims to improve that experience with detailed views of exactly where the Premier League is played week in week out. Likewise, Buckingham Palace, the Queen’s London residence, now looks greatly improved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376978/microsoft-flight-simulator-glitches-maps-bugs"&gt;compared to before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z3B3MbOp-9GD6iMlC-C2puTIeGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307296/fgHAFLy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool Football Club in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jLJ_h5P-85xo8PA1hNaTwoPApZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307308/9XwqpKB.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chelsea Football Club in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8G3VHT"&gt;Microsoft is also adding in hand-crafted airports for Barra, Liverpool, Land’s End, Manchester-Barton, and Out Skerries. Another particular part of this update is detailed architectural elements for British manors and Victorian homes. Even countryside stone structures like castles and churches will look a lot better. Some of the views across Scotland look particularly stunning now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acPJH9"&gt;Alongside all the imagery improvements, Microsoft is adding in three new activities for those exploring the UK and Ireland. There’s a new flight in the Northern Isles and two landing challenges: one in the Shetlands and another in the Southeast of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pb64Z"&gt;This new UK and Ireland update is available free for all owners of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;today. It’s a big download, though, weighing in at 48GB on PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GGkFO5nAOrnsUmAJF7szxbdGn4s=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68774775/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5GHXZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 11:21AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bullet list at the bottom now reflects that Asus and Gigabyte have updated all of its product pages with the required information about the RTX 30-series graphics chips its laptops use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emYkbk"&gt;Nvidia is now requiring, not just encouraging, companies selling laptops with its new RTX 30-series graphics chips to be more transparent about the kind of power people can expect. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;these companies will have to disclose specific clock speed stats and total graphics power on online product pages — all of which tells people everything they need to know about a laptop’s graphics potential, for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXHuKd"&gt;However, companies won’t have to mention that these chips are Max-Q variants because, according to an Nvidia spokesperson, “Max-Q is no longer part of the GPU name.” Rather, Max-Q is now solely used to communicate that a laptop with an RTX 30-series graphics chip ships with efficiency features like Whisper Mode 2, Dynamic Boost 2, and Advanced Optimus. Previously, seeing Max-Q branding made it easy to determine a laptop’s general performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2DsTp"&gt;It’s encouraging to see Nvidia no longer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;allows companies to hide this vital information&lt;/a&gt; from marketing materials. It should go far enough in helping buyers make an educated purchase without having to wait on reviewers and early adopters to report on the specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RsrBF"&gt;By sharing these specs, companies can make it much easier for consumers to understand how it’s possible that, in some instances, the RTX 3070 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI’s GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; can outperform an RTX 3080 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, which is something we saw first-hand. Since the Max-Q brand no longer signifies a graphics chip’s power capabilities, being transparent with clock speed and how much power it can consume is more crucial than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7bY5R4IZGgiPi2jLRWNzVa8gRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260491/nvidia_ampere_mobile_gpus_tdp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia now requires companies share the clock speed and power on laptop product pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7RJdo"&gt;“We’re requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the Max-Q technology features for each GeForce laptop, as well as clocks and power — which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system,” an Nvidia spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpvjoM"&gt;Nvidia says manufacturers have already begun sharing this info, including Asus and Gigabyte, which we confirmed at the time of publishing. We’re going to keep tabs on some models coming out soon (and those currently on the market) to see how long it takes for these requirements to roll out across the industry. Let us know in the comments if you notice that one has been updated with info or needs to be added to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser says it’s open to selling its consumer audio business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4CD1eKYi3S1dP_8C_ZhqwE7qxE=/20x0:1685x1110/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825090/CX_400BT_True_Wireless_Product_Shot_In_Use_Black.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sennheiser&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0wAzi"&gt;Sennheiser &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsennheiser-to-reposition-its-business-units-independently-of-each-other-s5jh2n%3Fasset_type%3Dattachment%26asset_id%3Dd88176f4-727f-4f25-8e0b-abe35e9c21e4%23attachment-d88176f4-727f-4f25-8e0b-abe35e9c21e4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285497%2Fsennheiser-investors-selling-consumer-headphones-soundbars-business#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s looking for a new partner to buy its consumer audio business, which consists of headphones and soundbars. It’s going to shift its focus entirely to professional audio, including its Neumann microphone division and what Sennheiser calls business communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJPvJq"&gt;In a press release, Sennheiser says it wants to increase visibility in the competitive headphone and soundbar markets, and it thinks its products can be popular amid “strong competitive pressure.” But it needs an investor to make that happen. It also says that talks with potential partners will start soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMLEHm"&gt;“To be best able to exploit the potential in each of these markets, we are concentrating our own resources on the three business areas in the Professional division and are looking for a strong partner to invest in our Consumer business,” Daniel Sennheiser, co-CEO of Sennheiser, says in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j4Imjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All options are open,” say the Sennheiser brothers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbhGgE"&gt;German publication &lt;a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-konsumgueter/audiospezialist-sennheiser-sucht-investor-fuer-die-kopfhoerersparte/26919186.html?ticket=ST-7274310-DereG1gbH3bE9ifKfmQ5-ap1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handelsblatt &lt;/em&gt;recently posted an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Daniel and fellow co-CEO Andreas Sennheiser, in which the two brothers point to a number of potential reasons why Sennheiser is now exploring selling its consumer business. For one, the company was late to jump onboard with truly wireless headphones, which have become a very popular audio hardware segment. While Sennheiser apparently had record sales in 2019 (€393 million, representing 52 percent of its 2019 sales), it ended up slightly negative after taxes and interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADPz4c"&gt;More recently, headphone sales haven’t been as good as expected. Daniel Sennheiser said during the summer that “competitive pressure has increased significantly,” and its profit margins at the time were “under pressure.” It also cut 650 jobs worldwide, leaving the company with around 2,800 employees currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkz1ac"&gt;Sennheiser’s press release makes it seem like the company is interested in partners to fund its consumer audio business, but it isn’t opposed to selling it off completely. The Sennheiser brothers told &lt;em&gt;Handelsblatt &lt;/em&gt;that “all options are open,” and that “it is important to us that all business areas emerge stronger from the realignment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair grows its roster of streaming brands with Visuals by Impulse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfO7h5Go6HmpcHjnH3fZwReA63s=/0x46:1000x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825069/CORSAIRLogo2020_stack_K.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="24Trih"&gt;Today, gaming peripheral brand Corsair is announcing that it has purchased streaming visuals company Visuals by Impulse (VBI), which it’s organizing under its other streaming brand, Elgato. If reading that makes your eyes cross, don’t worry — all it means is that some of the biggest names in streaming technology have come together under Corsair’s roof. Think of the consolidation like a one-stop shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkW6u8"&gt;It’s a smart move on Corsair’s part, too. The company scooped up Elgato — the biggest name in streaming tech — in 2018, and then a year later, it picked up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708388/corsair-acquiring-origin-pc-custom-build-gaming-software-hardware"&gt;Origin PC&lt;/a&gt;, which makes custom prebuilt PCs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028367/corsair-acquires-scuf-gaming-controllers-origin-pc-elgato"&gt;SCUF Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, which makes custom professional-grade controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDbEBh"&gt;This month’s acquisition of VBI means Corsair now has a complete set of products related to streaming: you can get everything from a streaming PC to a suite of custom visuals under one larger roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BOGNp"&gt;“With the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family, we’re excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators. Design is a crucial element shaping a creator’s identity, and VBI has been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design accessible to anyone,” wrote Julian Fest, SVP and general manager at Elgato, in a press release. “Together with the talented team at VBI, we plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VJi6a"&gt;If nothing else, Corsair’s consolidation is convenient. It’ll be interesting to see what the company buys next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass’ free tier will become a lot less useful next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhufGUw_FLjBf4OolT0OfJOplVM=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68824844/msedge_qX48b5uD4r.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUzPIM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/what-can-i-expect-to-change-for-lastpass-free-on-march-16-2021"&gt;LastPass is adding new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to its free subscription tier starting March 16th that’ll only allow users to view and manage passwords on one category of devices: mobile or computer. Mobile users will be limited to iOS and Android phones, iPads, Android tablets, and smartwatches. Computer subscribers will be able to use their passwords from Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops and laptops, the LastPass browser extension, and Windows tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKoRfZ"&gt;Users on LastPass’ free tier will be asked to pick between the two options the first time they log in after March 16th, and the company says they’ll be able to switch between categories up to three times after they’ve picked. Although customers are restricted to a single category of devices on the free tier, they’ll still be able view and manage passwords from an unlimited number of devices within either the mobile or computer category. LastPass says no users will be locked out of their accounts or lose access to their passwords as a result of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bhQx0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paid tiers start at $3 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="waB1ae"&gt;As well as restricting its device types, LastPass is also changing the kinds of customer support free tier users will be able to access. From May 17th, free users will lose access to email support, the company announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdVzpZ"&gt;LastPass is clearly hoping the new restrictions are enough to encourage people to upgrade to its Premium or Families tiers. LastPass Premium starts at $3 a month, while a Families subscription costs $4 and includes licenses for up to six people. In an &lt;a href="http://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it now has over 20 million users around the world, though it’s unclear how many of these use the service’s free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9vxL8"&gt;Compared to a lot of other password managers, which ask you to subscribe to access even their basic features, LastPass’ free tier has always been pretty generous. But these upcoming changes could make it a lot harder to use the service for free in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This year will be huge for electric cars — here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kCB0zFoZtE-aLMbvgsLci4LZzL8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68824800/VRG_EV_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXNoLL"&gt;2021 is going to be a really big year for electric vehicles. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Findustry%2Fpress%2Fus-electric-vehicle-market-poised-for-record-sales-in-2021-according-to-edmunds.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22280768%2Felectric-vehicles-ev-2021-tesla-cybertruck-hummer-vw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Car-buying experts at Edmunds&lt;/a&gt; expect US sales to grow to 2.5 percent from 1.9 percent in 2020. That’s thanks to more options and growing interest from interested consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA3yY3"&gt;Nearly three dozen EVs from 21 automotive brands are expected to go on sale this year, compared to 17 vehicles from 12 brands in 2020. Notably, this will be the first year that all three major vehicle categories will be represented: there will be 11 electric sedans, 13 SUVs, and six pickup trucks in 2021, whereas only 10 cars and seven SUVs were available last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLewSd"&gt;We thought we’d zero in on seven different EVs coming out this year and talk about what they tell us about where things are headed in the future — for the auto industry, for the climate, and for all of us that need to get around. After all, this wouldn’t be a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video if we weren’t talking about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Like The Mandalorian, WandaVision will get its own documentary on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Anhl2qvLttYKvPBJM3KQ8n2wHc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68824750/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gl7Nl"&gt;Following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221963/mandalorian-disney-plus-documentary-docuseries-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2, &lt;/em&gt;Disney is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232745/wandavision-episode-one-two-recap-theory-sword-shield-age-of-ultron-skrulls"&gt;giving &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; a &lt;/em&gt;behind-the-scenes documentary that will air on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on March 12th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKURYp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assembled: The Making of WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is the first in a new series streaming on Disney Plus that will go “behind the scenes of the series and movies of the MCU,” according to the company. A similar documentary is already available to watch on Disney Plus that examines how the Marvel Cinematic Universe came together, providing a more in-depth look at Marvel Entertainment (specifically the comics) in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsEgMj"&gt;For Disney Plus, this is quickly becoming the norm: release a highly anticipated show or movie, and then pair it with an accompanying documentary featurette or series. How it all exists together is a little clunkier. For example, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;series is housed under the Disney Gallery banner. It’s unclear why &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; — and MCU documentary featurettes at large — wouldn’t exist under Disney Gallery. It’s also unclear just how many people who tune into shows like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;are actually watching the behind-the-scenes specials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhTODf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if the docuseries aren’t watched by millions of people, they’re cheap to make&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YW1c8Y"&gt;On a streaming platform like Disney Plus, having a consistent batch of new content is just as important as the big weekly shows or blockbuster movies. Even if the docuseries aren’t watched by millions of people, they’re cheap to make (the footage is literally collected while the show is being made and may use some subsequent interviews after the fact) and they’re something new for the company to highlight to show there’s new content coming in, even if it’s not &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;a new series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6oZkA"&gt;For diehard Marvel or &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;fans, it’s also a chance to get a better understanding of the world they’ll have spent eight weeks in by the time the docuseries lands. It also just so happens to come out in the week between &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;ending and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Solider &lt;/em&gt;premiering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWlzeH"&gt;Disney streaming executives would like subscribers to know a week won’t go by without new Marvel content if they have anything to say about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fPuFfG"&gt;
&lt;aside id="FI8TTB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends, and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 43 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;In California, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA Covid Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page change monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nhHjOx"&gt;By the way, if you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, because of low supplies of vaccine, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celebrate Pokémon’s 25th anniversary with a matching denim tuxedo from Levi’s</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ze2bVJoNqV_onU5j-yr0t2S32X8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68824680/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Levi’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="388MpC"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise is turning 25 this year, and to celebrate, the brand is teaming up for a number of collaborations, from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274841/mcdonalds-pokemon-cards-anniversary-25-scalpers-ebay-prices-resell-happy-meal"&gt;McDonald’s cards&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone concerts&lt;/a&gt;. And then there’s Levi’s, which is &lt;a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/2021/02/10/a-look-at-the-new-levis-x-pokemon-collection/"&gt;celebrating the anniversary&lt;/a&gt; with a line of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Flevis-x-pokemon%2Fc%2Flevi_clothing_pokemon_us%3Fclickid%3DWK0Qfby0ZxyLWWA0WlXSvXJOUkET3k3jl28Iz00%26irgwc%3D1%26camp%3DIR_2514802_366459&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-branded outfits&lt;/a&gt;, led by the standout floral-print &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-themed denim trucker jacket / jeans combo in what might be the finest example of the &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Canadian_tuxedo"&gt;Canadian tuxedo&lt;/a&gt; ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yz4z1k"&gt;The flashy getup is available as separates: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Fclothing%2Fmen%2Fouterwear%2Flevis-x-pokemon-vintage-fit-trucker-jacket%2Fp%2F773800041&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $128 trucker jacket&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Fclothing%2Fmen%2Fjeans%2Fstraight%2Flevis-x-pokemon-551-z-authentic-straight-mens-jeans%2Fp%2F247670008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair of $148 jeans&lt;/a&gt;, both of which feature a... unique print of various &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; characters darting in and out of a floral garden motif. And while Levi’s shows its models rocking half of the set (presumably as an accent piece for a more restrained outfit), it’s clear the only &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;way to style the outfit is by going all-in on the look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkQ6aeGoQVKQJzt9KrTWUhpgCy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306888/773800041_back_pdp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Levi’s&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Y5QC"&gt;The floral outfits are, admittedly, the boldest of the collaboration. Most of the Levi’s x Pokémon drop is actually fairly pedestrian by comparison: T-shirts and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Fclothing%2Fmen%2Fjeans%2Fstraight%2Flevis-x-pokemon-551-z-authentic-straight-mens-jeans%2Fp%2F247670007&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;jeans&lt;/a&gt; adorned with characters from the show, a set of shorts and a yellow tank top that’s a pair of red suspenders away from being a Misty cosplay, and a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Faccessories%2Fwomen%2Flevis-x-pokemon-pikachu-ears-beanie%2Fp%2F380220292&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knit hat with Pikachu ears&lt;/a&gt;. (There’s also an option to get some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.levi.com%2FUS%2Fen_US%2Fapparel%2Fclothing%2Fbottoms%2F511-slim-fit-mens-jeans%2Fp%2F045114383&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285360%2Fpokemon-25th-anniversary-levis-denim-tuxedo-outfit-merchandise#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;laser-etched &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; patterns&lt;/a&gt; on regular Levi’s jeans for those who prefer a more subtle design.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0gv53"&gt;The new Levi’s merch looks like it’ll be the best way to wear your &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; love on your sleeve — that is, if you don’t count the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556433/pokemon-pod-metapod-costume-pokeshopper"&gt;human-sized Metapod sleeping bag&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
