    <title>Spotify lets passengers fight over your road trip playlist, disturbing natural order of universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhgKUiLUSn6f_YTMN-C9RiScbjM=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949996/Polestar2_US_Launch_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Polestar / Beadyeye&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wrwZXN"&gt;It’s a fundamental rule of the road: driver picks the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8WMy7"&gt;And yet, in a brazen challenge to the immutable laws of the universe, Spotify has chosen to meddle with this golden rule by expanding its Group Session beta to cars. Starting today, up to six people in the car can all control music &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;starting with the Android Automotive-powered Polestar 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPydN5"&gt;“We all know that sometimes the driver doesn’t have the best taste in music and my family tends to agree. The addition of Group Sessions Beta from Spotify is a great way for others in the vehicle to influence the playlist and enjoy their favorite tracks,” commented Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath, a man who clearly cannot be trusted with playlist powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1OCUa"&gt;Group Session rolled out last year as a beta and is limited to Spotify premium subscribers; once a host starts a session, up to five other users can join, giving them full (shared) control over the playlist and the power to play, pause, and skip tracks at will. And sure, it’s a useful feature when you’re hanging out with friends in the low-stakes environments of a barbecue or a dinner party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGxeQg"&gt;Fortunately, there are safeguards: the driver will still apparently have the power to revoke access at any time (because, again, &lt;em&gt;driver picks the music!&lt;/em&gt;). But when it comes the delicate balance of an hourslong road trip, Spotify is still playing with fire here. Do you &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;want to risk your friend bombarding you with Nickelback songs every other track for the entire drive to Pittsburgh? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFgkRb"&gt;That said, the potential descent into carpool chaos is limited, for now. The expanded Group Session beta is &lt;a href="https://www.polestar.com/us/press/press-release/polestar-2-now-features-spotify-group-sessions-beta"&gt;only available in the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; — currently the only car on the market that runs Android Automotive — but presumably, as Google’s smart car platform continues to arrive on more cars in the future, it’ll be more broadly available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFTs, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUwmt6PC9yCHDThvasRp_NBDs7Q=/0x70:1252x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904498/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Wj0"&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3hj8i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405/576" target="_blank"&gt;NyanCat on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter would take a shot at it&lt;/a&gt; just days after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;was auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade to Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;? Also, you didn’t let me finish earlier. That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;ended up selling for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html"&gt;is $15 million more than Monet’s painting &lt;em&gt;Nymphéas&lt;/em&gt; sold for&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeTKAEvLmop3TJky4G1whbuRXB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341209/GucciGhost.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoever got that Monet can actually appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT. deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DjDJOZf5-4jdVe9fHSNlrMuXD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341226/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.43.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0xa20f75be9427995e596788c29a10c7d734671251/5600020053" target="_blank"&gt;deadmau5 and Mad Dog Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uedrnj7kfMuTOKIghiRp4yUtLOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341171/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, they could also end up using a lot of electricity per transaction. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigations for this issue&lt;/a&gt;, but so far they haven’t been implemented yet. There have been a few cases where artists have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacksfilms/status/1369070588136845313?s=20"&gt;decided to not sell&lt;/a&gt; NFTs, or to cancel future drops &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/"&gt;after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXB6fZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpRTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 1:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the news that Beeple’s piece sold for $69 million and added more information to the climate change section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Four years later, we are all BBC Dad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bbc-dad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MqC6B5cOwCis4zqXfPgpXrEaho=/0x0:771x514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949809/personal_space_bbc_dad_kids_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WNT1VP"&gt;Four years ago yesterday, a meme was born: professor Robert Kelly, who will be forever known as “BBC Dad,” had &lt;em&gt;the gall&lt;/em&gt; to get interrupted by his kids during a live video interview &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/asia/bbc-interview-robert-kelly-children-trnd/"&gt;broadcast around the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WNrSuM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you aren’t feeling old yet, here’s the daughter in that video above &lt;a href="https://t.co/meL81Rd0fM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/meL81Rd0fM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1369628467394936832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T20iXn"&gt;I remember thinking: isn’t this just a cute video? Why would anyone drag him for working at home? But of course I’d see things that way, seeing how I’ve spent most of the past decade working from a home office myself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCOsMq"&gt;Initially, BBC Dad had to &lt;em&gt;own it&lt;/em&gt;. He had to lean into the meme, making his kids part of his public persona and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195340/bbc-dad-work-from-home-calls-south-korea"&gt;even featuring them in later interviews&lt;/a&gt;. Even today, he’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trying to explain that yes, he WAS wearing pants at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qlctIs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;like this. It is genuinely the comedy of errors you see in the vid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. You didn't stand up to usher out your kids, bc you weren't wearing pants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no dignity left ‍♂️. I remained seated, bc the show must go on. I'd done enough TV by then to know that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic: James at Xmas &lt;a href="https://t.co/gUOXL04p9h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gUOXL04p9h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Robert_E_Kelly/status/1369804666771447809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66qqfx"&gt;The kids-interrupting-the-call part, though? Not so much. Everyone understands that now. You or someone in your family or circle of friends has &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; BBC Dad, making some hilarious gaff in a work call, counting yourselves lucky &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;your upside-down floating head&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;deep-seated-desire to become a cat&lt;/a&gt; didn’t get shared with the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93smHy"&gt;We’ve lost an awful lot in the COVID-19 pandemic, but one incredibly tiny silver lining is that remote work is better understood now. I don’t need to explain to anyone that my desk is my office, or that kids will magically phase in and out of my video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvqtQv"&gt;Okay, that felt a little somber. Let’s end on a brighter note! &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/06/can-i-have-two-biscuits-the-best-of-kids-interrupting-television-interviews"&gt;Here are more children interrupting live video interviews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>20 Bethesda games will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow</title>

    <title>The Hyundai Staria is the coolest-looking minivan in years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLs-jPQto9v5om6r10Dr7Hm9qVo=/403x614:3775x2862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949721/_Photo_3__STARIA_Premium_EXT.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqvMus"&gt;Minivans are &lt;a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2020/02/minivan-market-share-is-now-at-2-percent-in-america-and-its-rapidly-getting-worse/"&gt;pretty much dead&lt;/a&gt; in the US, but Hyundai’s new Staria looks so slick that it makes me believe there could be a revival some day soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvUhhQ"&gt;Revealed &lt;a href="https://news.hyundaimotorgroup.com/MediaCenter/News/Press-Releases/Hyundai-Motor-Offers-First-Peek-at-STARIA-New-MPV-with-Premium-and-Futuristic-Design-#none"&gt;in teaser images on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the Staria is easily the coolest-looking minivan since the spaceship-styled ones that prevailed in the 1980s. In fact, Hyundai describes the Staria’s exterior as “strikingly futuristic and mysterious ... resembling a spaceship” in the press release, so maybe this is just my personal preference for this style showing. But whether or not you like it, the Staria is certainly one of the most mold-breaking vans that we’ve seen in a long time — especially considering that modern minivans have basically mutated into &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-kia-carnival-first-look-review/"&gt;really large SUVs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyAbdS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10386691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiIh1e"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t provided dimensions, but the Staria is nothing like that. Its stubby nose and exterior proportions seem to more closely resemble the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-nissan-van-taxi-that-will-rule-nycs-streets-is-actually-great/"&gt;Nissan vans that make up part of New York City’s yellow taxi fleet&lt;/a&gt; or a small delivery van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zy7gYE"&gt;But Hyundai has taken that basic shape and given it a retro-futuristic spin that clearly tracks with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;new design language it’s been developing for cars like the forthcoming Ioniq 5 EV&lt;/a&gt;. The interior also looks pleasantly roomy, with big windows and a panoramic windshield that stretches up above the driver’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="font-size"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t said whether the Staria will be electric, or where it will be sold. (More details are expected “in the coming weeks.”) I wouldn’t exactly bet money on the former being true, and given the sad state of minivan sales in the US, it’s not hard to imagine Hyundai being cautious about bringing the Staria here regardless of its powertrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fsMw7"&gt;But one thing’s for sure: Hyundai Motor Group’s designers are pushing the look of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323438/kia-ev6-electric-car-hyundai-apple-platform"&gt;company’s new vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in really daring ways, and the Staria is the latest example. Now if the company could only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;get a handle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/03/09/kia-recall-optima-soul-forte-sorento/4642536001/"&gt;quality assurance&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bumble’s new Night In feature is an attempt to break the ice on virtual dates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMPb9_kf2lvnrCdwWybYJgsQmKM=/113x0:1807x1129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949238/Night_In_Press_w_logo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWxfjD"&gt;Dating app Bumble has announced Night In, a new feature that lets you play games on a virtual date. The feature is available to users in the US and Canada, and the game available at launch is a series of trivia questions you can answer together. However, Bumble says it plans to offer more games and virtual experiences in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USOJAz"&gt;Night In is an expansion of Bumble’s existing video dates feature, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19121374/bumble-dating-app-video-voice-chat-call-first-date"&gt;launched back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The feature has seen a marked increase in demand as a result of the pandemic; Bumble says its voice and video calling features were used 70 percent more after the pandemic started. Hopefully, being able to play a game will act as a nice icebreaker and help mitigate some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;more awkward elements of virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, even if they’ll never match the intimacy of being in the same room as another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9mF730"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bumble added video dates in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8MiuN"&gt;Bumble’s Night In can be organized using the icon in a chat message. The virtual date can be scheduled ahead of time for between 6PM and midnight on any day of the week. Once scheduled, both participants will be sent reminders and notifications by the app ahead of the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlxYM"&gt;Bumble’s video chat features were in place before the pandemic, but other dating apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316317/tinder-face-to-face-rollout-video-calls"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21209801/hinge-video-call-chat-date-from-home-feature-launch"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; have had to rush to catch up over the past year. Although the introduction of these features was undoubtedly influenced by the pandemic, it sounds like they might live on after this current era of social distancing. In a recent survey, Bumble says almost half of respondents in the US said they preferred a first date to be virtual rather than in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqj0KM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvQUYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFgh7D"&gt;If you’ve ever been frustrated by a road simply &lt;em&gt;not existing&lt;/em&gt; on Google Maps, the company’s now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It calls the experience “drawing,” but it’s closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint. The updated tool should be “rolling out over the coming months in more than 80 countries,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/three-new-ways-anyone-can-update-google-maps/?_ga=2.110865477.1901867856.1615485216-809046695.1615485216"&gt;according to a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTXZ9"&gt;Currently, if you try to add a missing road, you can only drop a pin where the road should be and type in the road’s name to submit that information to Google. The new tool should make it easier to not only add missing roads, but to make corrections such as fixing a road’s name or its direction (for example, if the road is one-way but Google Maps says it isn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eiqj_-8RcexSEqLoJYwumqUF1y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361266/Google_Map_edit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new map editor lets users visually add in missing roads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvcz9706AtSAqAifoTJUNShJvzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361359/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.03.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current correction screen is more rudimentary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5pNI"&gt;Of course, Google will still be vetting your corrections to make sure they’re accurate. After you submit a change with the new tool, you’ll see a screen where Google warns that it doesn’t want a bike path to be marked as a road, or for someone to make a road intended to hurt people, for example. That screen also says that it’ll take about seven days for the company to review your submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfd5n"&gt;Google Maps will also be getting a feature called “photo updates” which will let you share small details about a place without having to leave a full review. In the app, you’ll be able add images of a location as well as see recent photos with text snippets others have submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUCJ34xkgfJ6ORb1AcAYh_Rwnfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361222/Photo_Updates_Hero_Image___Updates_Tab.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates should help surface the most recent information about a location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>GM aims to make its electric vehicles go farther and cost less with new battery partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOvO5X-dXZajLLZX7hh8lA82m3o=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949175/GMEVDay04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Steve Fecht for General Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNygFL"&gt;General Motors announced a new joint venture with SolidEnergy Systems, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries. The two companies plan on building a test facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, for a high-capacity preproduction battery by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oiE7Y"&gt;The partnership was announced Thursday by GM president Mark Reuss at a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post Live&lt;/em&gt; virtual conference. Prior to the announcement, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Kent Helfrich, executive director of GM’s global electrification and battery systems, about what the joint venture will mean for the automaker’s plans to electrify its entire fleet of vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgwRqG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1LlWWx"&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost,” Helfrich said. “And it’ll also mean most likely smaller batteries, so a lighter weight vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hbuEb"&gt;When GM first unveiled its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium battery platform&lt;/a&gt; last year, it said the new energy system would enable electric vehicles that could travel “400 miles or more” on a single charge. Last November, the automaker increased the estimated maximum range to 450 miles. The first vehicle to be built with an Ultium battery will be the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says will have an estimated 350 miles of range. The Hummer is expected to go into production at the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu7dBt"&gt;The company is sticking with its estimate of 450 miles of range for now, declining to speculate as to how many more miles it anticipates adding through its battery venture with SolidEnergy Systems. That company has been focused on improving the energy density in li-ion batteries for nearly a decade. According to MIT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cSXyDW"&gt;Founded in 2012 by MIT alumnus and former postdoc Qichao Hu ’07, SolidEnergy Systems has developed an “anode-free” lithium metal battery with several material advances that make it twice as energy-dense, yet just as safe and long-lasting as the lithium ion batteries used in smartphones, electric cars, wearables, drones, and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W1yPLC"&gt;GM is interested in the company’s intellectual property, which includes the manufacturing process for lithium metal anodes and electrolytes to improve the battery’s overall life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A8Eqle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Anode-free” lithium metal battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ITodtK"&gt;Despite its name, SolidEnergy still works with liquid electrolytes and does not consider itself a “solid-state” battery company. Solid-state systems have been the subject of intense focus from the auto industry in recent years, as companies seek to develop EV batteries that will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKeT8o"&gt;While the focus of this joint venture with SolidEnergy is the production of “wet” li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes, GM is looking closely at solid-state technology for the future. “Is our advanced team also looking at solid state type technology? Absolutely,” Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology, said. “We wouldn’t leave anything off the table at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gwu9SE"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-batteries/gm-says-it-is-almost-there-on-million-mile-electric-vehicle-battery-idUSKBN22V2FS"&gt;a top GM official said&lt;/a&gt; the company was “almost there” on developing an electric vehicle battery that will last 1 million miles. Speaking to a group of investors, GM executive VP Doug Parks wouldn’t specify a timeline, but said “multiple teams” at the automaker are working on such advances as zero-cobalt electrodes, solid-state batteries, and ultra-fast charging. Typical EV batteries today last up to 100,000 to 200,000 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JtHD"&gt;GM has been an investor in SolidEnergy Systems since 2015 through its venture capital arm, but it isn’t the only battery startup to attract the automaker’s interest. In 2010, GM invested &lt;a href="https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/g-m-ventures-invests-3-2-million-in-battery-company/"&gt;$3.2 million in a Michigan-based company called Sakti3&lt;/a&gt; that was working on solid-state batteries. The automaker is also in talks to construct a second massive battery factory in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhOLVD"&gt;But GM isn’t the only company to view advances in EV batteries as a way to accelerate the future in which zero-emission vehicles replace all of the gas-guzzling cars on the road today. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla announced&lt;/a&gt; its own plan to take more control over its battery-making process. And next week, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/09/vw-tesla-like-battery-day-produce-cells-spain/"&gt;Volkswagen will unveil its own vision&lt;/a&gt; for EV batteries during its virtual “Power Day” event. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on how Facebook’s focus on growth stopped its AI team from fighting misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISLUwsBpJSPwzNeuULDvD_FjH2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949135/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQpWBY"&gt;Facebook has always been a company focused on growth above all else. More users and more engagement equals more revenue. The cost of that single-mindedness is spelled out clearly in &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;this brilliant story from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It details how attempts to tackle misinformation by the company’s AI team using machine learning were apparently stymied by Facebook’s unwillingness to limit user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1LTzI"&gt;“If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored,” writes author Karen Hao of Facebook’s machine learning models. “But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DI9Ty"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibchUl"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_KarenHao/status/1370008460918743045"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Hao noted that the article is not about “corrupt people [doing] corrupt things.” Instead, she says, “It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing. But they’re trapped in a rotten system, trying their best to push the status quo that won’t budge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOURCQ"&gt;The story also adds more evidence to the accusation that Facebook’s desire to placate conservatives during Donald Trump’s presidency led to it turning a blind eye to right-wing misinformation. This seems to have happened at least in part due to the influence of Joel Kaplan, a former member of George W. Bush’s administration who is now Facebook’s vice president of global public policy and “its highest-ranking Republican.” As Hao writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tCJ6qq"&gt;All Facebook users have some 200 “traits” attached to their profile. These include various dimensions submitted by users or estimated by machine-learning models, such as race, political and religious leanings, socioeconomic class, and level of education. Kaplan’s team began using the traits to assemble custom user segments that reflected largely conservative interests: users who engaged with conservative content, groups, and pages, for example. Then they’d run special analyses to see how content-moderation decisions would affect posts from those segments, according to a former researcher whose work was subject to those reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYL5Hb"&gt;The Fairness Flow documentation, which the Responsible AI team wrote later, includes a case study on how to use the tool in such a situation. When deciding whether a misinformation model is fair with respect to political ideology, the team wrote, “fairness” does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean the model should affect conservative and liberal users equally. If conservatives are posting a greater fraction of misinformation, as judged by public consensus, then the model should flag a greater fraction of conservative content. If liberals are posting more misinformation, it should flag their content more often too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yQK6y"&gt;But members of Kaplan’s team followed exactly the opposite approach: they took “fairness” to mean that these models should not affect conservatives more than liberals. When a model did so, they would stop its deployment and demand a change. Once, they blocked a medical-misinformation detector that had noticeably reduced the reach of anti-vaccine campaigns, the former researcher told me. They told the researchers that the model could not be deployed until the team fixed this discrepancy. But that effectively made the model meaningless. “There’s no point, then,” the researcher says. A model modified in that way “would have literally no impact on the actual problem” of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjb9kb"&gt;The story also says that the work by Facebook’s AI researchers on the problem of algorithmic bias, in which machine learning models unintentionally discriminate against certain groups of users, has been undertaken, at least in part to preempt these same accusations of anti-conservative sentiment and forestall potential regulation by the US government. But pouring more resources into bias has meant ignoring problems involving misinformation and hate speech. Despite the company’s lip service to AI fairness, the guiding principle, says Hao, is still the same as ever: growth, growth, growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MTBQnQ"&gt;[T]esting algorithms for fairness is still largely optional at Facebook. None of the teams that work directly on Facebook’s news feed, ad service, or other products are required to do it. Pay incentives are still tied to engagement and growth metrics. And while there are guidelines about which fairness definition to use in any given situation, they aren’t enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qSYdPq"&gt;You can read Hao’s full story at &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soon you’ll be able to buy a one-foot-tall figurine of ChilledCow’s lo-fi chill beats anime girl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxUfn7EGMDU717v3Tygsh2d4J9w=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949041/youtooz_lofi_hip_hop_radio_beats_to_relax_study_to_girl_1_ft_figure_release_info_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Youtooz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5o6O"&gt;Jesus. Okay. Look, I like capitalism as much as the next schmuck who blogs for a living, but what is going on right now with regard to the efficient allocation of the Earth’s precious resources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1bFKK"&gt;Let me paint a word picture for you. Youtooz, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262329/stonks-vinyl-figurine-gamestop-dogecoin-reddit"&gt;the company that made a stonks guy figurine&lt;/a&gt;, has now created a one-foot-tall version of the lo-fi chill beats anime girl, complete with desk and study materials. You know her; she’s always studying while you’re listening to said beats. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2F2021%2F3%2Fyoutooz-lofi-hip-hop-radio-beats-to-relax-study-to-girl-1-ft-figure-release-info&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325348%2Fyoutooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the figurine drops for public consumption on April 2nd at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dpWHF"&gt;In theory, I like whatever’s going on here. Before it became something of a meme, lo-fi chill anime beats to work and study to was an inaccurate description of the post-Nujabes diaspora — you know, the stuff that Jun Seba did on &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure&lt;/em&gt;, the soundtrack to Shinichirō Watanabe’s brilliant anime. Whatever happened between 2004 (when the TV show and the record were released) and now must have been pretty traumatic; the sound wended its way through innumerable producers and turned into something like Muzak — &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/28274/muzak-history-background-story-background-music"&gt;music to be productive to&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5pNDT"&gt;Anyway, we’re in the deep end now. Over on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;ChilledCow&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most recognizable channel for lo-fi goodness, streaming as they do to tens of thousands of listeners at any given minute on any given day. And yes, Youtooz’s figurine is a replica of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perpetually studying anime girl. It looks cool; she has a backpack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMOpdN"&gt;But that still doesn’t answer my question. I guess it doesn’t matter? I do love the statuette, but I’m not sure it needs to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Najtpq"&gt;Whatever. Do Canti from &lt;em&gt;FLCL&lt;/em&gt; next, cowards. &lt;/p&gt;
