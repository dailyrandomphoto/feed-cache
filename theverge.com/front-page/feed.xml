    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yZ4iP4"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a discount on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10/dp/B07K2HBB1H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Fire HD 10&lt;/a&gt;, now is a good time to buy. Amazon is selling the tablet, which includes 64GB of storage, for only $108 today, the lowest this configuration has gone down to on the site to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZc1UD"&gt;Alongside USB-C compatibility, the Fire HD 10 includes expandable storage of up to 512GB via microSD, longer battery life than smaller models, and a 10.1-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Microsoft wants Discord</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dATN8-0Qg8JHtAOR_wuPsyBYqCo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029836/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Community, community, community&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qEXmUZ"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly having discussions with Discord to buy the communications app. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-is-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-discord-11616715164?mod=searchresults_pos1&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is in “exclusive talks” to acquire Discord, and a deal could close next month. It’s the latest acquisition target for Microsoft, after the company failed to acquire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277845/microsoft-pinterest-acquisition-azure-cloud-services-rumors"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; recently. While all three are very different services, they share one common element: community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj4BjU"&gt;Microsoft is willing to spend big on these services because, outside of Xbox, it doesn’t have a huge consumer-facing community like rivals Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple do. Microsoft has watched Google acquire YouTube and turn it into the world’s biggest video platform, Amazon buy Twitch and dominate streaming, Facebook acquire both Instagram and WhatsApp to control the way millions communicate and socialize online, and Apple rule mobile with its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wquO4n"&gt;Discord gives Microsoft access to a growing list of more than 140 million monthly active users that includes thousands of top YouTubers, creators, and gamers. Microsoft wants its own community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o4QfCvg9LhIuJHfzHPFWAy44uMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399428/489dc2b446be5c305571ad96b845c776.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord runs across PC, Mac, mobile, and the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ysuyPi"&gt;A creator community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaozud"&gt;“Creation, creation, creation — the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it, so it’s not creating alone,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/microsoft-ceo-hunts-anew-for-creator-hub-in-discord-after-tiktok-bid-fails"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “If the last 10 years has been about consumption — we’re shopping more, we’re browsing more, we’re binge watching more — there is creation behind every one of those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY240k"&gt;Nadella was quick to focus on creators and communities in the first year of being CEO at Microsoft. One of his first big acquisitions was Mojang, the studio behind &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;with its millions of devoted fans. Nadella has also spent big to acquire other communities, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920072/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-2016"&gt;LinkedIn costing $26.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal"&gt;GitHub for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub was a key target to buy developer love and a huge community, and LinkedIn connected Microsoft more deeply to businesses and provided access to a significant professional social graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjuJGK"&gt;Microsoft has clearly been on the hunt for the same type of creator-led community on the consumer side, but TikTok and Pinterest didn’t work out. The software maker has also failed elsewhere. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/11/12446962/microsoft-beam-live-game-streaming-acquisition"&gt;acquired Beam&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years after Nadella was named CEO, and eventually rebranded it into its Mixer streaming service. Microsoft tried to compete with Twitch but ultimately failed because it didn’t have the broad consumer reach. Instead, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down Mixer&lt;/a&gt; last year and helped transition streamers over to Facebook Gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDht4a"&gt;Discord offers Microsoft a big and engaged community. Primarily used by gamers, it has become a Gen Z hub for socializing with friends, particularly during the pandemic. It consists predominantly of private communities, and Discord has 6.7 million active servers every single day. It’s a huge community, 75 percent of which are Discord users outside of North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWQnOX"&gt;It’s also become an essential tool for many over the past year. I’ve personally used Discord daily to keep in touch with friends, or participated in remote movie nights, streamed games, and just used the app as a place to hangout. Millions use &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to hangout and play together, and Discord is the primary way these communities of friends talk and chat while they’re gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7VGj"&gt;Discord is a great mix of Slack messaging and Zoom video, combined together with a unique ability to just drop into audio calls freely. You don’t have to organize a time to call friends, or send them links, you just all jump in and out of voice channels that are always ready and open. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocPBBjxWFezrTlqXCIIcbq0ghSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399430/882599fca31a23ad38bd47db302b2a00.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s easy drop-in chat has made it popular among gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cKjTGY"&gt;Azure and Xbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UU2OUe"&gt;The community and creator aspects for Microsoft’s potential Discord acquisition are clear, but the company is also driven by its desire to have big public services running on Azure. It’s an area where Microsoft has fallen behind rival Amazon Web Services (AWS), and it’s particularly relevant when you consider Discord is powered by Google Cloud. Microsoft and Google are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327306/google-microsoft-attack-open-web-online-news-australia-laws"&gt;at each other’s throats again&lt;/a&gt;, so Microsoft migrating Discord over to Azure would be seen as a big win for its cloud ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZy5Ch"&gt;Microsoft has also transitioned &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;from AWS over to Azure recently, and the company quickly moved Outlook for iOS (part of its Acompli acquisition) away from AWS years ago. Having a big platform like Discord, TikTok, or Pinterest running on Azure allows Microsoft’s huge sales force to sell more businesses on making the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFeRUF"&gt;Discord also has growth potential for Microsoft beyond the cloud. Discord &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat"&gt;raised $100 million last year&lt;/a&gt; to try to move beyond just gaming and attract art communities, sports networks, school clubs, and lots more. This all sounds very similar to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;Microsoft is trying to do&lt;/a&gt; with Microsoft Teams for personal use, after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;struggled to have its own Zoom moment with Skype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOukTx"&gt;Discord does open up Microsoft to moderation headaches, though. Discord created a task force to combat hate speech on the service last year, alongside improving its own racial equality efforts. Like many social networks, it has had to combat toxic users, bots, and groups that use the service for hacking, organized hate, and other nefarious activities. Discord does benefit from the fact it doesn’t try to amplify content to keep users engaged like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. Microsoft has a lot of solid experience dealing with moderation with its Xbox Live network, and the company has been on a mission to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913323/microsoft-xbox-live-content-filters-messages-party-chat-moderation"&gt;combat toxicity in gaming&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZTShqPnLTqp0Ci-dT9z51Ahq_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15957232/0fe20042_0bb8_4781_82f4_7130f928b021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft has been a successful acquisition for Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nU2tDK"&gt;If Microsoft is successful in its acquisition attempt, the crossovers between Discord and Xbox are obvious. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt; the importance of Discord as a place “where people come together to talk about games, watch games, watch others play games.” That should have been Mixer, but the user base wasn’t there. A Discord acquisition could tighten the integration between Xbox, PC, and Discord, at a moment when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;consoles are basically turning into powerful PCs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOh9Vy"&gt;Spencer has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965239/xbox-project-scarlett-price-performance-ps5-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;open to “cross-talk” between Xbox Party Chat and Discord&lt;/a&gt; for years, and it’s reasonable to assume it would be a priority for Microsoft to bring Discord to Xbox if a deal goes ahead. This type of integration would only make Xbox more appealing than PlayStation, just as Microsoft’s $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325757/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-acquisition-game-pass-exclusive-games-phil-spencer-comment"&gt;designed to boost Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; with exclusive games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tUfPtN"&gt;Beyond that, I think Microsoft has learned to let its successful acquisitions flourish independently. Skype is a solid example of what goes wrong when Microsoft attempts to integrate a complicated service into its vast network of software and services, but GitHub, LinkedIn, and Mojang have all stayed largely independent. Microsoft wants Discord because of its active user base; the last thing it needs to do is anger a community of millions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NZXT’s first AMD motherboard is sleek and packed with USB ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61hWvTx94a4EegLUJ2fONlx5ikY=/211x139:1527x1016/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029705/large_a967c02fc2cff54e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The motherboard is available in either white (pictured) or black.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1VxH77"&gt;NZXT’s first AMD motherboard is the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzxt.com%2Fnews%2F242&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F26%2F22351974%2Fnzxt-amd-motherboard-b550-usb-ports-shroud-price-pcie-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;N7 B550&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzxt.com%2Fproducts%2Fn7-z490-matte-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F26%2F22351974%2Fnzxt-amd-motherboard-b550-usb-ports-shroud-price-pcie-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel versions&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it, the N7 B550 has a slick design with the option of either a black or white shroud that covers the bulk of the board itself. No doubt NZXT hopes the motherboard’s clean appearance will make it an appealing option for anyone with a windowed PC case like NZXT’s own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzxt.com%2Fcategories%2Fh-series-refresh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F26%2F22351974%2Fnzxt-amd-motherboard-b550-usb-ports-shroud-price-pcie-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;H series cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3aHb5"&gt;Beyond its looks, the N7 B550 appears to offer very capable performance if a &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/nzxt-n7-b550/3"&gt;review from &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by. Designed in collaboration with established motherboard manufacturer ASRock, the motherboard uses the B550 chipset which works with both AMD Ryzen 3000- and 5000-series CPUs and offers PCIe 4.0 support. Integrated fan and RGB controllers mean the components can be managed through NZXT’s Cam software. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9B2A4yI6E16d84R90o06TDbdqAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399371/b550_io_d92b5d5b1225be8eb16487cfbbfea78ce6304e4030e0c35280b12c1669883fb3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NZXT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N7 B550 offers a good array of USB ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VvJBIR"&gt;In terms of connectivity, there’s an impressive 10 USB ports available on the rear of the motherboard, including a USB Type-C port, and two M.2 slots for NVMe storage. Wireless connectivity includes support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Check out the &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/nzxt-n7-b550"&gt;review from &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for a full spec and performance rundown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqeNKN"&gt;It’s a solid debut for a company that’s typically better known for its PC cases and CPU coolers, although its reputation was dented earlier this year when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287950/nzxt-h1-pc-mini-itx-case-recall-cpsc-gamers-nexus-nylon-metal-fire-hazard"&gt;it had to recall one PC case&lt;/a&gt; over fire safety concerns. The N7 B550 is available now for $229.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to type special characters on a Windows PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyFfDbSg1BrFhmUnbhFSkzciu-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029603/mchin_190527_4449_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings. It’s not difficult to add them to your Windows document, although it’s not quite as smooth an operation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347140/apple-mac-special-characters-how-to"&gt;as on a Mac&lt;/a&gt;, where all you have to do is hold the appropriate key down. (In fact, once upon a time, you would have had to look up the symbol character codes...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2UXCI"&gt;Use the touch keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cK212s"&gt;The easiest way to add diacritical marks to a document is to enable the Windows touch keyboard. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-get-easy-access-to-symbols-emojis-and-other-special-characters/"&gt;Ed Bott from &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for first leading me to this method.) The touch keyboard automatically appears if you’re using a Windows tablet or if you’re using a PC in tablet mode. If you don’t have a touchscreen, you can use the keyboard icon that appears in the taskbar, on the right side near the date. Don’t see it? This is how you get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3mKSNx"&gt;Right click on the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="guGqAk"&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show touch keyboard button” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zX5tGpTALETlEtcWIgb7syaRgx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397964/special1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="isigzU"&gt;Now, when you want to use a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MiArSp"&gt;Click on the touch keyboard icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vkiOjM"&gt;The touch keyboard will appear. Long press (with your mouse button or, if you have a touchscreen, your finger) on the letter you want to use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mxWCG7"&gt;You’ll now see several extra keys showing the ways you can type that letter with different symbols. Select the one you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YsM2S5"&gt;If you want to enter an emoji, click on the emoji key (on the left of the “space bar”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ianQf8kqWF7MLYr-Jkzt0fc99TM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397970/special3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blWVk1"&gt;Use the character map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MX8CIZ"&gt;If you’d like to try a more old-fashioned method of adding special characters to Windows, you can use the character map, which is a less polished and more complicated version of the touch keyboard but offers a similar service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcyqh"&gt;To access it on your Windows 10 system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QyOOxs"&gt;Type “character” in your search field and then select the Character Map app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2thjaB"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up map showing a bunch of special characters for a specific font. You can change the font by clicking on the drop-down font menu at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7GknZWGbXmLDWNLFDoIqxsW84U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397981/special4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4Xgqtz"&gt;Click on the letter(s) or special characters that you want to use in your document and then click on the “Select” button. They’ll appear in the “Characters to copy” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XN5Maf"&gt;Once you’ve selected all the characters you want, click on the “Copy” button and then paste the character(s) into your document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBy3k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lijM38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly mulls rugged smartwatch coming as soon as this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DczjLJO3poLVFwPEhIihrFy_Us0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029498/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Series 6, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gpB3nN"&gt;Apple is internally discussing releasing a rugged version of its Apple Watch designed for use in “extreme environments,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/apple-considers-launching-rugged-watch-for-extreme-sports?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The company is said to have considered a release as early as later this year, or 2022. If released, the watch could offer similar core functionality to the regular Apple Watch, but with a more rugged construction such as a rubberized exterior. The report also notes that Apple is planning  new swim-tracking features for its watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRytNh"&gt;Although the company’s existing watches are already popular for exercise tracking, and are water-resistant to up to 50 meters, they’re not considered to be durable enough for extreme sports like water skiing without additional protection. This has allowed other smartwatch companies like Suunto and Garmin to find a foothold in the market with more specialized devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zhdS5O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A rugged alternative&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HT4Mdl"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has considered releasing a more rugged version of its Apple Watch at least once before, after the release of the original model back in 2015. But the plans never made it into a consumer device, and there’s every chance the current plans could end up being cancelled or delayed. If released, however, the new rugged model would be offered alongside the traditional Apple Watch models, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;low-cost Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; the company released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtpWmy"&gt;Apple tends to release new smartwatches in the second half of the year. As well as the Apple Watch SE, last year the company released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt;. However, its improvements were so iterative we didn’t think it was worth upgrading for anyone who already owns a Series 4 or Series 5 watch. A rugged version, meanwhile, could offer a much more substantial reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtZMcf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX rocket debris creates a fantastic light show in the Pacific Northwest sky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IH_WeZ-F83iqOndDN_2Pi34Tz_A=/0x34:720x514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029435/space_x_pacific_northwest_falcon_9_debris.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footage of the debris from Cornelius, Oregon. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Rasmusse007/status/1375303605356355586" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Rasmussen / @Rasmusse007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Hfq9e"&gt;Stargazers in Oregon and Washington were treated to an unexpected show last night: what looked like a meteor shower streaking lazily across the night’s sky that was very likely the remains of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, burning up as it travelled through the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnMcVg"&gt;Although SpaceX has not yet claimed responsibility for the spectacle, numerous meteorologists and astronomers ID’ed the lights in the sky as harmless rocket debris. (You can seen plenty of videos of the event in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375301028514500615"&gt;replies to this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BH5tFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we got lucky and it came right over head.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bnrrr"&gt;“We got a really good show tonight thanks to SpaceX,” James Davenport, an astronomer from the University of Washington, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ekJanB4cjUk"&gt;told NBC-affiliate &lt;em&gt;KING5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This was the top end, what we call the second stage, of a Falcon 9 rocket. It was actually launched about three weeks ago and it did exactly what it was supposed to do: it put satellites in orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykQarb"&gt;“The only failure it had was it didn’t complete its de-orbit burn, so it didn’t come down when and where we expected it. It’s just been waiting to fall for the last three weeks and we got lucky and it came right over head.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OfPwAh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekJanB4cjUk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DrGwYZ"&gt;The Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage rocket. The first stage, housing nine of SpaceX’s Merlin engines, does the initial heavy lifting, getting the rocket off the ground, while the second stage, with just a single Merlin engine, guides it into a parking orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Keondh"&gt;The first stage can be steered back down to Earth, and it’s this section of the rocket you’ve probably seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15489586/spacex-falcon-9-nrol-76-rocket-landing-success"&gt;safely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11787532/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-landing-success-sea-drone-ship"&gt;landing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127630/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-landing-failure-ground-cape-canaveral"&gt;or sometimes not&lt;/a&gt;!) on SpaceX’s drone ships. The second stage is usually left to decay in orbit or directed to burn up in the planet’s atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpdP2f"&gt;This particular launch &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-17-launch-success-8th-landing"&gt;took place on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;, putting another batch of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites into orbit, with the first stage of the rocket safely landing back on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SpaceX falcon 9 landing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_F3UjKQRZPw6D9jr6HS53_Gym50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/5846469/spacex-falcon-9-landing.0.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon 9 rocket is constructed from two stages. The first can be safely landed back on Earth (as seen above) while the second is usually directed to disintegrate in the atmosphere. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vsO46H"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375324175620055043"&gt;tweeted a thread&lt;/a&gt; about the event, noting that this sort of debris re-entry is not uncommon. “This is the 14th piece of space junk with a mass over one tonne that has reentered since Jan 1st this year,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375329641225981953"&gt;said McDowell&lt;/a&gt;. “In other words, about one a week. Plus lots more smaller bits of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyeupo"&gt;McDowell notes that it can be tricky to predict the timing of these re-entries. The debris breaks up high in the atmosphere, around 40 miles or 60 kilometers above the ground — that’s well above the cruising altitude of commercial flights (around eight miles or 12 kilometers up). But the combination of headwinds in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and the speed of travel (the debris is moving at around 17,000 mph) make it difficult to predict exactly when and where re-entry will take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i2iCh4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Falcon 9 second stage from the Mar 4 Starlink launch failed to make a deorbit burn and is now reentering after 22 days in orbit. Its reentry was observed from the Seattle area at about 0400 UTC Mar 26. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQrBrUoBHh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQrBrUoBHh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375301028514500615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4)  But remember it's going 17000 mph, so a 5 hour  time uncertainty  means an 85,000 mile (53000 km) location uncertainty. That's more that one entire loop around the Earth. That's why we couldn't tell in advance that it would be the Seattle area that would see the reentry.&lt;/p&gt;— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375325270236930052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyZa8V"&gt;The National Weather Service (NWS) of Seattle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSeattle/status/1375304832446173186"&gt;also identified&lt;/a&gt; the bright lights as debris from a Falcon 9 second stage. The NWS noted that the speed of such debris re-entry is much slower than that of meteor showers, which move at speeds greater than 45,000 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITP393"&gt;Such re-entries are generally safe, with all rocket components and material burning up in the atmosphere. As Seattle’s NWS tweeted: “There are NO expected impacts on the ground in our region at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEJ0Y8"&gt;Right now, it seems like the only lasting effect will be a lot of fantastic footage like the video below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CO04eq"&gt;

    <title>Razer is actually making its concept RGB face mask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clCOEAucMemU7QFiBqCrIcwBvkc=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029337/razer_mask_smaller.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXSvkp"&gt;Razer says it’s planning to ship its concept reusable N95 face mask. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Unveiled back in January&lt;/a&gt;, Project Hazel includes active disc-type ventilators, Chroma RGB lighting, and voice projection. The face mask is also transparent, allowing for lip-reading and the ability to see facial cues when you talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kSny2"&gt;“We were thinking, this is a concept project and is this going to be relevant when vaccinations and everything has been rolled out,” says Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan in an &lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/razer-confirms-its-concept-high-tech-face-mask-project-hazel-will-be-turned-into-reality-135826312.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are going to proceed in making it a reality and ship the smart mask.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3KjRX-efLPJe61wtmzLNC--d64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228416/hazelhero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Project Hazel mask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5nStOu"&gt;Razer’s smart mask made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;surprise debut at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with detachable and rechargeable ventilators and a glossy outside shell made of waterproof and scratch-resistant recycled plastic. The ventilators also act as voice amplifiers, thanks to microphones embedded inside so you don’t sound muffled while speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFxsyR"&gt;The Chroma RGB lighting allows the two ventilators to glow, and even automatically shine light onto your mouth when it gets dark, so others can see you speaking. It’s a smart mask that’s loaded with tech, but Razer insists that it’s comfortable to wear thanks to adjustable ear loops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR6GOMeCKt3NTuyN5VZqV75liN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399320/QTPjtwr.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8oNYY9"&gt;Razer hasn’t committed to any type of pricing or a release date, and the company will also need approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That’s not stopping Razer from making this smart mask real, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pey7KZ"&gt;“Project Hazel is going to be a reality,” says Tan. “We are going to make it happen and I think we will all be, unfortunately, wearing masks for a long time to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube demonetizes David Dobrik’s channels over sexual assault allegations  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgDDdk"&gt;YouTube has temporarily demonetized multiple David Dobrik channels after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-demonetizing-david-dobrik-following-vlog-squad-scandal-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of Dobrik’s channels have been demonetized; David Dobrik, David Dobrik Too, and the channel for his video podcast, Views. As well as Dobrik’s channels, YouTube has also demonetized Durte Dom, the personal channel of the ex-Vlog Squad member at the center of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfElQl"&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “We have temporarily suspended monetization on David Dobrik and Durte Dom channels for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgEN1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47Y84t"&gt;The video platform is the latest organization to take action against Dobrik after the allegations emerged in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. In it, a woman featured in a 2018 vlog said that the former Vlog Squad member engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. Footage from the night of the incident was later published in a since-removed YouTube video titled  “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyb00"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB734hc89x8"&gt;most recent video&lt;/a&gt; addressing the controversy, Dobrik apologized for his role in the incident. “I want to apologize to her and her friends for ever putting them in an environment that I enabled that made them feel like their safety and values were compromised. I’m so sorry.” Dobrik also confirmed he took the decision to stop filming with the former Vlog Squad member in 2019. “I fully believe the woman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sycRhp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2021/3/23/22346231/david-dobrik-advertisers-assault-allegations-old-videos"&gt;More than a dozen advertisers&lt;/a&gt; have cut ties with Dobrik after the report emerged, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook. Dobrik has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;parted ways with disposable camera app Dispo&lt;/a&gt;, an app he co-founded in 2019, in light of the allegations. The app has lost investors including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373855197831720963%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22344171%2Fdavid-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;Spark Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/david-dobriks-dispo-loses-another-investor-the-ceo-of-lime-2021-3?r=ts-sub"&gt;Lime CEO Wayne Ting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s next batch of free PS4 and PS5 games is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_u8IAsok-nWoh1Az572Zgo-3AQ=/191x0:1712x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69028679/48302575152_20b194477a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yrk4Q0"&gt;Sony’s “&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/play-at-home/"&gt;Play at Home&lt;/a&gt;” initiative continues with a huge stack of excellent games, including &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Subnautica&lt;/em&gt;, that are free to own for a limited time. No PlayStation Plus membership is required, meaning you can keep these games forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS2gG1"&gt;From now through April 22nd at 11:59PM PT, the following titles will be free to claim for PS4 and PS5 users: &lt;em&gt;ABZÛ,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Rez Infinite, Subnautica,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moss&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thumper&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paper Beast&lt;/em&gt;. The last four games require a PSVR headset to play. PS5 owners will need a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/"&gt;PlayStation Camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; to use the headset with the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9VpIQ"&gt;Sony plans to offer more games as part of the initiative until sometime in June. Currently, Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;offering &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which PS4 and PS5 owners can redeem at no cost until March 31st. The company is also planning to give away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336370/horizon-zero-dawn-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; for free&lt;/a&gt; beginning on April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The black-and-white Snyder Cut is definitely black-and-white and definitely still 4:3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ixgROnsrYJ9cmESjkK-XD4UiZY=/0x16:1093x745/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69028154/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_4.38.22_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SkMLe"&gt;Well, that didn’t take long. &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt;, the black and white version of the film that hews closer to the director’s ideal vision for his superhero epic, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1374981675248128000?s=20"&gt;is out today on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. Justice is Gray’s release &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1373424594787446786?s=20"&gt;was first teased last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDRcjz"&gt;Outside of the notable lack of color, the film still streams in its now familiar 4:3 aspect ratio, which if anything, I’ve fully come around to since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;the initial hullabaloo&lt;/a&gt; around the “integrity-preserving” choice. Your mileage with the new black and white color scheme, on the other hand, may vary. The dramatic death that opens the film plays a lot stranger when Batman and Wonder Woman seem like they’re watching from some kind of grayscale blur, rather than the original film’s blasted-out ruins. You can judge the potential loss of detail for yourself with WarnerMedia’s new clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wzdxot"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For years, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnyderCut?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnyderCut&lt;/a&gt; existed in black and white and shown only to a select few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack Snyder's Justice League: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JusticeIsGray?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#JusticeIsGray&lt;/a&gt;, a black and white version of the film, is now streaming on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos on supported devices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3c40221N27"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3c40221N27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Snyder's Justice League (@snydercut) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1374981675248128000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7USzU"&gt;Like the original release, &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt; is available with all the modern bells and whistles you’d expect, like 4K, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision (though now handling a less obviously HDR-appropriate grayscale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2RRY1"&gt;The one part of the film that hasn’t gotten a new coat of paint? That HBO Max disclosure that plays at the start:&lt;/p&gt;
