    <title>The Keychron Q1 is an enthusiast-quality keyboard right out of the box</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A solid build and easy customization make the Q1 easy to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="A111Yk"&gt;Keychron’s new mechanical keyboard, the Q1, has achieved something very impressive. It’s taken the kinds of features and level of quality normally reserved for expensive, assembly-required custom keyboards sold in limited runs, and made it available in a single, beginner-friendly package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3cb1p"&gt;Those high-quality features include support for open-source firmware that allows the keyboard’s layout and functionality to be endlessly customized, hot-swappable switches that let you change its typing feel without having to do any soldering, and a level of construction that’s miles ahead of most mainstream keyboards at this $169 price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAkQra"&gt;It’s this focus on a more premium construction that’s new territory for Keychron, a company that’s made a name for itself offering relatively affordable mechanical keyboards packed with user-friendly features like wireless Bluetooth connectivity and convenient support for both Mac and Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur7Gto"&gt;The Q1 sits halfway between Keychron’s mainstream roots and these more premium custom keyboards. It’s not wireless, and it’s also not as affordable as Keychron’s previous keyboards. But it’s also a package that you should eventually be able to buy without the kind of hassle and lead times that can come with many niche keyboard purchases. Keychron might not be a household name in the same way as Corsair or Logitech, but browse &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/"&gt;its site&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll find that most of its keyboards are currently in stock and ready to ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb38mU"&gt;It all makes the Keychron Q1 a very easy mechanical keyboard to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KswNmv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10740932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkHoVq"&gt;The Keychron Q1 is a 75-percent aluminum keyboard, which means it has about as many keys as a typical laptop keyboard, including a function row. It’s available as a complete package for $169 in black, gray, or blue, with matching ABS double-shot keycaps. Otherwise, you can opt for a $149 bare-bones model that doesn’t come with switches or keycaps, but that only saves you $20 which doesn’t seem worthwhile to me. Unless you’ve already got switches and keycaps lying around, I’d personally just go for a fully assembled version. You can easily swap out both the caps and switches later, and hardware to easily remove both is included in the box, no soldering required. One exception is if you’re in Europe and want an ISO version of the keyboard — this version is only available as a bare-bones kit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rs4XA"&gt;The Q1’s design will look instantly familiar to anyone who’s laid eyes on a GMMK Pro, a popular keyboard released earlier this year. One notable difference is that at the moment the Q1 doesn’t have the option to install a rotary knob on its top right, which the GMMK Pro includes to act as a volume control, but which can also be remapped to fill a variety of other functions. Keychron says it will eventually sell a version of the Q1 with a similar rotary knob in October for $179, but it’s not available at launch and won’t be available as an aftermarket upgrade for existing Q1s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7Ssf2"&gt;Instead, on the top right you have the option of including an extra key or swapping it out for a small square plate with a &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/customize-your-keychron-q1"&gt;design of your choice printed on it&lt;/a&gt;. I’d prefer the extra key, personally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K7QtyGCfo0vOmRNkzfCiYrqSg3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832615/jporter_210906_4744_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A simple toggle switches the keyboard between its Mac and Windows modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IcyLj4_UHWaGur6r42rCVI-Sfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832614/jporter_210906_4744_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A solid aluminum case with no height adjust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZMAhC"&gt;Rounding out the physical tour, on the top left you’ll find a physical switch to put the keyboard in its Mac and Windows modes (keycaps for both come in the box, as is standard with Keychron’s keyboards). On the bottom there are four feet to stop the board sliding around on a desk, but there are no height adjustable feet. Their absence didn’t bother me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1saSKk"&gt;The Q1’s design and construction is a pretty big departure from Keychron’s previous keyboards, which have been made out of cheaper, lighter materials but have also included user-friendly extras like Bluetooth support and height-adjustable feet. The Q1 might not be as feature rich, but its overall build quality is on another level from Keychron’s other boards. I generally think it’s a mistake to equate “heavy” tech with “high-quality” tech, but in this case the Q1’s heavy-duty construction absolutely makes it feel more premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4T8POmwR-Y6WE4krHCvzdkDrO3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832616/jporter_210906_4744_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An aviator cable, if you’re into that sort of thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbwXUf"&gt;Spend any time on mechanical keyboard forums and you’ll quickly discover that there are a host of mods people like to make to their keyboards, either to make them feel nicer to type on, sound better, or just look plain cool. What’s special about the Keychron Q1 isn’t that it’s doing anything particularly new, but that it comes with a number of the most common mods applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP5QJu"&gt;Its USB cable is the most obvious example. One of the easiest modifications most people make for their keyboards is to replace the boring USB cable that comes in the box with something more interesting, maybe covered in a nice braided fabric, curled into a coil, or with a completely excessive aviator connector halfway down the line. Well, that’s exactly the cable that comes as standard with the Q1. I’ve never personally been a fan of over-engineered cables like these, but judging by users on Reddit, I’m in the minority. At least it doesn’t affect the way the cable works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J19Cmo"&gt;Elsewhere, there are more examples of typically aftermarket mods being included as standard. Look at the Q1’s Gateron-manufactured screw-in PCB stabilizers (the mechanisms under longer keys like the spacebar that stop them from wobbling), and you’ll see that lube has been applied to reduce their rattling, which is another tweak people recommend for your keyboard. I imagine most enthusiasts will want to tweak the amount of lubricant to get exactly the sound they prefer, but for me the amount that came applied did a great job at reducing the clatter they can otherwise produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uPGgz8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get a very fancy coiled USB-C cable in the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="apOngb"&gt;The Gateron “Phantom” switches that come with the board also have lubricant applied, in the hope of making them feel smoother to type on. The switches are available in a typical selection of linear red, tactile brown, and clicky blue varieties, and I used the brown versions for the majority of my time with the board. Despite the Phantom branding, it was hard to tell the switches apart from regular Cherry MX Browns, with that ever-so-slight tactile bump that you either love or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc32Fv4P0tw"&gt;absolutely hate&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a proud member of the former group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbag9V"&gt;The most common modification people tend to make to their keyboards is with the keycaps, and unfortunately I don’t have an answer for you about whether Keychron’s stock keycaps can live up to the quality of aftermarket alternatives. I didn’t get a review sample of the ABS caps that Keychron provides with fully assembled versions of the Q1. Instead, I’ve been using one of &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/q1-k2-oem-dye-sub-pbt-keycap-set/products/q1-k2-oem-dye-sub-pbt-keycap-set-gray-white-blue"&gt;Keychron’s $40 sets&lt;/a&gt; made out of a more durable PBT plastic. They’re not perfect, but for this price, I think you could do a lot worse. I have no problems with the durability of the keycaps, but look closely and you’ll see that the printing of their legends isn’t great, and there’s a kind of haziness to them that almost looks like the ink is bleeding out into the area around each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYH2rh"&gt;In contrast, ABS (which is what the keycaps that actually come with the keyboard are made out of) generally has a reputation for being less durable than PBT, thanks to the way it can develop a shine over time with use. But considering they only come in at a $20 premium alongside a set of switches, I think it makes sense to grab a set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sntK1ekSyRlkrTFjlf6XjhEv6ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832611/jporter_210906_4744_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keychron’s $40 PBT keycaps are good, not great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOB0f8sTpMS1wdPmFQFuJow1fcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832610/jporter_210906_4744_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C cable attaches to the top left of the board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xSmfqE"&gt;No compact keyboard layout is going to be perfect for everyone, so it’s great that the Keychron Q1’s layout is completely customizable. Better yet, it’s customizable thanks to its support for QMK, a powerful open-source firmware standard that’s compatible with a plethora of different configuration software. Keychron recommends using the &lt;a href="https://caniusevia.com/"&gt;software Via&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/blogs/archived/how-to-use-via-to-program-your-keyboard"&gt;configure the Q1’s layout&lt;/a&gt;, which is generally a well-designed and user-friendly piece of software to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nwHwL"&gt;The one criticism I have about the customization process is that it’s a little unintuitive how it works when you’re using the keyboard in its Windows mode. If you want to alter the layout used when the keyboard’s in its “Windows” mode (there’s a small switch labeled Mac / Windows on the top left of the board), you’ll need to adjust “Layer 2” in Via or your QMK software of choice, which isn’t obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c114ky"&gt;The Q1 also technically has an RGB LED built into each one of its switches, but this is not the keyboard to get if you want an obnoxious glowing object on your desk. None of Keychron’s keycap options have any transparency to allow light to shine through them, and the case itself doesn’t leave much room for light to shine through. You’re left with what small amount of light is able to bleed through the thin gaps between the keycaps, which suits me just fine as someone who turns off the lighting on every keyboard he uses anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gYoe0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its RGB lighting is barely visible in most conditions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3lvcEr"&gt;There’s a lot going into the typing experience of the Keychron Q1. There are the aforementioned pre-lubed switches, as well as the fact that its circuit board is mounted on a gasket rather than being screwed into the case, giving it a slight amount of flex as you type. And then there’s the keyboard’s heavy 3.5Ib (1.6kg) construction, which keeps it firmly planted on your desk as you type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KJyeT"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to know which of these deserves most of the credit for the overall feel of the Keychron Q1. All I know is that this keyboard offers the best out-of-the-box typing experience of any keyboard I’ve ever used, and it’s in a different league from most mainstream keyboards at this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KfhfD"&gt;Typing has a wonderfully crisp and clean feel to it, accentuated by the lack of rattle coming from the space bar. I think it sounds great to type on with the tactile brown switches I’ve been using. It’s the kind of keyboard that’s a joy to use every single day, regardless of whether you’re writing thousands of words of copy, gaming, or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="F1Cnua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10740943"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTrm8d"&gt;I think a lot of people are going to be very happy with the way the Keychron Q1 feels as stock, but it’s also a pretty easy keyboard to mod yourself. Keychron provides a small Allen wrench in the box, which grants easy access to the internals of the keyboard via the eight screws on its underside, and there are extra gaskets and foam if you want to experiment to get a different sound and feel from the board. It’s a fairly painless process to disassemble the keyboard, though you’ll need to be careful about the small ribbon cable that connects the main circuit board to the smaller board that houses the USB-C connector. Ultimately, this feels like a keyboard that’s designed to be taken apart, unlike many other keyboards which have scary-looking warranty stickers that you have to break to access key screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J7OsqJ0_IgIjUyrAXwJxG86dIG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832618/jporter_210906_4744_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard technically comes with RGB switches...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sb4HUz6jdaMpDXi8m68qabCLO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832620/jporter_210906_4744_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but you’d be hard-pressed to see them in most situations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MUmfZG"&gt;Halfway through writing this review, a colleague sent me a message asking for a keyboard recommendation, and without hesitating I recommended the Keychron Q1. Short of being wireless, it basically does everything you could want from a compact mechanical keyboard. It’s easy to swap out its switches, it’s easy to customize its layout, and it’s a dream to type on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji3Sww"&gt;The Q1 has been compared to the kinds of custom keyboards that can cost multiple hundreds of dollars, and nearly all of which require some assembly by the end user. But obviously it’s never going to be better than these boards, not out of the box. Not because of any lack of build quality, but because it’s that little bit of self assembly that truly tailors a custom keyboard to your exact needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9aw0my"&gt;With a little work, a little bit of lube here, or some switch upgrades there, I’m sure the Q1 could approach the level of quality of some of these custom boards, and Keychron’s design is happy to accommodate tinkerers. But I think what’s most impressive is how close the Q1 gets as standard. It’s an amazing keyboard for someone who just wants to buy something fully assembled and without a lengthy waiting period. Unless you’re dead-set on a wireless keyboard or you need the extra keys afforded by a larger model, the Keychron Q1 is an easy choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ world championships will take place in Iceland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="League of Legends – 2020 Worlds - Finals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e2lquR0-uoWz2NL7Ugm-Cc5mz-8=/1x0:5200x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834107/1283223716.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Lee/Riot Games/Riot Games Inc. via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZVevw"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, the concluding tournament that brings together the best teams from across the world, will take place in Reykjavík, Iceland at the Laugardalshöll indoor sporting arena. Riot Games &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/worlds-2021-location-and-format-announcement/blt52ec273a991d3261"&gt;revealed the news today&lt;/a&gt;, following the August announcement that the event would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638914/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-moved-china-europe"&gt;moved from China to Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The event kicks off on October 5th and will conclude on November 6th. No fans will be in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZORva"&gt;Reykjavík was also this year’s location for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s other big international tournament, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303379/league-of-legends-iceland-lol-mid-season-invitational-valorant-champions-riot-games"&gt;the Mid-Season Invitational&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in May. “Riot successfully hosted the Mid-Season Invitational this past May in Hall B at the Laugardalshöll without a live audience, which resulted in zero COVID-19 cases among players, staff, and partners,” the company noted in today’s announcement. “While maintaining our focus on ensuring the health and safety of everyone involved in hosting, producing, and competing at the event, Worlds 2021 will not host a live audience. We will continue to use guidance from various health organizations and local and national authorities to prioritize everyone’s safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G38e8p"&gt;Alongside the reveal of the host city, Riot also detailed a schedule for the tournament. The early play-in stage will take place from October 5-9th, followed by the group stage from October 11-18th. This will lead into the quarterfinals starting on the 22nd, semifinals on the 30th, and finally the championship match on November 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46Firz"&gt;Riot usually puts on dazzling technological showcases for Worlds; previous events have featured an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;AR concert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;concerts with holograms&lt;/a&gt;. For the early stages of last year’s event, which had no fans, Riot still created spectacle by using massive LED screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;to create an impressive mixed reality stage&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you’ve never watched &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; before, it might be worth tuning in to this year’s Worlds to see what technological wizardry Riot Games has up its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbPB3J"&gt;Worlds isn’t the only esports event that’s been affected by the pandemic in 2021. The International, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s big event, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;was moved to Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt; from Stockholm, Sweden, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643253/overwatch-league-owl-2021-playoffs-hawaii"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League canceled its in-person playoffs in favor of an online competition in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s leather AirTag loop drops to its lowest price yet at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pg9xEVET5CJSJ3SY6tFVfsv0o7Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834105/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s leather AirTag loops are finally on sale. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zhNQnQ"&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessories are, ironically, often more expensive than the Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth tracker itself. Today, however, you can pick up a leather AirTag loop in either brown or red at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PNC7S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $29&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price Amazon has sold the accessory for since its release in the spring. That’s a great thing given the nature of AirTags, which controversially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack a lanyard hole&lt;/a&gt; that would make accessorizing so much easier and likely cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRRM"&gt;The Apple AirTags Leather Loop is made from tanned leather and normally retails for $39. The stylish case allows you to clip your AirTags to backpacks, keys, and other accessories, while securely holding your AirTag in place. There are other third-party options available that are more affordable — Nomad &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14527713?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-leather-loop-rustic-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells similar-looking leather loops&lt;/a&gt; for $25, for example — but this could still be a worthwhile deal to consider if you’re a big Apple fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Z1a4VP"&gt;Outfitted with Apple’s scissor key switches, the keyboard works well with both the iPad and various Mac models. It also features a floating design and a Lightning port, allowing you to top off the rechargeable keyboard after about a month of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JYVg0G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANoE9m"&gt;The newest Hisense 4K TVs are already relatively affordable, which is why their current discount, which runs up to $250, is such a great deal. Prices start at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Premium-75U6G-Quantum-Compatibility/dp/B091YM7DP5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$480 for the 50-inch model&lt;/a&gt;, with the larger 75-inch model going for $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Premium-75U6G-Quantum-Compatibility/dp/B091YK9W9S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (temporarily out of stock, but the deal is still available) and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHIS75U6G%2FHisense-75-Inch-U6G-Series-4K-ULED-Quantum-HDR-Smart-Android-TV-75U6G-2021%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22662055%2Fapple-airtag-loop-hisense-4k-tv-asus-gaming-mouse-playstation-xbox-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,250. BuyDig’s deal is especially attractive, as the discount also comes with an extended four-year warranty. The cost is slightly higher from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxglaJ8lo5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at $1,150.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOPGYw"&gt;After in-depth testing, the &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/u6g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review site &lt;em&gt;Rtings.com&lt;/em&gt; concluded&lt;/a&gt; the 4K Android TV is packed with features that should please most people. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; also praised the &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hisense-u6g-uled-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;excellent image quality&lt;/a&gt; and the fact it offers a wide selection of streaming apps thanks to its incorporation of Google Play. The TV also comes with support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10+, and Google Assistant, as well as four HDMI ports and a voice-enabled remote. If you’re a gamer, however, you may want to look elsewhere, as the entry-level model doesn’t boast advanced gaming features such as HDMI 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eTGnqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10739604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R14HS3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus ROG Keris at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for an all-time low of $68, about $32 less than its typical $100 price tag. The sturdy, lightweight mouse boasts 78 hours of battery life and USB-C charging, and it can provide up to 12 hours of gameplay on a single, 15-minute charge. The peripheral also comes with replaceable side buttons, a 16,000 DPI sensor, and a 70-million-click life span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tPsHOp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="OqWFMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lC7Ffh"&gt;More of a PlayStation fan? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! You can enjoy complimentary PlayStation games every month and exclusive sales on new releases with an annual subscription to PlayStation Plus, which is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgamepilot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for several dollars off with discount code &lt;strong&gt;HITMAN4PSPLUS&lt;/strong&gt;. Typically $60 a year, Eneba’s limited-time deal knocks the price down to $36, though, depending upon payment fees, the total could come out to be closer to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6oRl9"&gt;It’s a worthy investment for gamers given the savings the membership offers. PlayStation Plus comes with other perks, too, including access to online multiplayer and the PlayStation Plus Collection, which allows you to download &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, and a host of other classic PS4 games without any additional fees. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix: Resurrections trailer is finally here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFR5hwfo6CUb3K-VVEApFqIMPRY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834037/matrix_resurrections_trailer_pic.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YUoE2T"&gt;The long-awaited trailer for the fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; installment is finally here alongside the film’s official title: &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections.&lt;/em&gt; The trailer for &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; was first previewed at a CinemaCon presentation from Warner Bros. Pictures on Tuesday, August 24th, in Las Vegas before being released to the public today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRZl9L"&gt;The trailer features clips of Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Neil Patrick Harris playing the role of Neo’s therapist. “Am I crazy?” Neo asks, as his pre-awoken Thomas Anderson persona. “We don’t use that word in here,” Harris’ character replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OZR1WP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s time to fly” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYlCzu"&gt;The trailer also depicts what is widely suspected to be a young Morpheus (played by franchise newcomer Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) telling Neo that “it’s time to fly” while handing him a red pill (though Fishburne himself was &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/laurence-fishburne-in-conversation.html#_ga=2.54469992.1368255391.1629876116-1101500005.1612619158"&gt;not asked&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; sequel). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EEruLxjjhECCeVPs1jQBDrdBPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836627/rev_1_MX4_TRLR_0012_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the name of the coffee shop in the background: Simulatte. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jWsEc4WTdZRh2EGOQmLHmhYBHjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836626/rev_1_MX4_TRLR_0002_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss will reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eicu0M"&gt;The trailer is full-on nostalgia for &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fans. There are black cats, fights in dojos, high speed action sequences (on a train instead of a highway), fight scenes in corridors, bullets being stopped in mid-air, and Neo must once again follow a woman to learn the truth, only this time, the white rabbit he’s trailing after isn’t just a tattoo on her shoulder, but also Jefferson Airplane’s classic song pumping along as blue pills spill into a sink. Explosions? Oh yeah, and plenty of physics-defying karate kicks, too. We’re also left to ponder what’s real and what’s simulated along a shifting timeline in true &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYMsE7"&gt;“After all these years, to be going back to where it all started... back to the Matrix,” says another new addition to the franchise, Jonathan Groff, as the trailer ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jpzm7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; is written and directed by Lana Wachowski, who co-directed and co-wrote the first three Matrix films with her sister Lilly Wachowski. The film is scheduled to premiere exclusively in theaters on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQC1M7"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660926/the-matrix-resurrections-teaser-red-blue-pill"&gt;fans were treated to a unique teaser website&lt;/a&gt; that presented different tiny snippets of the trailer depending on when you logged in — and, of course, whether you chose the red or blue pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PZOoGq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Matrix: Resurrections teaser presents fans with a familiar choice","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660926/the-matrix-resurrections-teaser-red-blue-pill"},{"title":"Here’s what The Verge wants out of a fourth Matrix movie","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Marvel Unlimited relaunches with exclusive phone-optimized comics and a fresh new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA0l1QXVYm5-fQ2pfG6gfWehuL4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834003/marvel_unlimited.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTCyop"&gt;Marvel Unlimited — the company’s all-you-can-read subscription comics service — is getting overhauled today with a new logo, an updated app, a more streamlined design, improved search, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yC9vXk"&gt;And as part of the relaunch, Marvel is also announcing an addition to the service: “Infinity Comics,” a new line of exclusive comics that have been specifically designed for the vertical form factor of a modern smartphone, with scrolling panels that fill the entire width of a phone or tablet screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORixHi"&gt;Marvel is investing big on Infinity Comics, too. It’ll launch with 27 comics available today, with plans for over 100 by the end of the year. Infinity Comics will be exclusive to Marvel Unlimited subscribers, but they’ll be fully in-universe (meaning that anyone who wants to keep up on the full adventures of Marvel’s superheroes will want to make sure to check them out). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1mnFDV4HtSmCxs6304_OCmMSaE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836596/MU_DEVICE_GIF_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A scrolling Infinity Comic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10ZgBZ"&gt;There are some big names attached to the project, including the Jonathan Hickman-led &lt;em&gt;X-Men Unlimited &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Skottie Young’s &lt;em&gt;Giant-Size&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Little Marvels.&lt;/em&gt; Infinity Comics will also feature new Captain America, Black Widow, Amazing Fantasy, Deadpool, Shang-Chi, and Venom / Carnage comics, with plans to roll out new issues on a weekly basis. For now, Infinity Comics are only available on the Marvel Unlimited apps on iOS and Android, although the company plans to add a web reader for subscribers in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvE9MB"&gt;While Infinity Comics are the biggest change, Marvel Unlimited is also getting a fresh design to go with it. The design is an almost Netflix-style look that features a big marquee for major events and tie-ins, scrolling carousels of recommended content, storylines, characters, and creators, and new reading guides for guiding newcomers to comics or for following a crossover event. The Marvel Insider loyalty program is also now integrated into the app, where members can earn points for starting (and finishing) comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5aLlZCI-XDvYXeHKZN7XK_WR-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836566/1080x1080_Creator_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7GNsHOWjcM9FMMsOWFngoH7a-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836565/1080x1080_Character_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Feht5y"&gt;The relaunched app also aims to make browsing and following comics and creators easier and more enjoyable. Starting today, subscribers will be able to locally download an unlimited number of comics, instead of the previous limit of just 12 issues. Users will also be able to save an entire series or run of issues to their libraries with one tap, instead of having to laboriously save individual issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn3xKO"&gt;Another major addition is the ability to follow specific comics, creators, or characters. If you’re a fan of Al Ewing’s &lt;em&gt;Immortal Hulk&lt;/em&gt; line, for example, you’ll be able to follow Ewing and get notified whenever he has new books out on the app. Or if you want to keep up with every Spider-Man comic, you’ll be able to follow the character and easily find whenever there’s a new book available. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tid5TQXlUgjgdRfVMtv_-3tBfdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836562/1080x1080_Downloads_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Unlimited now allows for unlimited downloads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07Kroo"&gt;As of today, Marvel Unlimited features over 29,000 comics and costs $9.99 a month or $69 a year, which makes it a pretty good deal for Marvel fans looking to read absolutely every Marvel comic. That said, despite the relaunch, Marvel is still keeping the service’s biggest caveat: it operates on a three-month delay from when comics are first published in print and digital to when they’re available for subscribers in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1GGdB"&gt;In addition to the redesign, Marvel Unlimited is including a new subscription tier. The “annual plus” subscription costs $99 year and has a few extra perks, including membership kits, promises of in-person event invites, and a 10-percent discount code at Disney’s online shop. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon starts making its own TVs with new Fire TV Omni and 4-Series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0wL36iIzO6E99C-S3lJEBXKKGw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833905/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kt3yTi"&gt;Amazon is officially in the TV business. The company has announced its first lineup of Amazon-branded 4K Fire TVs, which will begin shipping in October. This is a major expansion from the company’s “Fire TV Edition” collaborations, where its popular streaming software comes preloaded on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607331/amazon-best-buy-toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-f50"&gt;sets manufactured by other TV makers&lt;/a&gt;. But with its new Omni and 4-Series, Amazon is describing these as “Amazon-built TVs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEGsn7"&gt;The Omni series is the higher-end of the two, and beyond offering better picture quality, its other key selling point is hands-free voice control. Amazon includes far-field microphones in each model of the Omni series, which comes in 43, 50, 55, 65, and 75 inches. (Only the 65- and 75-inch models have Dolby Vision, but the others at least get HDR10.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTOdb"&gt;The company believes that by building the TV itself, it can create a more seamless Fire TV user experience than ever before. That’s led by the content-forward Fire TV interface and wide app selection, but Amazon believes that Alexa voice controls add a major convenience factor. On Omni sets, voice commands are always available — even if the TV is off. These voice commands can be used for finding something to watch, like always, but you can also adjust the TV’s brightness, volume, or switch inputs with Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRib6K"&gt;Amazon says that over the last two years, customers who used voice features engaged with content twice as much as those who didn’t. And always-listening mics are becoming more common on TVs; Sony already makes some models with them, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;TCL recently introduced new Google TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will ship with far-field microphone arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpTTbQ"&gt;The Fire TV Omni sets also include picture-in-picture for checking your smart home cameras, and you’ll see your Ring doorbell feed whenever someone is at the door. Amazon says it will be adding a “smart home dashboard” later this year for more comprehensive controls over your connected home gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIsK3E"&gt;Here are other new features that are in the works for Fire TV, which will come to these TVs and the company’s other streaming devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0tRtxv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, what should I watch?”:&lt;/strong&gt; Need a new source for great movie and TV recommendations? Alexa Conversations for Fire TV allows you to ask Alexa for a recommendation just like you would a friend or movie expert. Alexa offers tailored TV show and movie recommendations from your favorite streaming apps like Prime Video, allowing you to refine searches by genre, actors, award-winning movies, and more, all from the comfort of your couch. “Alexa, what should I watch?” will launch in beta this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYBbHV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, Play Something” from Netflix:&lt;/strong&gt; Exclusively available on Fire TV and debuting this fall, Netflix is making it easier to find something to watch. Netflix members love the “Play Something” feature today, and soon you can simply say, “Alexa, Play Something on Netflix” from the Fire TV home screen and Netflix will launch a show or movie you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6kbtj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, play TikTok”:&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV was the first to support TikTok videos on streaming media players in the UK, Germany and France, and soon, you’ll be able to access TikTok content in the U.S. and Canada. No more huddling around a cell phone to see the latest viral video&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;from your Fire TV, you can view and discover TikTok feeds and use AutoPlay, which will serve a continuous content feed without interruptions. Just say, “Alexa, play TikTok” to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zS6VVD"&gt;If you already own Echo speakers like the Echo Studio (or a pair of regular Echos), those can be wirelessly linked to Omni-series TVs to provide richer audio than the TV is otherwise capable of on its own. This Alexa home theater audio mode supports streamed content, but Amazon says it also works across cable boxes, gaming consoles, and over-the-air antenna programming. It’s a feature that’s also available on the cheaper Fire TV 4-Series sets. Amazon says a pop-up will appear in the Alexa app for compatible sound devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNc-KKESps_w746c6hY46OMktxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836518/Fire_TV_4_Series_front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV 4-Series doesn’t have far-field microphones and instead includes an Alexa Voice Remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0idpZG"&gt;Amazon might call these “Amazon-built” TVs — and the company’s advanced far-field mic tech is definitely present — but it’s also very likely that Amazon has struck partnerships for much of the other hardware here. I’m almost certain that TCL is manufacturing one or both of these TV lineups. They definitely have that TCL look to them, and the port layouts between something like the TCL 6-Series and Fire TV Omni are nearly identical:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_z9sxd-fLMCdM6sBgpaHFLls4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834622/HDMIcomparo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: TCL / Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 6-Series Roku TV (left) and Amazon’s Fire TV Omni (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mTqNL1"&gt;If that’s the case, these aren’t TCL’s latest and greatest panels: Amazon’s Fire TVs lack HDMI 2.1 features like 4K at 120Hz, though they do support auto low-latency mode — which Amazon says will also help the responsiveness of its Luna cloud gaming service. Amazon also isn’t really going into specifics about whether they’ve got full-array local dimming or other display tech details. Similar to the existing roster of Fire TV Edition sets, the prices for Amazon’s first TVs reflect a focus on providing a good, if not top-tier picture for your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0PtWo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire TV Omni Series pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NanHoE"&gt;75-inch: $1,099.99 (with Dolby Vision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uHvPxZ"&gt;65-inch: $829.99 (with Dolby Vision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ioGUjp"&gt;55-inch: $559.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8rwqKb"&gt;50-inch: $509.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eSb4Fe"&gt;43-inch: $409.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cPArUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire TV 4-Series pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hbkt6b"&gt;55-inch: $519.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fsX23C"&gt;50-inch: $469.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FvJyr6"&gt;43-inch: $369.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gGvAV0"&gt;Alongside its first “self-built” TVs, Amazon and Best Buy are also announcing more Fire TV sets from Toshiba and Pioneer. Toshiba’s models, coming in spring 2022, will integrate far-field microphones, and Pioneer will release budget-priced 43-inch and 50-inch sets. (This is “Pioneer” in branding only, which might be hard to swallow for those who fondly remember the Pioneer Kuro plasma from many years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MfkgN"&gt;In some ways, the Omni and 4-Series represent Amazon’s most ambitious step into the living room yet. But even for customers who aren’t shopping for a new TV, the company’s goal remains having a Fire TV product for everyone. Between these TVs, streaming sticks, and products like the Fire TV Cube, Amazon’s lineup is getting quite expansive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max adds Wi-Fi 6 and faster performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfZNWFTy154pj-MZ9NXdqdfN9HI=/0x146:2040x1506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833896/Fire_TV_Stick_4K_Max.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMC707"&gt;Amazon is today introducing a new flagship streaming stick that joins the Fire TV Stick 4K, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt;, and Fire TV Stick Lite. Dubbed the “Fire TV Stick 4K Max” (&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;) and priced at $54.99, the company’s latest device has improved processing power, more memory, and also adds speedier Wi-Fi 6 wireless networking. Plus it maintains wide support for HDR formats including Dolby Vision. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders start today&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon currently shows a delivery date of October 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GAyd1"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 40 percent faster than the Fire TV Stick 4K, and Amazon attributes those gains to its new quad-core 1.8GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. It’s also now got a faster 750MHz GPU, and Amazon has added auto low-latency mode to help get the best possible performance out of its Luna cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHsjxK"&gt;Amazon claims Wi-Fi 6 is something that can’t be found in streaming gadgets for under $179. (That’s a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;the 2021 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re wondering.) The company thinks it’s a significant addition for more robust, reliable streaming. In another first for Amazon’s Fire TV lineup, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max has received Energy Star certification. Its low power mode has improved to use 15 percent less power than the low power mode on the existing Stick 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKcmQL"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max comes with Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote — now with branded shortcut buttons — and runs the refreshed, content-focused software experience that rolled out across the Fire TV lineup earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoJGXA"&gt;Amazon says the Fire TV Stick is the best-selling streaming player in the United States, so it’s trying to keep that momentum going strong with this new model that still manages to come in under the $60 mark. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Luna is expanding to Fire tablets and Chromebooks, and retro games are on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6IaM4liiiGUD9DHKO2-D0czOjM=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833902/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wZdJo8"&gt;Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;didn’t exactly impress us&lt;/a&gt; when it debuted in early access last October, but the company’s &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/lunaupdate"&gt;still expanding its test&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday, it’s bringing its limited catalog of games to Chromebooks and Amazon Fire tablets, and opening up some new ways to try the service without paying its $6 or $15 monthly fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ak2KSf"&gt;Technically, the service is still in early access — most people have to request access to play, and only in the contiguous United States. But Amazon’s extending its immediate approval signups to its own Fire tablets, the same way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298746/amazon-luna-expanding-fire-tv-devices-invite-only"&gt;it extended them to Fire TV devices&lt;/a&gt;. By the way, there’s a new one of those today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22427026"&gt;Amazon also just announced its new Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a special auto low-latency mode for Amazon Luna that might help with performance. You can buy it bundled with a Luna Controller for $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKCuqo"&gt;But even if you don’t have an Amazon device, the company’s making Luna easier to try. There’s a new “Luna Couch” mode that lets you accept an invite code from a friend to play local multiplayer games including &lt;em&gt;Team Sonic Racing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2 &lt;/em&gt;even if you aren’t a subscriber. And until September 15th, Amazon will let anyone with a Prime account in the contiguous US play &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Katamari Damacy Reroll&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; for free, no need for a Luna account at all. The company says that promotion should be available &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/luna/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMKtf-9b9mJsHFIC6oyN232frVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835973/Amazon_Luna_Couch_Code.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luna Couch lets you share a “couch code” to quickly invite someone else to a game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LyiSp7"&gt;And if $6 a month for Amazon’s standard “Luna+” collection of games is too much to ask, there’s a new $2.99 a month Family Channel today you could subscribe to instead. Amazon describes it as “a curated collection of games appropriate and approachable for gamers of all ages” with 35 games, including “&lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Garfield Kart – Furious Racing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Otter Charlie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DreamWorks Dragons: Dawn of New Riders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;,” and a title called &lt;em&gt;Skatebird&lt;/em&gt; coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLERhf"&gt;You should also know that the price of Amazon Luna’s Ubisoft channel is going up on September 30th, though, to $17.99 a month. If by some chance you’re a lapsed subscriber, you’ve got until the 29th to lock in the current $14.99 per month pricing in time for the day and date releases of &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Riders Republic &lt;/em&gt;in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eabWi7"&gt;There’s also a new retro gaming channel coming “soon,” with pricing TBD, that will include &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Lair&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;King of Fighters&lt;/em&gt;, and others from publishers like Atari and SNK, according to Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 teaser gives first real-world look at the upcoming phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0cbAxukO4kFJ6C-w_HAhFCDzDgU=/2x0:2159x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833619/msedge_1F6PdUaNul.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBfFyK"&gt;Google has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pixel 6 that includes several shots of the smartphone being used in the real world. The footage comes a little over a month after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;released its first official images&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming device, which were limited to renders rather than actual photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcAqUL"&gt;Over on its Instagram page, Google has also teased the phone in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTkyMwagXN9/?utm_medium=share_sheet"&gt;new post&lt;/a&gt; which may give some hints about when its official launch might take place beyond “this fall.” As &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/09/google-teases-the-pixel-6-and-its-possible-launch-date-in-new-ads/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the clock widgets in these images show the date as “Tue 19th.” And yes, the 19th of October falls on a Tuesday. That’s a little later than when Google announced the Pixel 5 last year (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21456181/google-pixel-5-features-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;September 30th&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s definitely the right ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3EburS"&gt;

The Pixel 6 is coming in two versions. There’s a Pixel 6 Pro which will have a 6.7-inch 120Hz QHD+ curved display, and three rear cameras including an ultrawide and a 4X optical-zoom folded telephoto lens. Meanwhile the regular Pixel 6 will have a slightly smaller 6.4-inch 90Hz FHD+ flat display, and no telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s first original film is Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HBZQo9qNmbZps-Z19zjJFmORPno=/210x0:1152x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833522/3ac7d8d7_a351_4c4e_87a1_ab129ef28ee8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TxBKp"&gt;Roku’s first feature-length film is &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt;, a TV movie based off the NBC show &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/09/the-roku-channel-inks-deal-for-lionsgate-s-zoey/ja-etsog-1631082817"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The film will be available free on the ad-supported Roku Channel in the US this holiday season, as well as in Canada and the UK. The film will be directed by Richard Shepard (who directed the show’s original pilot), and written and executive produced by the show’s creator Austin Winsberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlzV9e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt; marks the latest step in Roku’s foray into original content, which kicked off with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;acquisition of defunct streaming service Quibi’s&lt;/a&gt; library earlier this year. Since then it’s launched its own &lt;em&gt;Roku Recommends&lt;/em&gt; show, and has ordered additional seasons of ex-Quibi shows &lt;em&gt;The Most Dangerous Game&lt;/em&gt; and Kevin Hart’s &lt;em&gt;Die Hart.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQMMSU"&gt;“We are absolutely thrilled to call ‘Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas’ our first Roku Original film and make it available to both longtime fans and new ones on The Roku Channel this holiday,” said Roku’s head of original scripted programming Colin Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LaWoGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are absolutely thrilled to call ‘Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas’ our first Roku Original film”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky27JF"&gt;Historically Roku has best been known for its inexpensive streaming hardware, and to a lesser extent the smart TV OS it provides to TV manufacturers like TCL and Hisense. But the Roku Channel is part of its increasingly important advertising business, and the company’s CEO Anthony Wood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595384/roku-ceo-anthony-wood-ads-hardware-business-interview-business-model"&gt;has been pretty open&lt;/a&gt; about seeing Roku’s future as an ad-focused company rather than a hardware-focused one. Earlier this year, Roku acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308141/roku-nielsen-video-advertising-business-acquisition-linear-streaming-tv"&gt;Nielsen’s video advertising business&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to build out its ad tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6j8hb"&gt;In addition to the new film, Roku says that all 25 episodes of &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt; will be available to stream on The Roku Channel in the US “later this fall.” The show originally ran for two seasons on NBC, before being cancelled earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4elDm7"&gt;As well as Roku-branded hardware, The Roku Channel is available on the web, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, select Samsung TVs, Now devices, and Sky Q, depending on your country. &lt;/p&gt;
