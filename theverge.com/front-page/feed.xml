    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available in store at Best Buy tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZNp0N"&gt;For the most part, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have been sold exclusively online since their launch in late 2020, but that’s changing — at least a little bit — starting tomorrow. Best Buy will stock the consoles (the PS5 disc edition, PS5 digital edition, Xbox Series X) in several of its US stores, and getting one will be similar to the process the retailer uses for selling graphics cards in person. You’ll need to show up early and form a queue, then at 7:30AM local time Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer for as many consoles as each store has in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aCLt3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1632156747229&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check Best Buy’s list of participating retailers to see if you should consider lining up early&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’re in the queue, you’ll be able to tell the folks at Best Buy which console you want to buy, and you’ll get a ticket for that specific console. Note that it’s one ticket per customer, and you’ll only be able to walk out with one console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6FCIW"&gt;Regardless of whether this kicks off more in-store opportunities to pick up a console or if it’s just one of the few chances you’ll have this year, this could be your moment to finally get one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas sued over terrible social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Former President Trump Joins TX Gov. Abbott At Unfinished Border Wall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcvxqLrVRuc_X1yKM6mLVtga5HA=/0x156:3578x2541/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894841/1326334178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wxsz2P"&gt;NetChoice and the Computer &amp;amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) have sued to stop Texas from enforcing HB 20, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661626/texas-social-media-law-hb-20-signed-greg-abbott"&gt;a new law barring large social media companies&lt;/a&gt; from banning users or removing content based on the “viewpoint” of the user. The tech industry groups’ suit comes two weeks after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill, and it follows a lawsuit that successfully &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;blocked a similar rule&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeViTa"&gt;HB 20 is one of multiple state-level efforts to make companies like Facebook and Twitter leery of moderating the accounts of conservative users. Texas lawmakers have positioned the bill as an anti-censorship provision, but NetChoice and the CCIA argue that it — like the Florida law before it — violates companies’ First Amendment rights to choose what speech they host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2FB0J"&gt;“At bottom, HB 20 imposes impermissible content- and viewpoint-based classifications to compel a select few platforms to publish speech and speakers that violate the platforms’ policies — and to present that speech the same way the platforms present other speech that does not violate their policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CCIANetChoiceTexasSocialMediaLawsuit.pdf"&gt;the complaint says&lt;/a&gt;. “At a minimum, HB 20 would unconstitutionally require platforms like YouTube and Facebook to disseminate, for example, pro-Nazi speech, terrorist propaganda, foreign government disinformation, and medical misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVLM92"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The suit says HB 20 would make sites host ‘pro-Nazi speech, terrorist propaganda, ... and medical misinformation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNwLyQ"&gt;The complaint objects to transparency provisions that would, in its words, require companies to “document in excruciating detail how they exercise their editorial discretion over potentially billions of pieces of content.” It argues that as a whole, the law infringes on web services’ right to free expression. It also calls the bill unconstitutionally vague, saying that terms like “viewpoint” could “encompass essentially all expression,” the ban on “censoring” content includes elements that could “encompass even the basic functions that Plaintiffs’ members use to present content,” and its definition of “social media platform” could cover services like the shopping site eBay or the gaming and “metaverse” platform &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QekEi"&gt;Like other states’ laws, HB 20 may also be preempted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal rule that would override conflicting state-level policies. Section 230 says that web services can’t be treated as the publisher or speaker of third-party content, and they generally can’t be prosecuted for removing “objectionable” content from their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXyETV"&gt;In a call with reporters, NetChoice president and CEO Steve DelBianco clarified that the plaintiffs aren’t immediately challenging a portion of the rule barring “censorship” on email services because they’re targeting what they see as the most immediately vulnerable sections of the law. But CCIA president Matt Schruers says they will go after that provision if necessary. “The Texas legislature is trying to legislate more spam into your inbox, and I don’t see the value of that,” says Schruers. “Nobody wants any more spam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7eNwh"&gt;A federal judge was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;highly unsympathetic&lt;/a&gt; to Florida’s social media law earlier this year, awarding NetChoice and the CCIA a preliminary injunction against it and calling it likely unconstitutional. The Texas law won’t raise all the same issues as the Florida one — for instance, it doesn’t include Florida’s infamous exception for companies with theme parks. But the two rules have a lot in common, and &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-leads-10-state-coalition-regulate-big-tech-censorship"&gt;Texas (alongside nine other states) submitted&lt;/a&gt; a brief supporting Florida in its case, saying an unfavorable ruling could potentially “imperil” similar laws like HB 20.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord starts testing YouTube integration weeks after Google shuts down music bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRhV_mehDPmQbIRM8S0SwOau7Yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894750/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9XiKy"&gt;Discord is starting to test YouTube integration, just weeks after Google-owned YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;forced two popular Discord music bots offline&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube integration has started appearing in a small number of Discord servers today as part of what appears to be a new test of a collaboration between Discord and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EhvSS"&gt;The feature is called Watch Together, and as the name implies, it allows Discord members to watch YouTube videos together. A test of a similar Discord feature &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;started 10 months ago&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing and resurfacing as Watch Together today, and we understand the company has re-prioritized this particular feature due to the recent music bot shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MayWlMVw-gKQplzfV_ifr2UAej4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869385/discordwatchtogether.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new Watch Together feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGfKJu"&gt;Watch Together is very similar to the experience of someone broadcasting their screen in Discord, and the button to launch it even appears alongside the video and screen sharing options. It’s designed specifically with YouTube in mind, allowing Discord server members to create a playlist of YouTube videos by searching or pasting in YouTube links. You can even toggle a remote button that lets other Discord server members share the ability to control playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi2Pa4"&gt;While it’s not identical to the popular Rythm and Groovy Discord music bots, you can use Watch Together to listen to music through YouTube in Discord. It’s not clear whether that music will be interrupted with ads, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6i2t9"&gt;YouTube began aggressively shutting down Discord music bots in recent weeks. The Google-owned company sent a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;legal cease and desist letter to Groovy Bot&lt;/a&gt; last month, forcing the popular service offline within days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;YouTube then turned its attention to the most popular Discord music bot&lt;/a&gt;, Rythm, and it ceased working earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxnRQH"&gt;We understand that this is only rolling out to Discord friends and family servers today, followed by a wider beta to small servers and then broader availability in the next few weeks. Discord is tentatively aiming to launch it to all users by the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIpVm5"&gt;We reached out to both Discord and Google to comment on the new YouTube integration, but Discord declined to comment. Google did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests video downloads for your desktop browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6P8Gezby4-eqIFQ2P1mRl5h1O2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894383/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lsg7EP"&gt;YouTube is testing an official way to download videos on your desktop web browser (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you want to see if you’re eligible for the test, which runs through October 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;check out YouTube’s experimental features page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists tests available for Premium subscribers. I was able to opt in to the test, but a colleague of mine wasn’t, which seems to indicate that not everyone is able to try the feature just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy3wOj"&gt;If you’re opted-in and on a supported browser (“the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera,” according to Google), when you’re watching a video, you should see an option to download the video under the player. When you click it, YouTube will download the video, which you can then watch from the Downloads section that’s accessible from the hamburger menu on the left side of the screen. I can’t find a way to download videos and watch them outside of my browser — this seems to be more of a way to watch YouTube videos offline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vY_jez-K439lpdn6Bmzyd6dgIBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870345/Screen_Shot_2021_09_22_at_11.14.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Downloads section looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nTmN2C"&gt;Be warned that the feature might be a little buggy. Shortly after I first opted in, videos didn’t download; their progress would hang at zero percent. But when I tried again a few minutes later, the feature worked as expected. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Ballmer: ‘Toilets, toilets, toilets’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LA Clippers Break Ground on Intuit Dome" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bxeM0FWsxkubxC2br7rMnYaw-n0=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894274/1235321237.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLINwu"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/23/4650596/steve-ballmer-retiring-as-microsoft-ceo"&gt;leaving Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, ex-CEO Steve Ballmer has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5995119/steve-ballmer-now-owns-the-la-clippers"&gt;devoted his life to the Los Angeles Clippers&lt;/a&gt;, transferring his enthusiastic, often scary keynote energy into pure, sport-oriented hype. But what about his passions? What’s replaced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaVTHG-Ev4k"&gt;Windows “developers, developers, developers”&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of the man who’s spending around $1.8 billion to build the new Intuit Dome arena in Inglewood? One word: toilets (&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ex-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmer-has-a-new-obsession-toilets/#ftag=RSSbaffb68"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxVG5T"&gt;“I’ve become a real obsessive about toilets,” Ballmer &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EdQNwGwi4ZI?t=2973"&gt;shared at the groundbreaking for the new arena&lt;/a&gt;. “Toilets, toilets, toilets.” To be fair to the enterprise software evangelist turned NBA chairman, it does seem like the Intuit Dome will have a lot of them — one toilet for every 27 seats in the arena’s upper deck, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/09/20/steve-ballmer-clippers-intuit-arena/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;, “an unmatched ratio in the NBA.” The ballooning costs for the complex, which includes space for the Clipper’s training facility and business offices, could reportedly cost over $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SnY6Jg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdQNwGwi4ZI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=2973&amp;amp;start=2973" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaqgb9"&gt;Ballmer’s new dome sounds like a predictably over-the-top affair. The arena will feature a gigantic, 44,000-square-foot LED scoreboard, a concession stand concept that sounds a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869294/amazon-go-store-chicago-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon’s cashier-less Go stores&lt;/a&gt;, and a collection of 51 rows of baseline seats dubbed “The Wall” that Ballmer hopes will rival Fenway Park’s Green Monster in terms of recognizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytz7XV"&gt;But really, it’s all about the toilets. “The architects keep getting on me. You’re supposed to call them ‘fixtures’ instead of toilets. But it’s the same thing,” Ballmer says. “We’re putting a whole lot more toilets than anyone else in the NBA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbjFr2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAJq4s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse suspends delivery, recalls dozens of its flagship electric vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Woh_I7VxOTMDo9NyMJ-rsebaf28=/0x67:1600x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893903/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gPFhHv"&gt;Ohio-based electric vehicle startup Workhorse is suspending deliveries of its C-1000 electric delivery vans and recalling 41 vehicles that have already been sent to customers, telling regulators the vans need “additional testing and modifications” in order to comply with federal safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VAakQ"&gt;It was the latest setback for the company, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;abandoned its effort&lt;/a&gt; to overturn the US Postal Service’s decision to let a different company build the next-generation mail truck. That contract was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;awarded to defense manufacturer Oshkosh&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Wh1gA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was the latest setback for the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kag0kD"&gt;The C-1000 is meant to be Workhorse’s flagship vehicle, with 1,000 cubic feet of cargo space. The company said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;continuing to tinker with the design&lt;/a&gt;, even as it finally got the vehicle into production this past quarter following years of struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKjgrr"&gt;But apparently that wasn’t enough to stave off a recall. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000121390021049277/ea147777ex99-1_workhorse.htm"&gt;In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Workhorse said it identified “a number of enhancements in the production process and design of the C-1000 to address customer feedback, primarily related to vehicle dynamics to increase the vehicles’ payload capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7BrKG"&gt;“We have identified a number of opportunities to improve our C-1000 series vehicles and are committed to getting these previously delivered vehicles back on the road,” Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch said in a statement. “Importantly, we remain on track to communicate our new, long-term strategic roadmap to enhance our trucks and operational capabilities on our third quarter earnings call. We continue to be confident in our ability to be a leading manufacturer of last-mile delivery vehicles over the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbVplt"&gt;The company says it intends to complete its testing of the C-1000 in the fourth quarter of this year and will provide an update to investors during the third quarter earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Surface Duo 2   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3qvLqD0eCrbRq5t9lAJvifnRec=/59x0:2189x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893844/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_1.27.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 128GB and 256GB variants of the Surface Duo 2 come in either black or white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksiUfP"&gt;As expected, Microsoft announced the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2 &lt;/a&gt;during what was an otherwise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;laptop-focused Surface event&lt;/a&gt;. The tech giant debuted the new Android phone alongside four new Surface devices, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679573/microsoft-surface-pro-x-display-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, and Surface Go 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjjVeW"&gt;Packed with some major updates, the successor to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; is faster and comes equipped with an improved camera and support for contactless payments. Pricing starts at $1,499.99, and the dual-screen, hinged device will launch on October 20th. However, you can preorder the phone — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22447824"&gt;as well as the other Surface hardware&lt;/a&gt; — from several retailers now, and check out our hands-on to see if it’s worth the purchase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-desig-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="daBbyZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft’s new Surface Duo 2 has all the features that were missing the first time around","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"},{"title":"Microsoft Surface Laptop hands-on: one weird, powerful computer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="0ABYJf"&gt;How to preorder the Surface Duo 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tsaq9h"&gt;Unlike its predecessor, the Surface Duo 2 runs on Android 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683595/microsoft-surface-duo-2-fcc-5g-nfc-wireless-charging-support-features"&gt;supports 5G&lt;/a&gt; as well as wireless charging, and features an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;NFC chip for contactless payments&lt;/a&gt;. It boasts a dynamic triple-camera system that includes a 12MP telephoto on the front, allowing for higher-res video calls, as well as a 16MP ultrawide lens on the rear. Similar to its Android-equipped rivals — specifically, this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; — the Duo 2 additionally uses Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor, as well as 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZ8wYj"&gt;Display-wise, the two 5.8-inch, 1344 x 1892 OLED touchscreens open to 8.3 inches diagonally and offer the ability to run two select apps side by side. You can also drag and drop between screens in select apps. When it comes to the overall design, the device features thinner bezels and sells in both “glacier” and “obsidian” color variants. Note, however, Microsoft isn’t selling a 512GB configuration in the obsidian tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdjHzW"&gt;The Surface Duo 2 is currently available for preorder at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeSurfaceDuo2092221&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-duo-2%2F9408kgxp4xjl%3Frtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and Best Buy (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDz6oNj20K#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDAnRdtDc1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt;). Unlocked, you can buy the base 128GB model for $1,499.99, while the 256GB and 512GB versions retail for $1,599.99 and $1,799.99, respectively. Note, however, that the 512GB configuration is currently unavailable at both retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Fortnite back on iOS until the Epic v. Apple verdict is final</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcsPFKxn9iPAteYcqQizaLx-4F8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893640/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVZADu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will not be returning to the iOS App Store anytime soon, according to a series of emails &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711467888615431"&gt;published on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmQeCW"&gt;Epic’s iOS developer account had been suspended as a result of the company’s intentional violations of the App Store guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which set the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;the companies’ court battle&lt;/a&gt;. But in the wake of the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the state of Epic’s iOS apps — particularly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XfAoi4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple lied,” says Epic CEO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui7pQh"&gt;The emails published on Wednesday, both on Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-lied-breaks-its-promise-to-allow-fortnite-back-on-ios-under-its-rules"&gt;and an Epic blog post&lt;/a&gt;, indicate Epic Games’ various apps are unlikely to return to the App Store for the foreseeable future. One letter published by Sweeney — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690"&gt;dated September 21st&lt;/a&gt; and sent by lawyers representing Apple — informs the company that Apple will not reinstate Epic’s developer account until the appeals have been resolved, a process that could take years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxmgQT"&gt;“Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic’s developer program account at this time,” the email reads. “Furthermore, Apple will not consider any further requests for reinstatement until the district court’s judgment becomes final and non-appealable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z88lak"&gt;The message accurately notes that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, concluded Apple is within its rights to terminate any Epic-related accounts it desires from the App Store. Epic has already paid financial damages for breaching its contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oEzEXJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without a working developer account, Epic can’t re-release Fortnite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fGLng"&gt;The appeals path for &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is still in flux. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has announced its intention to appeal&lt;/a&gt; the portions of the ruling it lost, although the higher court has not yet agreed to hear the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;Apple has stated&lt;/a&gt; that it’s still considering its options for legal appeal. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679724/tim-cook-epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-employee-meeting"&gt;told employees after the ruling&lt;/a&gt; that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBPok"&gt;Writing on Twitter, Sweeney framed Apple’s refusal as a betrayal of its earlier pledge to reinstate Epic Games once the company assented to follow the App Store guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PghslO"&gt;“Apple lied,” Sweeney wrote. “Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d ‘welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else.’ Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUrBBg"&gt;Apple declined to comment on Sweeney’s tweets, but did not dispute the authenticity of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOXhPu"&gt;The decision appears to scuttle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;Epic’s attempt to return&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to the iOS App Store in South Korea, which recently passed rules requiring alternate payment method support. It also leaves &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; future elsewhere in question. Epic had recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imgoldenyt/status/1437493375297589248"&gt;updated old copies of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on iOS remotely to remove V-Bucks purchasing options, theoretically putting it back in compliance with Apple’s rules. But without a working developer account, Epic can’t re-release the game in any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1A1xf"&gt;Still, the decision to publish the emails publicly shows that Sweeney is eager to keep pressure on Apple, even if it means keeping &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off of iPhones. “We’ll fight on,” said Sweeney on Twitter. “The need for regulatory and legislative action is clearer than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXcevG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Late last night, Apple informed Epic that Fortnite will be blacklisted from the Apple ecosystem until the exhaustion of all court appeals, which could be as long as a 5-year process. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QCD7wogJef"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QCD7wogJef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lX8aEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9/22 1:29PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include that Apple declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s fall Surface event: the 7 biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fi9Qwi-JES6nII47AcDd0pjjJNw=/120x0:1412x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893536/lcimg_076b6165_5803_444c_96b1_967afc745e75.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Panos Panay at Wednesday’s Surface event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9CTCAI"&gt;Microsoft just wrapped up its latest Surface event, and it was packed with news — including the redesigned Surface Pro 8, a camera-equipped Surface Duo 2, and even a new flagship laptop that puts a hinge behind the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxjsAx"&gt;If you weren’t able to watch the show live, catch up with all of the biggest announcements from the event right here. And if you’re interested in buying any of the products, they’re all available for preorder Wednesday ahead of release on October 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-6aUu9gwbQmE72BbM-76y0n205Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869859/lcimg_8d56f7ef_0bde_4b8d_9564_7db371b94001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8, which has a new design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chyrs0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22449964"&gt;The Surface Pro 8 redesigns the Surface Pro line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rDgn5o"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 brings a big redesign to the popular Surface Pro line, with thinner bezels, a larger 13-inch touchscreen, two Thunderbolt 4 ports (meaning no more USB-A port), and more. It also supports the new Surface Slim Pen 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzkNwhCE3mZCkhewuTxFovEJpjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869860/lcimg_524ba5a4_792e_452e_b3b6_49d0f924ef78.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RYcddh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22450051"&gt;The Surface Laptop Studio puts a hinge behind the screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIcUn"&gt;Microsoft’s newest flagship laptop is the Surface Laptop Studio, a powerful notebook that puts a hinge behind the middle of the screen so you can bring the screen forward to more easily touch or draw on it.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Ye_iUbIKUpwVRM7uP8XvmMWeqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869863/lcimg_4936c261_5bea_4519_88a5_90afbda8ee85.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="lyYMe3"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 adds many highly requested changes from the original, including support for 5G networks and a triple-lens camera system. There’s also a new Glance Bar that shows you things like the time and how much battery is left when the device is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F_jo7fUFhUtUPLOd9CYlTA0qXsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869866/lcimg_3008b74a_f90d_45e9_b926_90f40439ccbd.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="rfUfys"&gt;Microsoft announced a new stylus, the Surface Slim Pen 2, and it has built-in haptics designed to give you more tactile feedback while you’re using it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="HPUtQN"&gt;The Surface Go 3, Microsoft’s low-end Surface, is getting updated with new Intel processors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Mmu1lj"&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Adaptive Kit includes labels and port indicators you can apply to make your Surface easier to use, as well as opener tools to help you open the lid of a Surface device or pop out its kickstand. &lt;/p&gt;
