    <title>Small launch startup Astra to go public at $2.1 billion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYUf86"&gt;Astra plans to become the first small rocket maker to go public, the company announced Tuesday, after reaching space for the first time in December. It’ll become the second publicly traded space venture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;after Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8YUWR"&gt;The Northern California-based rocket firm’s “3.2” launch vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178110/astra-small-satellite-launcher-rocket-3-2-alaska-success-orbit"&gt;blasted to space for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in December from its Kodiak, Alaska launch site, a key test mission that “far exceeded our team’s expectations,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp told reporters at the time. The launch demo, though just barely missing orbit, propelled Astra into a small group of firms that have reached space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpB8k5"&gt;The company has 50 customer launches lined up, and over $150 million of contracted launch revenue so far. Now, Astra is merging with special purpose acquisition company (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;) Holicity Inc. to take its launch business public in a deal that would value Astra at $2.1 billion. Astra’s ticker will be ASTR when the deal closes in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQDM"&gt;Kemp, NASA’s former chief technology officer, said the merger and public filing unlocks a new stage for the company: “over the next 2-3 years, we will dramatically increase our launch schedule with a goal of daily launches by 2025,” he tweeted Tuesday. It also marks “a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnY1H8"&gt;The SPAC merger teams Kemp’s Astra up with billionaire Holicity CEO Craig McCaw, who’s expected to join the company’s board of directors. It also allows Astra to tap into $500 million in cash after the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One day, your home could be made with mushrooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msHNwwtYUC8qxe3b9hFrsCVSwV0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756421/Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1g3P1"&gt;Mushrooms are helping architects and engineers solve one the world’s biggest crises: climate change. These fungi are durable, biodegradable, and are proving to be a good alternative to more polluting materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vCb1I"&gt;“Our built environment needs these kinds of materials,” says David Benjamin, founding principal architect at the firm The Living. “Different countries have really ambitious climate change goals, and this material could really help jump-start some of that progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KShs5G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”Our built environment needs these kinds of materials.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6joEzO"&gt;Building materials and construction make up about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178481/buildings-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-united-nations-report"&gt;tenth&lt;/a&gt; of global carbon dioxide emissions. That’s way more than the global &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-environment-imo/shippings-share-of-global-carbon-emissions-increases-idUSKCN2502AY"&gt;shipping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/climate-change/"&gt;aviation&lt;/a&gt; industries combined. And the problem is getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9dn7c"&gt;Materials made with mycelium, the fungal network from which mushrooms grow, might be able to help turn that around. They produce far less planet-heating carbon dioxide than traditional materials like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt;. An added bonus is that mushrooms are biodegradable, so they leave behind less harmful waste than traditional building materials. Mushrooms can even help with clean-up efforts, feeding off things that might have otherwise ended up in a landfill, like sawdust or agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKfnnI"&gt;Construction materials made from mushrooms are still in pretty early stages of research and development. But they’re showing potential as an insulation material and even as a replacement for concrete blocks. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with some of the people leading the mushroom revolution. We even made our own mushroom brick and put it to the test. Check out the video above to see how well mushrooms performed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pink Cloud is an eerily prescient sci-fi movie about being stuck in quarantine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmKFgF_dc7TaS5SfyuG1vPM04jE=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756408/50611073667_dee4285ed3_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pink Cloud. | Photo: Sundance Institute.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qhBZRj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most recent events, the 2021 edition of the Sundance Film Festival has shifted from an in-person showcase to a virtual one. Despite the change, we’ll still be bringing you reviews on the most interesting experiences we find, from indie films to VR experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApHo1Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;starts with a message that underlines the distressing ludicrousness of where we are: it’s a movie about people stuck in a never-ending quarantine because of a deadly threat outside their doors. It’s also an early prescient one, as it was written in 2017 and filmed in 2019. It has no purposeful connections to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s impossible not to draw parallels between &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;and our current reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hI82Fn"&gt;The movie is set in a Brazilian city where a mysterious pink gaseous cloud hovers over residents and kills people if they’re outside for longer than 10 seconds, trapping them in whatever building they’ve found shelter in for years at a time. That said, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is less about the deadliness of their situation and more about the devastating monotony that follows. Quarantine is seen through a relationship between Giovana (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1056455/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"&gt;Renata de Lélis&lt;/a&gt;) and Yago (Eduardo Mendonça), a one-night stand that turns into something much longer-term when they’re forced to move in together. Over the course of the next several years, Giovana and Yago navigate becoming a couple, having a child, separating without leaving the apartment, virtually dating, and getting back together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAByW"&gt;It’s the quiet moments that are &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s most powerful. FaceTime calls become tedious, eating the same thing day in and day out becomes a drag, and the only other person in people’s lives starts to grate on every nerve. We aren’t meant to suddenly stop physical contact with the rest of the world, and the cataclysmic effects of being cut off from everyone and anyone is quietly destructive. Life seems to suddenly speed up and slow down all at once. Giovana goes from being staunchly against children to having one, waiting for the lethal cloud to go away while settling into domestic routines because there’s no other way to live. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zn1quYLLOLDkyzD2K-cAwDRiWBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22274504/50611074117_bbbb01be10_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Sundance Institute&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9TeUzI"&gt;At the center of it is the internal battle between the never-ending hope things will get better and the sinking realization there’s no end in sight. People switch careers to find something they can do at home, learn new skills, watch way too much TV, play too many games, find virtual boyfriends and girlfriends, and go to school at home. Children are born into the void knowing nothing about the outside world other than what they can see from their windows. Adults who remember life pre-cloud dream of getting back to the world they once knew while working to make their new living conditions the best they can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpcjYR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is supposed to be a science fiction story, a dystopian world that quietly asks, “How would you cope in this situation?” Watching the movie in 2021, the answer is obvious: I don’t have to wonder how I’d cope, I know exactly how I’ve dealt with not being able to see family members or certain friends for nearly a year. But even with the “fiction” aspect of &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s science fiction setting removed, the movie still hit home the hardest part of Giovana and Yago’s ordeal, one that I’m still struggling with and I’m sure millions of other people are, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SEJGY"&gt;When does it all end? How much optimism can someone have that eventually the pandemic — the pink cloud — will just disappear and life will return to normal? What does return to normal even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? At a time when I’ve turned to movies to try to escape or find answers to problems that I have no control over, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is a reminder of our daily life these past 300 or so days, and it provides no immediate answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="573Da5"&gt;Turns out, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;was exactly the movie that I needed. I devoured watching this couple struggle with the same internal battle of hope and acceptance, desires and settling, fond memories of the before time and preparation for what comes next. &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, a movie written some 1,100 days before the pandemic, ironically became a way for me to process so much of what happened in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech made so much money during the pandemic it could afford this Super Bowl ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j0ahpX5ownS9XFSHDqbjn_9SNc0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756342/DefyLogic_Nas.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSyoBY"&gt;Logitech sold enough keyboards, mice, and PC webcams during the pandemic that it can afford its first-ever Super Bowl commercial. The 60-second spot, titled “Defy Logic,” will air during the first quarter of the game on February 7th and feature rapper and songwriter Lil Nas X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srXqLv"&gt;The documentary-style ad spotlights how artists and other creative types use Logitech products for their work. It shows Lil Nas X writing and recording a song, along with graphic and visual artists; streamers; musicians; and climate, gender equality, and education reform activists demonstrating their Logitech items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Tz55x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChIDLM"&gt;In May, Logitech reported &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-logitech-results/logitech-sales-surge-as-working-from-home-boosts-demand-idUSKBN22O06A?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews"&gt;sales of its products&lt;/a&gt; were booming as the pandemic kept millions of people working and schooling from home. Sales of its video collaboration products — which include cameras, microphones, and software used in online meetings — increased by 60 percent year over year, with accessories like tablets and webcams seeing double-digit growth. The company reported sales were up 13.6 percent in the three months ending March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZyBBm"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Logitech-F3Q21-Prepared-Remarks.pdf"&gt;Logitech reported its third-quarter sales&lt;/a&gt; were up 85 percent year over year to $1.67 billion, with sales of PC webcams more than quadrupling to $132 million, and sales of its video collaboration products more than tripling to a record $293 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbTbkx"&gt;Logitech didn’t say how much it paid for the Super Bowl commercial, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/cbs-has-sold-virtually-all-of-its-commercial-time-for-the-super-bowl.html"&gt;30-second spots are going for a reported $5.5 million&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it plans to air a 30-second version of its Defy Logic ad during the Grammy Awards in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7VRHc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goro Miyazaki on what makes a Studio Ghibli film: ‘I wish somebody could give me an answer’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation director Goro Miyazaki, son of famous Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, is photographed i" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QjyQvnWPgxeit0O5ocVJpJN994=/0x1:2933x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756300/566022025.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The famed animation studio returns with its first 3D CG movie, Earwig and the Witch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="H5ucNc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t look like a Studio Ghibli film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISTuDQ"&gt;It’s the famed studio’s first foray into CG animation, and it’s a big departure from lush, hand-drawn films like &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also Ghibli’s first animated film since 2014’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8643009/when-marnie-was-there-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Marnie Was There&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkkPWX"&gt;That’s a big task to take on, and leading the charge is director Goro Miyazaki, son of studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki. After reluctantly following his father into animation — Goro originally spent years working as a landscape designer — this is his third film, following &lt;em&gt;Tales from Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;, a controversial adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin’s classic novels, and the charming period piece &lt;em&gt;From Up on Poppy Hill&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCl1OY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earwig &lt;/em&gt;is based on the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, and it follows a precocious young girl who has been adopted by a witch who quickly puts her to work. It may not have the visual style of a classic Ghibli film, but it touches on many of the elements of whimsy and fantasy that have made the studio’s works so beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eMMlSO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s very challenging, is all I can say.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8PVCF"&gt;Miyazaki says that production of the film wrapped up last year, just before the Japanese government called for a state of emergency, so it wasn’t impacted much. “We were very fortunate in that way with this film,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That said, he’s no stranger to troubled productions: during the creation of &lt;em&gt;Poppy Hill&lt;/em&gt;, Japan was struck by a massive earthquake, and the team had to work around rolling blackouts. “There was still hope and positivity,” he says of that time. “But now with the current situation, there’s so much uncertainty. It’s very challenging, is all I can say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuEgyg"&gt;The new film debuted on television in Japan in December, and it’ll be out on HBO Max in the US on February 5th. (It’ll also be playing in select theaters starting February 3rd.) Ahead of &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt;’s English debut, I had the chance to talk to Miyazaki about his career so far, the shift to CG, and the existential question of what a Studio Ghibli film actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRZxjR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCJW4s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All three of your films are very different in terms of story and style. How do you decide what projects to work on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUSDl"&gt;It mostly comes out of my conversations with our producer, Toshio Suzuki, rather than the decision being solely mine. Through the conversations I have with him, he will maybe suggest something: “Do you want to do an adaptation of this story or that story?” And then if I feel like it’s something that I can do, then it becomes a project that I take on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82Prtb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in particular that spoke to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyYiKi"&gt;One of the things that I loved about the story was the protagonist Earwig not being your typical well-behaved girl. When it’s necessary, she can be manipulative of people around her, and when somebody treats her bad, she thinks of how she can get back at them. It’s not your typical heroine from a lot of Japanese animation where they’re very honest, pure, and beautiful. Earwig is very different from that. When she faces a difficult situation, she is not someone who would just persevere and wait until somebody saves her. She’s the one that actually acts and tries to change the situation herself. So that I found was very interesting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="v5PyvB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lk5YWIbwzRE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tXmwQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the visual style come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGVRH0"&gt;In terms of the visuals, this being the first 3D CG anime from Studio Ghibli… Studio Ghibli has always done hand-drawn-style animation, so we knew that we weren’t able to recreate that through 3D CG, so it was a matter of which direction we wanted to go with. Whether it’s going to be a very photorealistic visual, or trying to find a different path. That was when I referenced stop-motion animation, using a lot of puppets. I felt that was quite fitting for what we were trying to do with this project. I referenced that a lot in creating the visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIbKY8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read that because so few people at Ghibli understood 3D animation, you were given pretty free rein on this project. Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kuYts"&gt;It is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwyp3M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does CG offer compared to hand-drawn animation in terms of what you can do and how you can express yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBOoGJ"&gt;One of the things I found was that with hand-drawn animation, you have to rely on the hands of a very talented animator to bring out a great performance from the character with facial expressions, emotions, and so forth. There’s a limited number of very talented animators that can do so. That’s one of the big challenges with hand-drawn animation. But with 3D CG, you’re able to have different people working on different expressions of one character, which worked well for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIo9FC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that struck me about the movie was so much of it took place in a single location. Was this a conscious decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLklb"&gt;The original story is about the girl being confined in that house, and dealing with the witch she lives with. However, what we did was, because there are limited locations, we wanted to make sure that each set was high quality, that it was very rich in details. If you think about trying to recreate that with hand-drawn animation, the art department would go crazy because it would mean they would have to redraw all of that clutter and small details a million times. In that sense, the 3D CG approach really worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yRaPfi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was like me hiding in the garage without people noticing what I was doing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZKJ4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since this is Ghibli’s first CG film, and also the first new film from the studio in years, did you feel any extra pressure compared to your previous projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXjXA"&gt;Not really, not much pressure. Because by the time I started working on this film, &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt;, Hayao Miyazaki had already started working on his new film [&lt;em&gt;How Do You Live?&lt;/em&gt;]. So I was able to kind of hide behind that and not feel much pressure from the outside. It was like me hiding in the garage without people noticing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKdT2N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you take out the hand-drawn aspect, what do you think are the elements that make a film a Ghibli film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXphnH"&gt;That question is kind of a puzzle. What makes a film a Ghibli film? People who have seen &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt; will tell me “It’s actually more Ghibli than I expected.” And I wonder why they say that. I wish somebody could give me an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrB0cD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is it like a feeling? You know it when you see it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COdhHA"&gt;Probably so. Someone told me that maybe it’s just something in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXK7aB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that you’ve directed three films, how do you think you’ve grown or changed as a director?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="URwvgY"&gt;With each project, I feel like I’m doing something for the first time, so it’s hard to tell whether I’m growing or not. After working on this film, I feel that I like things that are lighter, with humor, and not too serious. And with humor, I really like the dry humor that you can see in Diana Wynne Jones’ story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheaters are ruining Call of Duty: Warzone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cKaS7fIVGRauEkw_iNTqn5KszA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756227/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GyziK"&gt;Cheaters in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; are ruining the game and forcing professional players to abandon it. Game hacks and cheat software are being widely used in the battle royale hit, and it has left the community of millions of players feeling frustrated with the lack of attention from publisher Activision and developer Infinity Ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCnEOA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating in some of the world’s top PC games has been getting worse&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, and aimbots and wallhacks are now increasingly common in the industry’s most competitive shooters. Aimbots automatically lock onto opponents’ heads, making it easy to wipe out waves of players. Wallhacks expose everyone on a map, so cheaters get a huge advantage by knowing where their opponents are at all times. In battle royale games, which ask players to spend sometimes between 20 to 30 minutes playing a single match, losing to a cheater can be especially frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4wDPrO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OnzwLQ"&gt;Cheating has reached a breaking point for some who primarily play &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. YouTuber Vikkstar123 &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T7Lhin677Qs"&gt;quit the game last week&lt;/a&gt;, after a cheater was blatantly using wallhacks and aimbots and streaming to Facebook Gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvNvoY"&gt;The cheater was even part of Facebook’s Level Up program, so they were able to freely stream game cheats and actually make money doing so. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1356390971982934016"&gt;Facebook has now demonetized the cheater&lt;/a&gt;. But since the company did not ban them, the streamer continued with blatant wallhacks enabled just hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHEv3YAz97XlPvvpf_bIlzl1GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275394/W7mBmk0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheater streaming live on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MkZ875"&gt;Vikkstar isn’t alone in his frustrations. A $250,000 &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; tournament was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-22-usd250-000-call-of-duty-warzone-tournament-rocked-by-accusations-of-cheating"&gt;rocked by accusations of cheating last month&lt;/a&gt;, when rival high-profile players accused a Canadian player of using an aimbot, which the player denied. It led to a situation where a member of the esports organization 100 Thieves searched through the computer of the accused player live on Twitch, in an attempt to find cheating software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWop3K"&gt;Prominent &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS/status/1352430270293692416"&gt;Nickmercs&lt;/a&gt; and YouTuber &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Drift0r/status/1352448721284427776"&gt;Drift0r&lt;/a&gt; have also both been highly vocal about the rise of cheating in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. This latest round of outcries follows months of issues with hacking in the game, where players have regularly spotted people using aimbots and wallhacks and sharing clips on Reddit and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUsLHM"&gt;The response from Activision and Infinity Ward has lacked urgency. Activision made it clear it has “zero tolerance” for cheaters in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.activision.com/uk/en/call-of-duty/2020-03/Cheaters-Not-Welcomed-in-Call-of-Duty-Warzone"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, when it moved to ban thousands of players. By October, Infinity Ward revealed it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1311471137663021056"&gt;banned more than 200,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; for cheating across &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a vague promise of “additional security updates and added backend enforcement tools,” but many players feel there isn’t enough being done to combat the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eUXZje"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-02-02T12:22:40.794277+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/l6ul47/i_spectated_a_cheater_in_warzone_who_sucks_at/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;I Spectated a Cheater in Warzone Who Sucks at Cheating, I Thoroughly Enjoyed Watching Them Fail at the End!&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/"&gt;CODWarzone&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azBUh8"&gt;Cheating isn’t a problem that’s unique to &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. Popular games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;many other titles have been experiencing high levels of cheating recently&lt;/a&gt;. People are even cheating in games like &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, where aimbots aren’t exactly necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edxjbh"&gt;It might seem like this cheating surge is limited to PC gaming, but it also extends to game consoles. Cheaters can purchase specially modded controllers to get an edge in games, improving aim assist, gun recoil, and more. CronusMAX is popular across both PlayStation and Xbox, and it allows players to run millions of scripts, mods, exploits, and macros to automate and improve gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQvYdU"&gt;The biggest problem the industry faces is tackling this collectively. There are a variety of anti-cheat solutions being used by various game developers, but it’s a cat-and-mouse game against the hackers developing the cheats. It’s very much like the malware industry, and game developers have to be on top of detecting new cheats with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E39ClO"&gt;Game developers are often too slow to respond to blatant cheating, or don’t do enough to communicate with the communities frustrated most by the cheating issues. With hackers able to generate huge sums from selling cheats, it increasingly looks like a problem that will get worse before it gets any better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft planning special gaming, cloud, and Windows events in coming months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tG5HNL7FlbhXDYCQCV-xAm_c78=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756212/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CArypR"&gt;Microsoft is planning a series of news events over the coming months that will focus on categories like gaming, cloud, and Windows. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned that Microsoft is dedicating time to particular categories at a time when the pandemic has halted in-person events. Microsoft’s first event will take place later this week, focusing on what’s next for work and Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMidl0"&gt;The company is planning similar events that focus on what’s next for its cloud ambitions, as well as gaming, Windows, and security in the coming months. Microsoft typically discusses a broad range of its products at events like Ignite or Build, and this will continue, but these separate events are designed to highlight what its product changes mean for entire categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sx8BA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SatyaNadella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jared_spataro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Jared_Spataro&lt;/a&gt; discuss ways to transform the employee experience. Save the date for our digital event. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmployeeExperience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EmployeeExperience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LV5KjcwBPF"&gt;https://t.co/LV5KjcwBPF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uHHbQlFdcX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uHHbQlFdcX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 (@Microsoft365) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft365/status/1354836654050193409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pK0awF"&gt;The Windows event will likely focus on Microsoft’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;” of the operating system, which is currently codenamed “Sun Valley,” and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is putting a larger effort into overhauling the UI of Windows this year, with visual changes planned to improve the consistency of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcyRrt"&gt;Microsoft also has big plans for gaming in general throughout 2021, especially with its Xbox Game Pass and xCloud work. Microsoft’s dedicated gaming event will likely focus on the company’s plans to expand xCloud and its gaming efforts, in a year that will see a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/5/21208583/e3-2021-june-coronavirus"&gt;“reimagined” E3 take place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30Ufv1"&gt;This entire approach to news events from Microsoft is different from previous years. It’s taking place during a year where many people continue to work and even study remotely. The pandemic has reshaped entire industries, and it will likely fuel many of Microsoft’s announcements across 2021. If the events are a success, it could even shape how Microsoft plans its news announcements for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite gaming gear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q151Nxt-ZtQme8k6Bo9tJEsXauQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756076/acastro_210128_4393_favoriteGamingGear_0001.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Art: Alex Castro / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31aGqn"&gt;Gaming was already popular when the pandemic hit in early 2020; with a large number of people stuck at home, it has become close to a national obsession. So once you have your console or computer, and your game (or games), what more do you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hwAr5"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, many of whom are avid gamers, to talk about their favorite gaming gear. Below, we describe game controllers, mice, headsets, and other useful peripherals that can take your gaming experience up that extra notch (or even several notches). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtYStr"&gt;Have a great time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vp3y6a"&gt;Nintendo Switch Pro Controller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch Pro Controller&amp;amp;nbsp;" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65ZERiHSplbqlGxBF3ZlsSbey5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253350/7166__AaJIL._SL1500_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch Pro Controller  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKuLZC"&gt;If you have a non-Lite Nintendo Switch, the Pro Controller is a necessary accessory, in my opinion. Although the regular Switch comes with two Joy-Con controllers, they’re small and not particularly ergonomic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PDoDE"&gt;The Pro Controller, on the other hand, feels great to hold and has held up for me over hours of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, &lt;/em&gt;and many other games. It’s not cheap, but it’s worth every penny. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZWVcF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297960" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1DCVc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y6b3or"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero gaming mouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Hero " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QaFzX42IBH4cQs7_bqCzu-cqAWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261577/hero.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech G502 Hero &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jprll9"&gt;What can I say about the Logitech G502 line that has not already been said? My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, thinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;it’s the best and most affordable wired take on the best gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now — and rightfully so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuuk3F"&gt;I play a ton of first-person shooters on my gaming PC, so when I was in the market for a new gaming mouse (I previously used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18168210/corsair-gaming-mouse-50m-clicks-omron-switch-m65-rgb-elite-ironclaw-ces-2019"&gt;Corsair’s M65 RGB Elite&lt;/a&gt;), I wanted something that had a good amount of programmable buttons — including one on the mouse’s left-hand side — as easy shortcuts for when I needed to aim my weapons quickly. Now, each macro is assigned to a conveniently placed button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seNQk1"&gt;I have used a good number of gaming mice before switching to the G502 Hero, and I honestly do not think any other gaming mouse will replace it. I might buy the wireless version at some point to minimize cable management, but at $50, the G502 Hero is a great gaming mouse for people who prefer wired gaming mice or who don’t have a ton of money to splurge on its wireless counterpart. &lt;em&gt;— Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJ5dLr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0lDBld"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pdUmcj"&gt;Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kO-l63-uXPjtpLTlYl9VxtB8xhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253622/xbox_360_wireless_receiver.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ePHT3"&gt;Fifteen years ago, Microsoft released the best dongle ever made, one that I still use every single week. It’s an unconscionably long, six-foot USB cable with a little pod on the end that, uh, always reminds me of &lt;a href="http://bobcanada92.blogspot.com/2012/04/alien-porn.html"&gt;a Centauri tentacle&lt;/a&gt;. But this dongle is worth a little cringe: it lets me reliably connect four Xbox 360 wireless controllers to a Windows PC to play a wide array of games from across the room, and thanks to continued plug-and-play Windows functionality and robust Steam support, every game designed for controllers works perfectly with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efufhu"&gt;It’s an amazingly stable, inexpensive way to get four-player couch games (like &lt;em&gt;Duck Game&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; SpeedRunners&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; TowerFall&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Overcooked!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Spelunky&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Lance A Lot&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) up and running quickly, particularly since Xbox 360 wireless controllers are cheap and easy to obtain. I wish I could say the same for the adapter itself; some of the third-party knockoffs have compatibility issues, and tracking down the original might mean a visit to eBay. That’s how I bought one for a buddy this past holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsLdzG"&gt;If you do find an official one that doesn’t light up, don’t throw it out! If you’re handy with a soldering iron, it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FMicrosoft%2BXbox%2B360%2BWireless%2BGaming%2BReceiver%2Bfuse%2Breplacement%2F118338&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22244488%2Fgaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pretty easy to replace (or even short)&lt;/a&gt; the burnt-out fuse. &lt;em&gt;— Sean Hollister, senior news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzsMa8"&gt;If you’re willing to pay a premium, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better wireless gaming headset than the Arctis Pro Wireless. In 2018, I pitted it against &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1YZ4lqpnYIHhoy8IXDHhJMZRXGXcYujI5O1yYFHZcQsE/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;amp;ouid=117898641365769640880"&gt;every single one of its competitors&lt;/a&gt; and it got top marks for sound quality, mic quality, wireless range, battery life, and an array of unusually handy features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZgsmo"&gt;If I’m gaming with buddies and want a snack, I don’t need to stop chatting — I just walk several rooms away to the kitchen and the audio never cuts out. When a too-loud game drowns out my friends, I tap the dial beneath the ear cup to rebalance the audio between “game” and “chat” — it gives you two different audio devices in Windows. When the battery runs out, I can just pop a spare battery pack out of the base station and swap it in under 15 seconds. I make a lot of calls with the Arctis Pro Wireless, too, thanks to its built-in Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKeD60"&gt;Just know it’s a little pinch-y on big heads, despite having the fabric band suspension design that makes a lot of SteelSeries’ other headsets comfortable. And be careful not to try to bend it wider using the ear cups; quite a few buyers have found the joints can snap if you apply too much force. &lt;em&gt;— Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BVq5nf"&gt;I love my Oculus Quest 2, but I’m not exaggerating when I say I find it almost unusable out of the box. The flimsy stock strap barely fits my head and makes the headset feel incredibly front-heavy, while the foam face pad gets hot and uncomfortable quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhjt0V"&gt;Fortunately, there are good solutions to both problems. Oculus sells an official Elite Strap for the Quest 2 for $49, which suggests the company itself knows the stock option isn’t great, and indeed it’s a huge improvement. It’s much sturdier, with a plastic back plate that better distributes weight and tightens around your head with an easily adjustable dial. There were reported issues with some early units cracking, but I haven’t had a problem with mine, and Oculus has addressed the issue with replacements and extended warranties, so I definitely recommend it. &lt;em&gt; — Sam Byford, Asia editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC3cGq"&gt;The next way to upgrade your Quest 2 experience is with a simple piece of rubber. Various companies sell alternative face pad covers, and the one I’ve been using is the Quest 2 silicone option from VR Cover. I used swappable cloth versions from VR Cover with the original Quest, which was still an improvement over the stock foam, but I like the hypoallergenic silicone even better. It attaches to the Quest 2 easily and is much more comfortable to have pressed against your face for hours than clammy foam; plus, you can rinse it down easily after a hardcore &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; session. I don’t know why something like this doesn’t come in the box, but it’s absolutely worth the $14. &lt;em&gt;— Sam Byford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="skT7xJ"&gt;This is a great accessory for anyone who wants to play emulated Wii games on their PC. It’s like the one that the Nintendo Wii console used to have, but offers Bluetooth to connect your Wii Remotes as well. I bought one of these for my own PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games — and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rIc0nE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;You’ve heard all the hype&lt;/a&gt; about the DualSense’s vibration motors and adaptive triggers. And to be sure, those things are awesome for the games that use them, but they aren’t what make the DualSense my favorite controller of those I’ve ever used. It’s that it has &lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;a modern controller needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKcOhJ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361885/sony-ps4-dualshock-4-colors-return-on-sale-august-berry-blue-red-ramouflage"&gt;DualShock 4&lt;/a&gt; had a headphone jack, but also the terrible micro-USB. The Switch Pro Controller has USB-C, but it’s a bit small for my tastes and doesn’t have a headphone jack. The DualSense has both USB-C and a headphone jack, and that’s just such a quality-of-life improvement. When I need to charge it, I grab my laptop charger, and when I want to keep the noise to myself, I grab my headphones. There’s no friction between me and playing whatever game I want to play. &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8hn4F"&gt;It can be a real hassle to find the right gaming headset — one that’s both comfortable and compatible with most (or ideally, all) of your consoles. Few wireless solutions can do it all, but I really love using Creative’s BT-W3 USB-C Bluetooth receiver. It can pair to Bluetooth headphones you already own, making it a crafty and budget-minded purchase at around $40. It works seamlessly with PS5 and Nintendo Switch, and its USB-C-to-A adapter allows it to work perfectly on PC. Better yet, this dongle can toggle between low-latency and high-quality codecs with a push of a button, and it ships with a 3.5mm microphone that you can plug into your controller to chat with friends. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FiVKfZ"&gt;I like to have the best audio possible, especially playing multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;. Because gaming headset mics will only do so much, I wanted a separate mic for audio output. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus"&gt;Like I’ve mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, that’s why I chose the QuadCast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seFRLc"&gt;At $140, it gives me great clarity when speaking, easy-to-use controls, and a shock mount adapter for boom arms. I also enjoy that the mute button is on top of the microphone. It might be unconventional, yet it’s conveniently placed if you’re using a boom arm, and it makes it easy to mute myself. It also comes with a three-meter cable; I find it annoying that some companies like Blue give you a too-short cable with their pricey USB mics. — &lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PqnKbn"&gt;Here’s a slightly unconventional entry that has significantly improved my quality of life, so I want to share it with everyone here: a full-motion TV mount. Recently, I moved to a new, much smaller apartment. I had to find ways to maximize my space and, all joking aside, fit my rather large PS5 someplace. This is where the Echogear mount comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxv9sQ"&gt;The model that I got is incredibly well built and strong enough to hold TVs up to 125lbs or 86 inches diagonally. With my 55-inch LG CX, it’s smooth to operate, and I can move it around as needed to find the perfect angle — which I do, because another downside of my new place is that the windows are right across from the TV. I never thought I’d get so much use out of a TV wall mount. Plus, TVs look super nice mounted on the wall and it’s a fun little home improvement project. Just don’t try to do it all by yourself. — &lt;em&gt;Vjeran Pavic, senior video director&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSwV6h"&gt;I’m not a huge fan of flight simulators and couldn’t justify spending hundreds of dollars on a full &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=HOTAS"&gt;HOTAS&lt;/a&gt; kit. But when I heard &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; was coming out on PC, I couldn’t limit myself to playing on a keyboard or gamepad. I love &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to ensure that I could recreate the experience of flying an X-Wing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjMjOU"&gt;I found the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick on sale, and it’s truly one of the best gaming peripheral purchases I’ve made. It features 12 programmable buttons, an eight-way hat switch, and a nice hand grip for people who use their right hand while playing games. If you’re like me and only need it for a few titles, you can’t go wrong with this flight stick. — &lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ Spot adds self-charging to live at remote sites forever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dlJ92bV2exgBjx0Y72ePnykBDNQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756019/Arm_Industrial_Drag_Hose_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boston Dynamics will sell an arm to allow the robot to interact with objects in its environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s also new browser based controls and a robotic arm attachment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1V8YzS"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ robotic dog, Spot, is getting a lot more self-sufficient. Today the company is announcing Spot Enterprise, a new version of the robot that features a charging stand to top-up its batteries without any human interaction. The robotics company is also announcing Scout, a new browser-based control system that offers a streamlined interface for piloting Spot over the internet, as well as a new robotic arm to help the robot “grasp, lift, carry, place, and drag a wide variety of objects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U97MgU"&gt;The new features follow Boston Dynamics’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;announcement last June&lt;/a&gt; that it was making the Spot Explorer robot available to any company that could afford its $74,500 price tag. The way Boston Dynamics describes it, today’s announcements are a response to the kinds of features Spot’s early buyers have been asking for. The company says there are currently over 400 Spot robots out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zNfv9B"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Boston Dynamics Spot Enterprise with Spot Arm|100522" data-volume-uuid="3c38f540b" data-volume-id="100522" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-720" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RdxZut"&gt;“Customers in a lot of industries have sites with important equipment that are largely unstaffed, and it could take hours to dispatch someone to go check on something relatively simple,” Spot’s chief engineer Zack Jackowski tells me over a video call. “What they want to do is to put a Spot there permanently. That way, the person who is attached to follow up on an alarm going off or a routine inspection can just dial into a robot, stand up, and go take a look around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OrHcEQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just dial into a robot, stand up, and go take a look around”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mYTwc"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ web-based Scout software is part of its attempt to streamline remote control. For now, it mostly turns Spot into an expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8294855/telepresence-robots-double-robotics-remote-skype-office"&gt;telepresence robot&lt;/a&gt;. Boston Dynamics tells me its new arm doesn’t work with its web-based software yet, making Spot better suited to inspecting and photographing an environment rather than physically interacting with it. Once the robotic arm is integrated with Scout, however, the robot should be able to do things like operate valves, pull levers, or turn handles, while its operator sits hundreds or even thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt7YAf"&gt;Scout works with the company’s existing Spot Explorer, as well as the new Spot Enterprise robots. Although the new robot also features other upgrades like a more powerful CPU designed to run more advanced autonomy algorithms in the future, its self-charging capabilities are the major new feature. While the current Spot Explorer has around 90 minutes of battery life, the new Spot Enterprise can live on a remote site with a charging station “indefinitely.” When combined with Scout, the hope is that businesses can use Spot as an alternative to dispatching personnel to remote sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BK_vi0KtypUBESHj32OlAfa1-sY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275356/Enterprise_Industrial._Credit_to_Boston_Dynamicsjpg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spot finds its charging station using the QR code-style “fiducial marker” you can see behind its hind legs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrNOHY"&gt;The charging station works using “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker#:~:text=A%20fiducial%20marker%20or%20fiducial,reticle%20of%20an%20optical%20instrument."&gt;fiducial markers&lt;/a&gt;,” small QR-code-like pictures that Spot’s cameras can identify and use to navigate. Once it’s close enough to the charging station to see its marker, Spot is able to position and lower itself so it comes into contact with the charging connectors on the stand. The stand also includes a hardwired internet connection, which makes it quicker and more reliable to upload sensor data gathered by Spot during its travels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8QTwg"&gt;Scout needs to work over slow internet connections because Spot is designed to be deployed in remote locations like offshore oil fields or underground mines. Jackowski estimates that controlling Spot only needs a “couple of megabits” of internet bandwidth (for reference, Netflix currently recommends &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"&gt;3 Mbps of bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; for streaming in SD). This low bandwidth requirement is achieved by doing as much of the heavy processing onsite as possible, so Spot isn’t reliant on an internet connection to get around. The system relies on a Boston Dynamics server installed on the same local network as the robot to process and compress Spot’s data before sending it over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxVps_FPQJZ0VW30nnJtkNneFdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275361/Scout_workfromhome_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scout’s interface shows a live video feed from the robot, alongside a series of simple controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UkRlrq"&gt;It’s been possible to control Spot over the internet before now. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267379/robot-dog-rocos-boston-dynamics-video-spot-shepherd-reaction"&gt;Rocos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/i-walked-the-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog-remotely-and-only-crashed-once-formant/"&gt;Formant&lt;/a&gt; have offered third-party control tools, and Boston Dynamics itself has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price#H9wpJb:~:text=One%20feature%20that%20Boston%20Dynamics%20is,assault%20course%20in%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20headquarters."&gt;demonstrated software&lt;/a&gt; that it said would let potential Spot customers remotely test drive the robot around an assault course in its headquarters. But Scout is the company’s first streamlined, web-based software for controlling its robots, and customers will be able to use it to control their robots regardless of where they may be in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="07q2G4"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6DdxYD"&gt;To show off the software, Boston Dynamics let me take one of their new Spot Enterprise robots for a spin, giving me control of the robot in their Waltham, MA lab from my apartment in London over 3,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Gxe8"&gt;It will not surprise you to learn that using Scout to pilot Spot through my browser was a laggy experience — nevertheless, it was still manageable. I could either control the robot like an action video game with my WASD keys (Jackowski tells me a game controller paired to my PC would have also worked), or via a point-and-click control scheme that’s not unlike what you’d find in a classic adventure game. You click on a point in the environment, and Spot walks to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s0YyG"&gt;Controlling Spot felt like playing a low-resolution video game via a laggy streaming service. There was a significant delay between me pressing a button and the robot responding, and I’d probably have been constantly crashing into things were it not for Spot’s built-in obstacle avoidance technology. It felt like playing a game with assists like invisible walls turned on. I’d click a patch of ground behind a traffic cone, and Spot would walk to it while avoiding the cone. I directed the robot up a set of narrow stairs, and Spot walked up them while keeping itself away from the sides. There’s even an especially video game-like third-person view that uses the robot’s sensors to show its position in a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scout can use the robot’s sensors to show the robot in a video game-like third-person view. Click in the environment to have Spot move to that point. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I6uVGj"&gt;It’s also possible to cede control to the robot completely in cases where it’s patrolling the same route every time. This can be pre-programmed by Spot’s operator, and the robot can be set to dock and charge itself between patrols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQP0VW"&gt;Remote control like this carries its risks. Boston Dynamics set up its demonstration to let me log into the control interface for the robot without a username or password, simply by following a link sent to me by the team. But in the real word Jackowski tells me there’ll be a lot more security around the 70-pound plus robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqs1DX"&gt;“We’ve implemented best practices for security at every layer in the system,” Jackowski says. “The robot and the server both practice full data encryption both in transit and at rest,” and Boston Dynamics uses “standard battle hardened web protocol technologies.” He adds that all the equipment in use is taken through a security audit by a third-party company, and said he expects most customers to use VPNs to add a further layer of protection to the connection between an operator’s local system and the robot’s remote site.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Boston Dynamics / Scout&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video feed is laggy and low-res, but the robot’s obstacle avoidance makes it manageable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eNd4R8"&gt;Beyond Spot Enterprise and Scout, Boston Dynamics is also announcing the release of the Spot Arm, a robotic limb that attaches to the head of the robot that can do things like “close valves, pull levers and turn handles and knobs.” It’s functionally similar to what Boston Dynamics showed off in previous viral videos, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/20/17033982/boston-dynamics-spotmini-door-opening-video-interrupt-test"&gt;this one from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s more robustly designed and ready to be used in the real world. Jackowski tells me the team has integrated the arm with Spot’s existing controls, and has pre-programmed it with certain actions like being able to open a door or turn a valve. It’s not yet compatible with Scout, but that’s apparently in the works for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzCp7c"&gt;While he wouldn’t say exactly how much the new Spot Enterprise will cost, Jackowski admitted it’ll be more expensive than the existing $74,500 Spot (which Boston Dynamics plans to continue to sell). Meanwhile, the robotic arm will also be made available to owners of existing Spot robots, so long as they’re prepared to send their devices in to Boston Dynamics to have it professionally fitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOI4Qe"&gt;Boston Dynamics recently made headlines after automaker Hyundai acquired a controlling stake in the company in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;deal that valued it at $1.1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked about the deal, Jackowski said that it hadn’t resulted in any change in direction for the team, and said they were excited to benefit from Hyundai’s extensive manufacturing supply chains and expertise. Even before the deal was announced, however, it’s clear Boston Dynamics has progressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/14/5209622/google-has-bought-robotics-company-boston-dynamics"&gt;beyond moonshots&lt;/a&gt; and entered a far more practical phase of its life, allowing any company with the cash to buy its robots for use in the real-world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOVhOH"&gt;But that doesn’t mean its R&amp;amp;D work is at any risk of slowing down. Selling each new product means getting feedback from real-world customers about what the company needs to work on next. That feedback loop will only intensify with the release of the Spot Arm. “We have some ideas for how folks are going to use it, but they’re gonna come back to us really quickly and say no no you didn’t quite get it totally right,” Jackowski predicts. “Let us tell you what’s gonna make this really valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PITNFX"&gt;“When we introduce this arm, it’s gonna be like the original Spot again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCTR4j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kuo adds fuel to Apple-Hyundai electric car rumors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC4sUl"&gt;TF Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo has corroborated reports that Apple and Hyundai are working together on an electric car. In a research note quoted &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/02/kuo-apple-car-to-use-hyundais-e-gmp-platform-gm-and-psa-eye-partnerships"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kuo says that Apple’s first car will be based on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for battery-powered electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1KbDg"&gt;The E-GMP platform was &lt;a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/-0000016584"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late last year and is expected to be the basis for Hyundai’s electric cars from this year on. Hyundai claims that E-GMP vehicles can theoretically get over 500km (310 miles) in range on a full charge, with the battery able to reach 80 percent capacity in 18 minutes via fast charging — though individual vehicle performance would of course vary based on design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDVpEd"&gt;Kuo claims that the first Apple car will be produced together with Hyundai, but other vehicles involving collaboration with GM and PSA are also a possibility, and Apple will have to make use of automotive partners’ supply chain resources. Hyundai is said to be “taking the lead in component design and production” on the first car, while its smaller subsidiary Kia will be responsible for producing vehicles in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lc0qo3CAP7zdx8V8Gdw61rQRvIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275313/csm_hyundai_ev_platform_e_gmp_01_e2e_0eaf8b99a1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyundai’s E-GMP electric vehicle platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fGsiK8"&gt;Last month Hyundai confirmed local reports that it was in talks with Apple before &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/hyundai-shares-jump-most-since-1988-after-report-on-apple-tie-up"&gt;walking back its statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve been receiving requests for potential cooperation from various companies regarding development of autonomous EVs,” read the statement’s final version. “No decisions have been made as discussions are in early stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzLZkb"&gt;Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-tech-apple-hyundai-motor-focus/hyundai-wrestles-with-the-risks-of-embracing-apple-idUSKBN29Y0FU"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that Hyundai leadership was “divided” on the prospect of an Apple partnership. “We are agonizing over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,” an unnamed executive was quoted as saying. “We are not a company which manufactures cars for others. It is not like working with Apple would always produce great results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmWCNm"&gt;Kuo believes that the earliest possible date for an Apple car to hit the market is 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
