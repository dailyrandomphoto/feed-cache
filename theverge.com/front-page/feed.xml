    <title>Unopened copy of Super Mario Bros. sells for a record $2 million </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aB2MzEfQmaNXc5LpO58VxS4sfH8=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69693503/rally_super_mario_bros.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An unopened Super Mario Bros. game from 1985 sold for $2 million | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/1985-super-mario-bros/" target="_blank"&gt;Rally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rz6nBq"&gt;An anonymous buyer paid $2 million for a never-opened copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros&lt;/em&gt;., according to collectibles site Rally. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/business/super-mario-bros-sale-record.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; the sale price of the 1985 game broke a record that was set less than a month ago, when a sealed copy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572688/super-mario-64-most-expensive-video-game-ever-heritage-auctions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; went for $1.56 million&lt;/a&gt; at auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPIxl6"&gt;Over the past year, the record for most expensive video game has been broken numerous times, as the demand for childhood collectibles remains hot. Last July, a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;went for $114,000&lt;/a&gt; at auction. In November, a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt; broke that record, selling for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591120/super-mario-bros-3-record-breaking-auction-price-condition-sealed"&gt;$156.000 at auction&lt;/a&gt;. Then, that record was smashed in April when a copy of&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;went for $660,000&lt;/a&gt; at auction, followed in July by a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;went for $870,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2mUmB"&gt;While most of the records were broken by vintage games that sold at auctions, the $2 million &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bro&lt;/em&gt;s. sale went a slightly different route. &lt;a href="https://rallyrd.com/"&gt;Rally&lt;/a&gt; buys games and other collectibles like comic books, and turns them into small companies that people can purchase shares in, like an investment. If someone makes an offer to buy the collectible, those investors vote whether to sell it. Rally bought the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros&lt;/em&gt;. game for $140,000 last April, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported, and shareholders approved the sale to the anonymous collector. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Major record labels sue Charter Communications again for alleged copyright infringement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dB9DcrG5J99B8wCfVBuiHkzvdqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69693295/acastro_170712_0000_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Several record labels are suing an ISP for copyright infringement | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hq7WOc"&gt;A group of major record labels has filed a new lawsuit against Charter Communications alleging that the company has failed to address its subscribers’ copyright infringement of musical works. And it’s not the first time the labels have sued Charter for its subscribers’ alleged behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqpIx6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22768104/03919578489.pdf"&gt;In a complaint filed in US District Court in Colorado&lt;/a&gt; July 26th, Universal Music, EMI, Sony Music, and Warner Music, along with several subsidiaries, claim that Charter, which provides internet services as Spectrum, “has insisted on doing nothing despite receiving thousands of notices that detailed the illegal activity of its subscribers, despite its clear legal obligation to address the widespread, illegal downloading of copyrighted works on its Internet services, and despite being sued previously by Plaintiffs for similar conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE1vOU"&gt;The same group of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282679/riaa-sony-universal-umg-lawsuit-charter-music-piracy-high-speed-internet"&gt;companies sued Charter in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, claiming Charter had received notices that its subscribers were using BitTorrent and other services for pirating music. Between March 24, 2013 and May 17th, 2016, Charter had “reaped substantial profits from massive copyright infringement committed by thousands of its subscribers,” the &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.187729/gov.uscourts.cod.187729.1.0.pdf"&gt;2019 complaint&lt;/a&gt; states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fb2pjT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“flagrant and serial infringers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2uQjDh"&gt;The new complaint covers infringement that allegedly occurred between July 26th, 2018 to the present, which the labels claim they detected as they monitored Charter’s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8JXMW"&gt;The labels claim in the complaint that they notified Charter, sending 150,000 notices of infringement, including the unique IP addresses of “flagrant and serial infringers” numbering in the “tens of thousands” on Charter’s network, but that the company turned a “blind eye” to the alleged activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtLeVF"&gt;Charter declined to comment on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vhT4L"&gt;The new suit is the latest attempt by record labels to hold ISPs responsible for instances of copyright infringement by their subscribers. In 2019, a group of labels won a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030812/cox-communications-record-labels-lawsuit-appeal-1-billion-piracy-isp-charter"&gt;$1 billion verdict against Cox&lt;/a&gt; Communications, after a court found it was liable for infringement of more than 10,000 musical works by its subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="va4SIl"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NevWIe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 7th, 1:23PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that Charter declined comment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Turtle Beach’s Recon is a multitalented wired Xbox controller</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Much more utility than your average controller&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="YLT9Ie"&gt;Turtle Beach is known primarily for making gaming headsets, but it recently launched its first controller called the Recon for the Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC. It’s a $59.99 wired model available in black or white that doesn’t feel all that different from Microsoft’s wireless controller. What little it does change design-wise is ultimately successful, and I’ll get into all of that shortly. But I want to focus first on the Recon’s killer feature: customization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3s7sm"&gt;When you plug headphones into its 3.5mm headphone jack, the panel of buttons at the top of the Recon can be used to make a host of changes to your game and chat audio as well as your microphone. You can choose between four equalizer presets that range from focusing more on bass to a treble-dominated sound. Mic monitoring can be adjusted, and you can opt to let more of your voice come through in your headphones if you want, should they have a built-in mic, or you can mute the mic altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zwERBG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10689524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLvuZa"&gt;The Recon also lets you adjust the game audio and the chat volume independently with two rockers, one at each side. (Note: the chat mix function works on Xbox consoles only, not on PCs.) Turtle Beach even put in a “Superhuman Hearing” button — a signature feature from its headset lineup that emphasizes easy-to-miss sounds like footsteps, doors opening, and other key sounds that might help clue you in ahead of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN7tOp"&gt;Essentially, the Recon brings must-have headset features to a controller, lowering the barrier to entry for how many gaming accessories you need. That’s great and all, but you’ll need patience and practice to conquer the inelegant button layout that enables these features, and the others mentioned below. Everything works as intended, but you’ll need to keep the instruction manual within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach Recon controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-b7T-e9dMmLr0t6LJtWnXH27bA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766763/cfaulkner_210805_4697_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These two rear buttons are mappable to any input outside of analog stick movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OnzT2c"&gt;In addition to tweaking the sound, the aforementioned buttons also let you make several adjustments to how the controller, well, controls. The Recon lets you map any function from the controller (aside from analog stick movement) to one of two macro buttons located behind the controller grips. The last feature is called Pro-Aim, which lets you toggle between four levels of slowed-down sensitivity for the right-hand stick. When you activate the setting and toggle through the options to find your preferred level of sensitivity, holding down the rear right macro button will slow the stick’s movement speed accordingly, making it potentially easier to line up your shots compared. It works fantastically, though it’s programmed to work only on the right rear button, so it’ll overwrite a custom function if you’ve assigned one to the same button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkKx1v"&gt;Rear buttons aside, the Recon feels similar to the Microsoft Xbox controller that debuted alongside the Xbox Series X / S consoles. This wired version has rubber-coated grips, and I really like that its shoulder buttons are completely covered in little raised dots that make them less slippery. (Microsoft’s controller has these, too, but they cover a smaller surface area on the buttons.) Turtle Beach includes a lengthy 10-foot braided cable, so it should be able to work with most entertainment center arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach Recon controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhckPm40gn2eNyFrFKcXhsSDtz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766760/cfaulkner_210804_4697_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a small touch, but I like that Turtle Beach completely covered the shoulder buttons in raised bumps for extra grip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QB26wO"&gt;Compared again to Microsoft’s latest controller, the Recon controller’s face buttons and triggers require a similar amount of force to press. The Recon’s sticks require a bit more force to click in. There’s also an eight-way d-pad that will feel like a big improvement if you’re still using the older Xbox wireless controller made during the Xbox One days. Otherwise, you won’t notice much difference if you’ve used Microsoft’s new controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkltA1"&gt;One final note: this controller supports rumble on Xbox consoles, but PC support for rumble is very spotty. The Recon worked just fine on my PC with &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Streets of Rage 4&lt;/em&gt;, but other titles that I tried didn’t provide rumble feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1CuXm"&gt;If you already have a wireless controller and a wireless headset that you like, the Recon controller isn’t really for you. It’s meant more for people who already own a set of headphones that they like and want to extend its capabilities without spending more than they need to. Despite Turtle Beach’s less-than-perfect execution with how to access its many customization features, I’m still glad that those features exist in a $59.99 controller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report finds Doximity, a social network for doctors, is riddled with anti-vaccine comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2VDmQLz5KrbmaliVTHpOnEVTn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692977/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaccine misinformation appears rampant on a social media site for doctors | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H5wAkq"&gt;A social media site for doctors is seeing “hundreds of comments”— many with false claims and conspiracy theories— on posts about the COVID-19 vaccine and the pandemic, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Doximity is limited to healthcare professionals in the US— it verifies members before they can join— and no one who posts to the site is anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Y9VI"&gt;Doximity also doesn’t allow users to post articles or stories; instead it posts items from medical and science publications and mainstream news articles. Each user has a feed of aggregated content that is customized for them, based on the user’s preferences including area of medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9If3m"&gt;But Doximity members &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on articles, which is where the misinformation and conspiracy theories seem to proliferate, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported. For instance, it found comments on a recent article about face masks for children included many from doctors who oppose the vaccine, saying masking children was “ridiculous” and “a form of child abuse.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoM8DV"&gt;This, despite the overwhelming evidence and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;guidance from public health organizations&lt;/a&gt; that masks help prevent the spread of the virus, and, the fact that there &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-next-stage-of-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-in-united-states-children-under-12/"&gt;isn’t yet a  COVID-19 vaccine approved&lt;/a&gt; for children under 12 years old. And, despite rules in Doximity’s own &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/clinicians/community_guidelines"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; which list “spreading false or misleading information” as grounds for removal from the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5x1q7"&gt;Doximity is scheduled to release its &lt;a href="https://investors.doximity.com/news/events/event-details/2021/Doximity-Q1-2022-Earnings-Call/default.aspx"&gt;first-quarter results&lt;/a&gt; on August 10th. The company, which was founded in 2010, launched its IPO in June, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021012935/doximity-424b4.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it had 1.8 million members, which included 80 percent of physicians in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1jpl"&gt;The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s full report here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter appoints “grievance officer” to comply with India’s new rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SqJWPpaO3qwuQjBKlnGRIKUyyng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692794/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has hired a grievance officer in India | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xl6u9i"&gt;Twitter has appointed two new executives in India in an attempt to comply with the country’s new information technology laws, a company lawyer told the Delhi High court at a Friday hearing. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/twitter-says-has-appointed-officials-to-comply-with-india-rules"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the new executives is a chief compliance officer who will also serve as &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india"&gt;grievance officer,&lt;/a&gt; and the other is a nodal officer, both required by the country’s Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code which took effect in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBellz"&gt;Twitter made the appointments a week after the Indian government found the social media platform’s efforts to comply with the new rules were insufficient. Under the rules, social media companies are required to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a legal order. The country also requires such companies to have a grievance officer who acknowledges users’ complaints within 24 hours, a chief compliance officer, and a contact person who would be available to respond to law enforcement agencies 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ2v4l"&gt;But on July 28th, &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/total-non-compliance-by-twitter-hc/articleshow/84845519.cms"&gt;a judge found that Twitter’s appointment&lt;/a&gt; of an employee through a third-party contractor to be the grievance and compliance officer was “unacceptable.” The rules require that officer to be a senior staff member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwVxjg"&gt;The government had argued in a legal filing last month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;Twitter had lost its legal immunity&lt;/a&gt; for failing to adhere to the new rules, making it legally liable for content posted by its users in India. In May, police &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter’s India offices&lt;/a&gt; after the platform labeled a government official’s tweets as “manipulated media.” And in June, a government minister warned the platform there could be “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to comply with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JkmVb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We have taken significant steps towards compliance to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 and have kept the Indian Government closely informed of our progress,” a Twitter spokesperson in India wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. “We remain committed to safeguarding the voices and privacy of those using our service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SP3oM9"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, India’s government will now review whether the new appointments meet the rules, and will hear the case again on August 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAw2tv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOR1g4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mtk5F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream-video-1-QXEVV1DWRGG001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt9WI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhEfkS"&gt;It’s time for another roundup of this week’s best deals. You may have already seen some of these if you’ve been keeping up with our deals coverage every day, but I’m sure there are some surprises in here. Before that, though, &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/24672525.29/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNTg2MjY0L2JhY2stdG8tc2Nob29sLWdpZnQtaWRlYXMtY29sbGVnZS1kb3JtLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXN1cHBsaWVzLXRlY2gtZ2FkZ2V0cw/60ca3936dba83e5914705c33B27cc4c40"&gt;check out our newly-published Back to School gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. The beginning of August marks when many people who attend school realize how little time they actually have to prepare for the school year ahead. If that describes you or someone you know, I hope that our guide helps you. Otherwise, carry on to see what we’ve brought you this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zyCmUi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dz9eqL"&gt;Get a Nomad case for your MacBook or iPad for half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ikdI"&gt;Nomad is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers an exclusive discount on some of its polyurethane (PU) leather cases and sleeves for the latest MacBook models (both 13- and 16-inch), as well as the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeRoundup08072021/https://nomadgoods.com/collections/pu-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Take a look at its offerings&lt;/a&gt;, and if you see something that you like, punch in the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEDEALS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to see its price fall by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="POvYiC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yVGwxh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wdponA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, PS5 is up to 50 percent off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwMGbR"&gt;Whether you have any attachment to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; or not, it’s worth picking up the &lt;em&gt;Remake &lt;/em&gt;for PS4 or PS5, as it’s both very good and more affordable than usual for a limited time. You can grab a &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000/"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; or buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZS80PC2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free with purchase) for $30, down from $60&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeYHpa"&gt;If you have a PS5, the special edition called Intergrade that includes the new Yuffie episode in addition to the base game is just $50 &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177/"&gt;digitally&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XNRM6QN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on disc&lt;/a&gt; (usually $70)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="klBXvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ujHVF2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kssq3u"&gt;A three-pack of Google Wifi routers is $150 at Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KCIfvF"&gt;One of this week’s most popular deals was, unsurprisingly, this fantastic sale on a three-pack of Google Wifi routers. Normally $200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s still $150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Google usually charges $100 for a single router, but you can outfit your home with a whole mesh Wi-Fi system comprised of three routers (each of which has dual gigabit ethernet ports) for just $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HeKQc8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xcgb2c"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AWz9nc"&gt;The 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in red is $300 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WIvIiw"&gt;The best deal currently available on the Apple Watch Series 6 is at Woot, where you can get &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-40mm-productred-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in the all-red colorway for $300&lt;/a&gt; (normally $400). This is the model that we see discounted most often, perhaps because of its divisive color scheme. Just to note: $250 is the lowest price that we’ve seen for this one, and Apple may unveil the successor to the Series 6 at its annual fall hardware event. But, if you need a watch now, this is a solid deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kc2ufm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify says it plans to add AirPlay 2 to its iOS app — eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDD20yR_WaPMtNUO2rsOrGSinnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69690480/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qolgag"&gt;Spotify still hasn’t added AirPlay 2 support to its iOS app — but despite the delay, it’s still “working to make [it] a reality,” the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Some doubt was cast on AirPlay 2 inclusion when &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/spotify-pauses-airplay-2-support-for-ios-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; spotted a forum post&lt;/a&gt; where a Spotify forum moderator claimed that &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/iOS-Airplay-2-Support-for-iOS/idc-p/5244350/highlight/true#M235171"&gt;“audio driver compatibility issues”&lt;/a&gt; might mean the feature wouldn’t be added for the foreseeable future. Spotify now claims that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIlb4R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received the following statement from Spotify regarding AirPlay 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="l6Ose4"&gt;A post on one of Spotify’s Community pages contained incomplete information regarding our plans for AirPlay2. Spotify will support AirPlay2 and we’re working to make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5hM8lP"&gt;AirPlay 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17403684/airplay-2-ios-114-stereo-homepod-available-now"&gt;added as part of iOS 11 update&lt;/a&gt;, introduced multiroom audio, Siri voice control, and fairly broad support across a wide swath of speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173637/tv-airplay-2-apple-lg-samsung-sony-vizio-ces-2019"&gt;televisions&lt;/a&gt;, and streaming services. It was a real first for Apple’s “casting” feature, which had previously been somewhat poorly supported outside of Apple’s own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIY2Ct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’m not going to call it petty, but...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w59IH1"&gt;Spotify has its own way to get audio from its service to other devices in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/"&gt;Spotify Connect&lt;/a&gt;, but considering Spotify already supports Google Cast, skipping Apple’s newest streaming protocol would seem like an odd omission. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes, Apple provides a seemingly simple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/getting_airplay_2_into_your_app"&gt;four step developer document&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to enable the feature. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?s=20"&gt;developer Marco Arment points&lt;/a&gt; out that the fourth step (adopting a new API that supports enhanced buffering) is a bigger hurdle than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BhtYf6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;…and that new API:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is barely documented&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- has no public sample code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is full of major gotchas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- can’t change speeds seamlessly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- doesn’t provide precise timing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- requires much more complex logic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is less efficient, which can cause background CPU-overage terminations&lt;/p&gt;— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ALoR"&gt;But add in that Spotify has a less-than-friendly relationship with Apple, even going as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;filing an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;publicly calling it a bully&lt;/a&gt;, and a choice to not prioritize incorporating AirPlay 2 makes even more sense. It’s good that it’s still happening, but for any Spotify subscriber on iOS, it’s hard to not feel like you’re caught in the crossfire between two tech giants on the outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlsirN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 6th, 6:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and added statement from Spotify confirming it is working on AirPlay2 support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tmCRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox night mode dims your screen, controller, and power button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nn4Z7kqWuOGTF4uou6FL5fJZzow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691100/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTGRkI"&gt;Microsoft is working on a new night mode for Xbox consoles. The software giant has started testing this night mode with Xbox Insiders in the &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/06/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2109-210804-2200/"&gt;Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt; today, and it allows Xbox owners to dim their screens, controller LED brightness, and even the Xbox power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88GLAW"&gt;The night mode has a lot of customization, including different dimming levels and an optional blue light filter. Microsoft is also allowing Xbox owners to dim the LED brightness on their controllers in this night mode and dim the Xbox power button light or turn it off. You can also set an Xbox to switch to the system dark mode and disable HDR when the night mode is enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-KsnZIhfZsEUnLZw7NhBErpD50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22767178/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_08_06_22_27_18.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox night mode lets you dim a controller LED brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NtT7NJ"&gt;This Xbox night mode can also be set to a schedule, either a manual one or an automatic one that will enable it at sunset and disable it at sunrise. Microsoft is currently testing this with Xbox Insiders, so expect to see it filter through the various testing channels in the coming weeks before arriving on all Xbox consoles soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp lead and other tech experts fire back at Apple’s Child Safety plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGtA_nWVkDJWCy43HTsdInDqf6Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691082/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I80BZO"&gt;WhatsApp won’t be adopting &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;Apple’s new Child Safety measures&lt;/a&gt;, meant to stop the spread of child abuse imagery, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?s=20"&gt;WhatsApp’s head Will Cathcart&lt;/a&gt;. In a Twitter thread, he explains his belief that Apple “has built software that can scan all the private photos on your phone,” and said that Apple has taken the wrong path in trying to improve its response to child sexual abuse material, or CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoRGi4"&gt;Apple’s plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;which it announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, involves taking hashes of images uploaded to iCloud and comparing them to a database that contains hashes of known CSAM images. According to Apple, this allows it to keep user data encrypted and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1423726172849033216?s=20"&gt;run the analysis on-device&lt;/a&gt; while still allowing it to report users to the authorities if they’re found to be sharing child abuse imagery. Another prong of Apple’s Child Safety strategy involves optionally warning parents if their child &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1423389211542032384"&gt;under 13 years old&lt;/a&gt; sends or views photos containing sexually explicit content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612934/apple-vp-memo-concerns-privacy-new-scanning-photos-images-ios"&gt;An internal memo at Apple&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that people would be “worried about the implications” of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zcRqL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I read the information Apple put out yesterday and I'm concerned. I think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people's privacy all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have asked if we'll adopt this system for WhatsApp. The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOKTKj"&gt;Cathcart &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701476841385988?s=20"&gt;calls Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt; “very concerning,” saying that it would allow governments with different ideas of what kind of images are and are not acceptable to request that Apple add non-CSAM images to the databases it’s comparing images against. Cathcart says WhatsApp’s system to fight child exploitation, which partly utilizes user reports, preserves encryption like Apple’s and has led to the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701475595755524?s=20"&gt;reporting over 400,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2020. (Apple is also working with the Center for its CSAM detection efforts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuhKXJ"&gt;WhatsApp’s owner, Facebook, has reasons to pounce on Apple for privacy concerns. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;changes to how ad tracking works in iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; started a fight between the two companies, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;buying newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Apple’s privacy changes as harmful to small businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple fired back&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the change “simply requires” that users be given a choice on whether to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1dseaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cathcart calls Apple’s approach “very concerning,” and he’s not alone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLRoUJ"&gt;It’s not just WhatsApp that has criticized Apple’s new Child Safety measures, though. The list of people and organizations raising concerns includes Edward Snowden, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, professors, and more. We’ve collected some of those reactions here to act as an overview of some of the criticisms levied against Apple’s new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TJSuYM"&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZcaWR"&gt;Matthew Green, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, pushed back on the feature before it was publicly announced. He tweeted about Apple’s plans and about how the hashing system could be abused by governments and malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="My9zJN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These tools will allow Apple to scan your iPhone photos for photos that match a specific perceptual hash, and report them to Apple servers if too many appear.&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423072476888805376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpR2F"&gt;The EFF &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; that blasted Apple’s plan, more or less calling it a “thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor.” The EFF’s press release goes into detail on how it believes Apple’s Child Safety measures could be abused by governments and how they decrease user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jacoNW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple's filtering of iMessage and iCloud is not a slippery slope to backdoors that suppress speech and make our communications less secure. We’re already there: this is a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change. &lt;a href="https://t.co/f2nv062t2n"&gt;https://t.co/f2nv062t2n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EFF (@EFF) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1423375818693038084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yuo1qD"&gt;Kendra Albert, an instructor at Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic, has a thread on the potential dangers to queer children and Apple’s initial lack of clarity around age ranges for the parental notifications feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6bBV1n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The idea that parents are safe people for teens to have conversations about sex or sexting with is admirable, but in many cases, not true. (And as far as I can tell, this stuff doesn't just apply to kids under the age for 13.)&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423367106972852228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="p5xtGT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;EFF reports that the iMessage nudity notifications will not go to parents if the kid is between 13-17 but that is not anywhere in the Apple documentation that I can find. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW"&gt;https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423436593696854018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqw4k"&gt;Edward Snowden retweeted the &lt;em&gt;Financial Time&lt;/em&gt;s article about the system, giving his own characterization of what Apple is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CCaMt8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple plans to modify iPhones to constantly scan for contraband: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is an absolutely appalling idea, because it is going to lead to distributed bulk surveillance of our phones and laptops,” said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ"&gt;https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1423387232963022848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sceSPL"&gt;Politician Brianna Wu called the system “the worst idea in Apple History.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wB779u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the worst idea in Apple history, and I don't say that lightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It destroys their credibility on privacy. It will be abused by governments. It will get gay children killed and disowned. This is the worst idea ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2"&gt;https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BriannaWu/status/1423384759858774026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="H0QULK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to state: Apple's scanning does not detect photos of child abuse. It detects a list of known banned images added to a database, which are initially child abuse imagery found circulating elsewhere. What images are added over time is arbitrary. It doesn't know what a child is.&lt;/p&gt;— SoS (@SwiftOnSecurity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1423383256003747840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1g6Co"&gt;Writer Matt Blaze also tweeted about the concerns that the technology could be abused by overreaching governments, trying to prevent content other than CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PouZDU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In other words, not only does the policy have to be exceptionally robust, so does the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;— matt blaze (@mattblaze) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1423476875817635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rvN3WU"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney also criticized Apple, saying that the company “vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default.” He also promised to share more thoughts specifically about Apple’s Child Safety system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wfglq3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s atrocious how Apple vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default, hides the 15+ separate options to turn parts of it off in Settings underneath your name, and forces you to have an unwanted email account. Apple would NEVER allow a third party to ship an app like this.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423728945225211908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kuuOuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will share some very detailed thoughts on this related topic later.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423730378234376206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YCGmI"&gt;Not every reaction has been critical, however. Ashton Kutcher (who has done &lt;a href="https://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/14/moore-kutcher-join-our-crusade-to-end-child-sex-trafficking/"&gt;advocacy work to end child sex trafficking since 2011&lt;/a&gt;) calls Apple’s work “a major step forward” for efforts to eliminate CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFDxLg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe in privacy - including for kids whose sexual abuse is documented and spread online without consent. These efforts announced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; are a major step forward in the fight to eliminate CSAM from the internet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX"&gt;https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aplusk/status/1423387418451922950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in the US are required to wear masks again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-LOGISTICS-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0LIFX_QoVHjYmnymk5ncpVclZM=/194x0:4606x2941/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691038/1232843235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ronny Hartmann / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MC8zj"&gt;Amazon informed US warehouse employees on Friday that it is once again requiring them to wear masks to work in response to the spread of the more contagious COVID-19 delta variant (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/amazon-resumes-mask-mandate-in-warehouses-amid-rising-covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/amazon-tells-warehouse-workers-to-mask-up-again-as-virus-spreads?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says it offers &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/more-than-half-a-million-amazon-frontline-employees-have-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-through-on-site-vaccination-events"&gt;access to vaccines to over half a million of its employees&lt;/a&gt;, but it will require employees to mask up, regardless of their vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDpp8l"&gt; Amazon confirmed the mask mandate in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wMnFhi"&gt;In response to the concerning spread of new COVID-19 variants in the U.S. and guidance from public health authorities and our own medical experts, we are requiring face coverings indoors regardless of vaccination status. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to follow local government guidance and work closely with leading medical healthcare professionals, gathering their advice and recommendations as we go forward to ensure our buildings are optimized for the safety of our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bw6utH"&gt;Non-warehouse employees currently don’t have to deal with Amazon’s policy change. The company recently adjusted its return-to-office plans on August 5th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;pushing back its return date&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. Like other companies, Amazon had &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/amazon-wants-office-workers-back-3-days-a-week-in-september?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously considered implementing a hybrid work schedule&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to bring office workers back to offices for at least part of the week starting on September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hod8UR"&gt;Taking the extra precautions for warehouse employees seems like the right idea if it plans to continue having staff work in person. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;reported in October 2020&lt;/a&gt; that 19,816 workers of its 1,372,000 frontline employees across Whole Foods and Amazon had COVID-19 “or where presumed positive” from March 1st to September 19th, 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJePFy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gWfpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
