    <title>Volkswagen is really rebranding as ‘Voltswagen’ in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMZw1oqsursZ1FT2ZyxUpONW9c4=/0x120:716x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048185/Large_13212_VoltswagenAnewnameforaneweraofe_Mobility.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zveic"&gt;Volkswagen is changing the name of its American brand to Voltswagen, in a not-so-subtle nod to the German automaker’s multibillion-dollar effort to become the biggest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HgHZ6"&gt;The company was apparently planning to make the announcement at the end of April but accidentally published a press release about the name change early Monday afternoon, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html"&gt;first spotted by CNBC&lt;/a&gt; before it was taken down. The proximity of the name change to April Fool’s Day initially raised suspicions that it was just a joke. But VW insists that it’s a real thing, so here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6VX75"&gt;The company confirmed the change to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499#images"&gt;the announcement was later published on Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;. The larger Volkswagen Group (which sits over brands like Audi, Porsche, and others) will keep the Volkswagen name for its American division. The name change will officially take effect May 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9uMfTO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The name change will officially take effect May 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuLxzz"&gt;It’s not clear how the new name will be incorporated into the company’s upcoming slate of electric and gas-powered vehicles. For example, will it appear in any of the branding for the VW Atlas SUV, which typically gets 24 miles per gallon of gas? It seems doubtful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r18ZZb"&gt;“We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Voltswagen of America, in a statement. “The idea of a ‘people’s car’ is the very fabric of our being. We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires. This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64GkK4"&gt;The name change is by far the most outrageous move from Volkswagen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;draw attention to its electric vehicle efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Others include Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/20/22240725/volkswagen-herbert-diess-twitter-elon-musk-vw-tesla"&gt;joining Twitter and letting a bit loose&lt;/a&gt;, a la Elon Musk, and the company’s recent “battery day” event, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;showed off the technology it’s developing&lt;/a&gt;. (Musk also authored a name change of his own recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;taking on the title of “Technoking” at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqPvW"&gt;But while the company is pouring tons of money into this push into EVs, there is currently only one long-range electric Volkswagen for sale in the United States: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;the ID 4&lt;/a&gt; SUV. The US also currently lags behind China and Europe when it comes to overall EV sales, despite being home to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF4We6"&gt;Voltswagen — sorry, Volkswagen isn’t the only legacy automaker leaning on groan-worthy puns or redesigned logos to emphasize its shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to ones powered by electrons. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;General Motors unveiled a new logo meant to evoke the shape of an electrical plug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wFRdw"&gt;We’re still waiting on the news that Ford is changing its name to the atomic symbol for Lithium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google celebrates the unblocking of the Suez Canal with a small boat parade in search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EGYPT-SUEZ CANAL-TRAFFIC-RESUMPTION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsotSuSJqOtD3rcTS8zllPyGxTQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048067/1232015129.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKWLsu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/25/22350300/suez-canal-ship-stuck-ever-given-boat-stuck"&gt;The big boat&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"&gt;no longer stuck&lt;/a&gt;. After days of rapt attention from the internet, a non-metaphorical rising tide has indeed lifted all the boats — and particularly, the Evergreen Marine Corporation’s Ever Given cargo ship — reopening the Suez Canal to regular shipping traffic and ensuring that the precious lifeblood of capitalism can continue to flow freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MqrGft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I shed a single happy tear for the big boat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wcDcrF"&gt;Naturally, Google is celebrating this simultaneously momentous and absurd moment in human history the only way it knows how: an Easter egg in Google searches for the phrases “Suez Canal” and “Ever Given” that show a tiny parade of cute lil’ emoji boats marching across your screen, just like the (much bigger) boats that can now (less cutely, one presumes) float their way through the aforementioned canal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK2KGgtqGRJ9uNuugbqO1F0fJW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407705/boat.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AtBTh7"&gt;There’s probably a larger metaphor to be made about the flow of information on the internet that Google search facilities and the similarly unrepressed flotilla of real-world cargo now making its way through the canal, if you really wanted to. Or you can just enjoy the fun emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUHReB"&gt;Float on, little boats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Resizable BAR frame rate boosts now available on all 30-series GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NK44W7DaatMN8xxvfwqn484YYU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048041/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OCbGQm"&gt;Nvidia is launching Resizable BAR support today, a feature of PCI Express that can boost frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. Resizable BAR works by unlocking access to the full graphics frame buffer, instead of limiting it to 256MB block reads. This can improve frame rates in games, but it will require a compatible CPU, motherboard BIOS update, and even a VBIOS update for all 30-series desktop GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDe6aF"&gt;Nvidia has been working with both AMD and Intel to provide chipset support. AMD’s Zen 3 CPUs are supported, alongside Intel’s 10th Gen processors and the company’s new 11th Gen desktop chips that launch today. You can find &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22357980%2Fnvidia-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus-available-now" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s full FAQ on motherboard and VBIOS updates right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzYFZh"&gt;Resizable BAR works the same as AMD’s Smart Access Memory, which also promises to improve frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. The frame rate increase using both will really depend on the game, and resolution will also impact how much performance will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fInGao"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;new RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; was the first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302679/nvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus"&gt;include Resizable BAR last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-resizable-bar-tested-with-evga-rtx-3060-xc-black/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wccftech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that it improved performance between 4 and 11 percent in certain games. Nvidia initially limited support to fewer than 10 games, as the company warned enabling it on all games might result in performance decreases in some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DTOkH"&gt;Nvidia is now pre-testing titles and using special game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only where the performance increases. That means that only 17 games are currently supported, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion. &lt;/em&gt;More games will be added in future driver updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN76oF"&gt;Resizable BAR support on the AMD side has been tested thoroughly, and &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2178-amd-smart-access-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechSpot &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some games making use of Smart Access Memory could see a nearly 20 percent boost at 1440p and 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s dinosaur eggs have hatched, and now raptors roam the island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cLDCVwqdd3Pvj_zgAS6wqHPdic=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048016/Ext9ydQW8AETyig.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4SOxO"&gt;The newest season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;dubbed “Primal,”&lt;/a&gt; did two main things: it introduced animals to the island and added a prehistoric theme. So it’s only fitting that the latest update includes a dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK67q9"&gt;Thanks to a recent patch, raptors now roam the battle royale game, joining other predators like wolves and sharks. They appear to spawn at random, however, so there’s no guarantee you’ll encounter one in a match; I played for more than an hour this morning before I spotted one in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pXlLZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KgCPVN"&gt;In traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, the news had been teased over the last few days; giant eggs scattered across the island began to crack, hinting that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; was in the works. It was reminiscent of previous events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525410/fortnite-volcano-eruption-season-9-alien-runes-spaceship-loot-lake"&gt;the volcano eruption&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin the rolling cube, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20691016/fortnite-robot-mech-season-10-countdown-kaiju-monster-patch-940"&gt;the time a massive robot was slowly constructed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;the game’s unique approach to storytelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AevYI3"&gt;This is the first major update for season 6, so there could be other creatures on the way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zqf8s1BA__I3V10P5ytyiwHAX_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406522/Fortnite_20210329165502.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen Core i9 processor boosts Microsoft Flight Simulator by 20 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCgSyJxWiUIsyQzK7DdLIWe-lA=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047970/intelcorei9_11900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel delivers a speed boost and PCIe 4.0&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EnDGaS"&gt;I built a new gaming PC in September to play new games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. I figured that picking Intel’s Core i9-10900K and Nvidia’s RTX 3090 would make this machine last for years and offer top tier performance in demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. I was wrong. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a notorious beast of a game and is quickly becoming the new &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;test for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKZ5ER"&gt;It has struggled to run smoothly above 30fps with all settings maxed out at 1440p on my PC, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;AMD’s Intel-beating Ryzen 9 5950X&lt;/a&gt; only improved the situation slightly for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aEXza"&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor arrives with a big promise of up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements over the existing i9-10900K, and more specifically the lure of 14 percent more performance at 1080p in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; with high settings. This piqued my curiosity, so I’ve been testing the i9-11900K over the past few days to see what it can offer for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UzxkC"&gt;It’s less than a year after the i9-10900K release, and I’m already considering upgrading to Intel’s new i9-11900K because I’ve found it boosts &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4td3oPFclFVU8HrC0dgiUwB_8_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407556/intelcorei9_11900K_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fl32l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t typically review processors, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-11900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6ezT"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K ships with eight cores, 16 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz. On paper, that sounds like it would be less powerful than the 10900K with its 10 cores, 20 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, but the reality is far more complicated thanks to how games and apps are designed. Most of &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; currently runs in a main thread that’s often limited by how well your CPU can run single-threaded applications and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jhmwDG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNPoqR"&gt;So in recent years Intel has managed to stay on top with its single-threaded performance, despite AMD offering more cores. That was until AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X managed to beat the final Intel performance advantage late last year. Intel’s new 11th Gen chips are trying to reclaim its traditional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CgKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a good example of where Intel typically has an advantage. It’s also an increasingly rare example of a game that’s very sensitive to your entire system components and not just how good your GPU is at rendering games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDPhrmvWPvKMfg19eXP2K3EY4eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407557/705ff7fe_2f40_4e85_a2fd_b17a854aee38.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;em&gt; is a demanding title on PC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="L89LfM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4YXju"&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K does its job well enough here to boost performance by around 20 percent depending on resolution. I’ve tested a variety of flights taking off from different airports and flying over some of the world’s most beautiful locations and the most demanding cities the game has to offer. Everything feels smoother with Intel’s latest chips, but the results aren’t dramatic enough to get me beyond 60fps without stepping some settings down. A flight over Seattle with all the settings maxed out shows a 24-percent performance improvement with the new 11th Gen Core i9 at 1080p and an 18-percent increase at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Loo0e0"&gt;On my i9-10900K PC, I saw average frame rates of 38fps at 1440p and 33fps at 1080p. The Core i9-11900K managed to bump these to 45fps average at 1440p and 41fps average at 1080p. Averages during a particular benchmark don’t always tell the whole story, though. Over the hours I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve noticed the game dip and stutter less than before. It’s still not perfect, but it’s certainly smoother overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQb8jl"&gt;If I dial the game back to high settings, it immediately jumps to a 66fps average at 1440p — demonstrating just how much the ultra settings hit frame rates. I can personally barely notice the difference between high and ultra settings in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so the boost here is noticeable thanks to the smoother gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAxDG"&gt;I also tested &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;and the Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 benchmarks. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; saw a tiny bump of around 3 percent at both 1080p and 1440p, while the i9-11900K managed some impressive single core performance gains in both Cinebench and Geekbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xOQgPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10419602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8W7P"&gt;I should note I was also hoping to do most of my testing with my existing Z490 motherboard, but that didn’t go to plan. I swapped the chip in with the latest BIOS update for 11th Gen processors and found that the system rebooted a few minutes into games without even a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). I wasn’t able to troubleshoot it fully in time for review, but the Asus Maximus XIII Hero (Z590) board supplied by Intel worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXgm4G"&gt;You should be able to easily use 11th Gen processors with Z490 motherboards, as most manufacturers have already issued BIOS updates to support Intel’s latest processors. Some will even support M.2 NVMe storage using PCIe 4.0 with these latest chips, while others like Asus only support PCIe 4.0 on the Primary PCIe x16 slot with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ywp8M4"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen processors finally deliver PCIe 4.0 support, and that’s good news for storage. Manufacturers have started to fully support PCIe 4.0 drives in recent months, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, GigaByte, and MSI all launching high-speed drives. If you have a compatible PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will certainly be worth it. I’ve managed read speeds of 6729MB/s and write speeds of 5206MB/s using Western Digital’s new SN850 1TB drive. Corsair’s MP600 also manages 4987MB/s read and 4259MB/s write speeds. Using Intel’s older 10th Gen chip, the Corsair drive managed 3484MB/s reads and 3235MB/s writes, so an 11th Gen upgrade improved speeds by more than 40 percent. If you work with a lot of files every day, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will be worth it for PCIe 4.0 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JD0BzaEMSVfes6_0gQATqsY1B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407569/xF0EPe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 has super fast PCIe 4.0 speeds with Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12kbsp"&gt;I don’t think the Core i9-11900K does enough for me personally to upgrade from a 10900K, but the PCIe 4.0 support would tempt me more if I needed the speeds there. At $550 (if you can find it at this retail price), the Core i9-11900K sits in between AMD’s offerings, being less expensive than the top 5950X and 5900X Ryzen 9 chips and $90 more than the 5800X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HgZj"&gt;There’s some solid single-thread performance here, and the 11900K and AMD’s 5900X and 5950X all trade blows depending on the games. Intel’s performance improvement will come at a cost of energy efficiency, though. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that the 11900K “sets the new high power mark” in several of its power tests, drawing over 200 watts in the same test that AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X drew 116 watts. If you even need a new CPU, it’s worth considering just how much Intel’s latest chips will influence your energy bills and the games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWfCyt"&gt;Whether you decide to upgrade to Intel’s 11th Gen or one of AMD’s chips will probably depend on the games you play and stock availability. A lot of games do a bad job of utilizing multiple cores on CPUs, mostly because console gaming hardware hasn’t offered solid CPU performance and spreading multiple rendering and physics threads across different cores can complicate game design. Intel’s new chips do a better job of handling these single threads to improve performance, but it’s very game-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCEapG"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the general consensus is that the game desperately needs to be moved to DirectX 12 for improvements to multi-core CPU performance. But Intel’s IPC improvements have managed to help until the Direct X 12 update arrives with the Xbox Series X release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF8rmK"&gt;Where Intel might have an advantage over AMD here is availability of chips. It has been increasingly difficult to find AMD’s latest Ryzen processors in recent months, thanks to a global chip shortage. Intel partners have already been accidentally selling some 11th Gen desktop CPUs, which may indicate it will have a steadier supply in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p7mm3d"&gt;The winner between Intel and AMD will be the company that can get these chips into the hands of PC gamers eager to upgrade. Much like the GPU market right now, benchmarks don’t matter when the best chip is often the only one you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo and Aurora team up on fully autonomous trucks for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlp-AJbU554P6qwA9s7J3QVRRKg=/105x0:1155x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047931/Volvo_Blog_Cover_1260x700__Rendering_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FZ20LC"&gt;Volvo is partnering with self-driving startup Aurora on a new lineup of fully autonomous semi trucks, the companies announced. The trucks will be deployed in North America on highly frequented hub-to-hub routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv07Rk"&gt;The deal between Volvo Autonomous Solutions and Aurora — which was founded by former executives from Google, Tesla, and Uber — is a “long-term partnership spanning several years,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E1pOuy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“long-term partnership spanning several years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dke6G2"&gt;It’s also the latest partnership between a major OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and an autonomous technology startup, as the industry continues to slowly inch toward a future with more fully driverless passenger vehicles and trucks on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV8jKv"&gt;Aurora has been testing its “Aurora Driver” hardware and software stack in its test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331418/aurora-self-driving-cars-semi-truck-av-texas-robotaxi"&gt;fleet of minivans and Class 8 trucks in the Dallas-Fort Worth area&lt;/a&gt; since last year. Unlike its rivals, which are largely focused on robotaxi applications, the company has said that its first commercial service will be in trucking “where the market is largest today, the unit economics are best, and the level of service requirements is most accommodating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrIYdA"&gt;“Creating a viable autonomous on-highway offering requires close partnerships with both customers and tech partners to develop the needed capabilities,” says Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, in a statement. “This exciting partnership brings our goal of transport as a service an important step closer and will accelerate our commercial offer for hub-to-hub applications in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJYEz3"&gt;To date, Aurora has raised $690 million in funding, and co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson has been hailed as the &lt;a href="https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-aurora-a-safe-path-to-scale-autonomous-vehicles-bd0680fa4fe0"&gt;“Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles,”&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his work helping to pioneer Google’s self-driving car initiative. His co-founders are Sterling Anderson, who helped lead Tesla’s Model X project, and Drew Bagnell, who ran a research lab at Carnegie Mellon then left to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber. Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, and EV startup &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/aurora-will-power-byton-evs-autonomous-driving-features/"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt; are also Aurora customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE0qcl"&gt;The company raised half a billion dollars last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215575/amazon-innovation-self-driving-car-startup-google-tesla-executives"&gt;in a funding round led by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;It also acquired Uber’s autonomous division&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;teamed up with Toyota and Denso&lt;/a&gt; to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COZdPd"&gt;Volvo, which is the second largest manufacturer of heavy duty semi trucks, has been gradually adding more partially autonomous features in its trucks but has yet to strike a deal to build fully driverless delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHg0Fz"&gt;Long-haul trucking is likely to be one of the first broad applications of automated driving technologies. Indeed, there are widespread fears in the trucking industry that autonomous technology will lead to enormous displacement among truck drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSX7Le"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/managing-transition-driverless-road-freight-transport"&gt;A 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; found that automated trucks could reduce the demand for drivers by as much as 50 to 70 percent in the US and Europe by 2030, with 4.4 million of the 6.4 million professional drivers on both continents rendered obsolete. These fears are heightened as tech companies introduce eye-catching, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923232/einride-tpod-self-driving-truck-sweden-logan"&gt;cabin-less prototypes&lt;/a&gt; designed to cut the driver completely out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJFOAM"&gt;There’s been a flurry of partnerships and other corporate deals in recent years in the nascent driverless trucking industry, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic casts doubt on the long-term viability of using autonomous vehicles for passenger transportation. Established players like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;Daimler said they would be joining forces with Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, while newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310209/tusimple-self-driving-truck-network-ups-xpress-penske"&gt;TuSimple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/self-driving-truck-startup-ike-raises-52-million/"&gt;Ike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2019/09/25/self-driving-startup-embark-raises-70-million-opens-freight-hubs-for-robot-big-rigs/"&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/plusai-autonomous-truck-completes-coast-to-coast-delivery-in-3-days/568729/"&gt;Plus.ai&lt;/a&gt; are also working toward fully driverless trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s latest Starship landing attempt ends in destruction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIcoSbK0opim4b1NokJ3N-NF4uo=/45x0:2745x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047925/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.06.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the last visuals from SpaceX’s SN11 before it exploded. | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKsTXN"&gt;Another Starship prototype exploded Tuesday morning during an attempt to nail a tricky landing technique at SpaceX’s test launch facilities in Texas. The landing attempt followed a clean liftoff and a demonstration of the rocket’s autonomous in-flight maneuvers, marking SpaceX’s fourth high-altitude flight since December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2NXnH"&gt;The SN11 rocket launched at 9AM ET in foggy weather at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities, soaring roughly 6.2 miles to test the rocket’s three Raptor engines and a number of in-flight maneuvers that steer it back to land. As SN11 neared peak altitude, the engines gradually shut down to begin its free-fall back toward the ground before executing a “landing burn” — when one Raptor reignites to carry the rocket gently down to a landing pad not far from where it launched. At least, that’s the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pJvn"&gt;“Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted shortly after the explosion. “Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dpcm92"&gt;A live camera feed aboard SN11, streamed by SpaceX, froze moments before its landing attempt. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDL-ZMRHYrE"&gt;Another feed&lt;/a&gt;, provided by the website NASA Spaceflight, showed large chunks of debris raining on SpaceX’s Boca Chica facilities, though the landing explosion itself was obscured by fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTKHCN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Final view of SN11 in the air:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;➡️&lt;a href="https://t.co/Q2p3q1HS0i"&gt;https://t.co/Q2p3q1HS0i&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/PNJta9svkA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PNJta9svkA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris B - NSF (@NASASpaceflight) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/1376885901847113731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ntGXpJ"&gt;“Looks like we had another exciting test,” SpaceX’s John Insprucker said on SpaceX’s live stream, suggesting the vehicle was lost in another eventful landing attempt. “We do appear to have lost all the data from the vehicle, and the team of course is away from the landing pad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9vbcZ"&gt;“At least the crater is in the right place!,” Musk tweeted. One of SN11’s engines “had issues” during ascent and didn’t fire strongly enough during the landing burn, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAWUo"&gt;While the fog ruined views of SN11’s landing attempt, a weather radar from the National Weather Service in Brownsville, Texas detected a plume of gas that indicated an explosion in mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfbenP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If anyone on South Padre Island, or in the Boca Chica area, Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, etc received an abrupt and startling wakeup this morning, this was probably it. Our radar was able to see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SN11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SN11&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately explode in mid-air. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RGVwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RGVwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/txwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#txwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ohyyq3bIpf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ohyyq3bIpf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Brownsville (@NWSBrownsville) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBrownsville/status/1376891946346676227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021 announced as online-only event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4iHHOJmM_ffEj6TupX83HJTEmo=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047863/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obnno"&gt;Apple just announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will take place on June 7th through June 11th this year, and that like last year it will be an online-only event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDK3Ak"&gt;The announcement, as is typical for Apple, is opaque when it comes to details, but there might be a tantalizing hint: is the memoji character’s glasses simply showing a reflection from their laptop? Or could Apple finally be gearing up to announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt; or AR glasses?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPkLeT"&gt;“We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PHK6V"&gt;WWDC is when Apple typically details changes coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS with the occasional hardware surprise. Last year, it also dedicated a significant portion of its keynote to announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Mac lineup’s transition to its own Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt; processors. With this transition still underway, it seems likely that Apple will have an update to share about its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz8B8y"&gt;New hardware tends to be less of a focus at the developer conference, but it’s not unheard of. Apple used WWDC 2019 as its venue to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646424/apple-mac-pro-redesign-new-specs-features-photos-wwdc-2019"&gt;announce the new Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and at WWDC 2017 it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732144/apple-homepod-speaker-announced-siri-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;HomePod smart speaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/5/15740298/new-apple-imacs-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;updated iMac desktops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732350/new-apple-ipad-announced-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxhVo"&gt;It’s not surprising that Apple has opted to make its global conference for developers online-only given that the impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world. Facebook’s F8 developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346432/facebook-f8-conference-2021-date-virtual-event-sign-up"&gt;will be virtual this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con and the 2021 Anime Expo&lt;/a&gt; have also confirmed that their physical events will not take place. But some organizations are attempting to make limited physical events happen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;like Mobile World Congress in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQvr7t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPUrEP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4twj9d"&gt;Germany’s Lilium will be the latest electric aviation startup to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. Lilium will merge with Qell Acquisition, a SPAC founded by former General Motors executive Barry Engle. The newly formed company will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LILM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZOUex"&gt;As part of the announcement, Lilium unveiled a new, seven-seat electric aircraft that it says will launch as part of an inter-city flying taxi service in 2025. Previously, the company’s prototype was said to have only five seats — so we can assume that Lilium’s ambitions to ferry more passengers are growing along with its financial expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLPsM"&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup after the SPAC deals of &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/archer-to-go-public-through-merger-deal-with-spac-atlas-crest-receives-1-billion-order-from-united-airlines-2021-02-10"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;A SPAC is a blank-check corporation&lt;/a&gt;, formed as an alternative to an IPO, because it raises funds for an operation that doesn’t have revenue of its own. There have been a rash of SPAC deals involving companies in the transportation space, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/car-sensor-startup-aeye-goes-public-in-2-billion-spac-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/"&gt;micromobility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p4epoW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing startup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7atVeS"&gt;Lilium’s SPAC deal values the combined company at a pro forma enterprise value of $2.4 billion and an approximately $3.3 billion pro forma equity value. After the merger is finalized, Lilium is expected to receive approximately $830 million from the deal, including $450 million from a fully committed common stock PIPE offering and $380 million cash held in trust. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, at which point the company will start trading on the Nasdaq exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkK3z6"&gt;Engle, a longtime executive vice president and president of GM’s North America division, will join the board of the newly formed company, as well as former Airbus CEO Tom Enders. Engle described Lilium’s product as “a highly engineered aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKHkRX"&gt;The type of aircraft Lilium is developing is typically called a “flying car,” electric-powered, able to carry only a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. These types of vehicles are still in their prototype phase and have yet to be rolled out for commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAuIUF"&gt;The company completed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;first phase of testing&lt;/a&gt; of its five-seater 36-rotor electric prototype in October 2019, with the aircraft hitting speeds of 100km/h (62mph). Lilium says it remains “on track” to launch passenger operations in several locations around the world by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hlUSdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UeWrd"&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph at 10,000 feet and a range of 155 miles. That’s slower and with less range than the company’s projections for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;five-seater jet&lt;/a&gt;, which Lilium said would have a top speed of 186mph and a range of 186 miles. Still, the company says it is the “culmination of five years of technology development across four generations of technology demonstrators, including Lilium’s full-scale 5-Seater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIxKeF"&gt;Lilium applied for certification with the US Federal Aviation Administration in 2018, which typically can take several years to complete. The company has also applied with Europe’s EASA for certification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaJTe"&gt;Of course, many companies — Lilium included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal fight&lt;/a&gt; with its former investor, Boeing. And last year, Germany’s Lilium Jet had a &lt;a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/"&gt;prototype catch fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RWoOQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The resale app’s co-founder on stitching e-commerce with social media&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JmyIDi"&gt;E-commerce has seen a huge wave of growth during the pandemic, and my guest on today’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; has gained experience riding this wave. Tracy Sun is the co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark, a fashion resale company that just went public earlier this year. The Poshmark app is a different kind of riff on e-commerce, though — it’s part catalog, part social network, and part creator platform. It competes with similar apps like Depop and Etsy, but also things like Instagram and eBay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVTlI5"&gt;All of that means Poshmark has a unique set of challenges: Tracy has to manage regular e-commerce issues like shipping logistics and customer service, as well as influencer economy problems like burnout and the incessant need to grow follower counts. Not to mention the universe of problems that come with selling fashion, like dealing with fashion labels. But if Poshmark can get it all right, Tracy thinks community is the future of retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5f0oA"&gt;Tracy Sun, co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/here/710"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h9bZHi"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5032085775" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bBeekc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVt7jf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy Sun, you are the co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in2bID"&gt;Thanks. I’m so happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqfhDe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really excited to talk to you. Poshmark is really interesting. It’s a shopping app with a really strong social element. It has basically a social network embedded into it. Explain what it is and how it works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okxo9A"&gt;Sure. So it is a bit of a different experience. Poshmark is a social marketplace, which combines the human connection of a physical shopping experience with the scale, reach, ease, and selection benefits of e-commerce. If you think about it, shopping has been around for a very long time. And if you think back to the markets and more recently, malls, and more recently, no more malls — people just like to connect, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok2jyp"&gt;You go to the local farmer’s market and you like to know who grows your lettuce, or you like to speak to the shopkeeper at a store, to find out how to style things. And with the rise of e-commerce, what’s happened is a lot of that human connection gets stripped out. And what you get is just, like I said, ease, selection, all that stuff. But what Poshmark does is it brings back a lot of that really innate human connection that happens around shopping and combines it with e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ21OR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That human connection in your app is, it’s people, right? You sign up for Poshmark, you open the app, you follow some brands, that’s the first prompt, but really you’re following people. There are strong echoes of Instagram in this entire experience, right? Is that the main focus for you, is you’re going to follow actual people on the app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67Gc7l"&gt;You follow people as a means for discovery, as a means for connection. So what we see on Poshmark is people are on the app 27 minutes a day, and that’s not an engagement stat that you typically see in commerce. It’s an engagement level you see when there’s more things to see, more people to talk to, content’s changing, there are conversations going on. That’s the level of engagement we really see today. And that’s what’s happening on Poshmark. People come, they look at their feed, they talk to people who are selling things, asking them questions like, where did you get that? How do I pair that skirt with a pair of shoes? How does this fit? There’s a whole bunch of conversations going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf6Rdl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That 27 minutes, is that the mean or the median? Because it feels like you probably have some sellers who are on there eight to 10 hours a day, and then people like me that bang through all their social apps for 30 seconds before they go to bed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngoqYv"&gt;Sure. That 27 minutes is an average of everyone who’s active on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E7h0s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the interesting problems for all social apps that I always think about is the flywheel of getting started. So you started Poshmark in 2011, now you’re a public company, you just IPO’d in January. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NGMYJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’d you get the flywheel started, right? You’re asking people to sell products, to spend money, to put things in boxes and ship them. That’s a lot more than a TikTok or a Clubhouse or Instagram. You’re asking a lot of users, how’d you get the flywheel of engagement started?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8VXxE"&gt;That’s such a good question, and I actually remember back in 2010, Manish [Chandra] and I — Manish is a co-founder — I sat there and I asked him, “Do we get buyers first, do we get sellers first, do we get inventory?” because in 2010, not only were there not social marketplaces, people did not embrace reselling on a mass scale yet. So in addition to flywheel, we had to convince everyday people that you really do have items in your closet you can sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VLyFER"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkKSWs"&gt;So, what we ended up doing is inadvertently going after all three at once. We met people, so not buyers, not sellers, not people with inventory, but just people who we thought would want to connect over commerce, and these are everyday people. So people that you feel like you could walk down the street and see them on the street. We went and talked to some fashion bloggers who were not shy to take photos of themselves because again, Instagram had not really become big yet. So the idea of a selfie was not in our lexicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSrnA"&gt;So we really found just digitally savvy, fashion-loving people who loved to get together and talk about style. And we actually had physical events that brought them together. And during these physical events, we taught them how to use the app. And they really, really took off and started making it their own. And so what we found, to answer your question about flywheel, is these people became buyers, they became sellers, and they switch back and forth. And so what we focused on is really recruiting people and the flywheel took care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufwMfX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting, because you run a commerce platform, but the dynamics you’re describing, they’re the same dynamics as every social platform with creators. And I think that’s one of the more interesting tensions with every company that has creators on it. You have to service the creators, but you also have to make a great user experience. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMz9R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have many more people who are just consumers, but if you don’t have the creators, if you don’t have the sellers, you won’t have the buyers. Who do you think of as the more important cohort of users? Who do you spend your time thinking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHy2mP"&gt;We typically spend most of our time thinking about our sellers because they, as you call them, they are the creators and we’ve focused our product strategy on helping the sellers become more and more successful. So we’re always thinking about, what are additional tools we can give them, to further engage their buyers? So in a way, we do focus on buyers as well, but through the lens of our sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fukQJQ"&gt;An example of that is we recently launched a feature called “Dropping Soon.” And what that does is it enables sellers to notify interested parties and say, “Hey, I have this special product and it will drop tomorrow at 9AM”. And our buyers love that. So they get notified, they’re so excited. They like the item in order to receive this notification. They wait for the drop to happen. The drop happens, our seller can schedule it. It fans out to everyone who has signed up to be notified and then buyers come in and then they purchase and have a great time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKI8Lt"&gt;So this tool, we built it for sellers, but the sellers are using it to engage with their buyers, and that’s the approach we’ve taken for so much of the product strategy at Poshmark, we enable people, and the people that we’re enabling are our sellers, and then our sellers go and talk to our buyers through our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qe7jKl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I think is really interesting about that approach is you’re talking about your sellers, your creators on your platform, is like primary users of your platform, people who are, they call themselves “Poshers,” right, which is really a great word. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhNisk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other platforms like Depop, I see a lot of TikTok stars who are just selling some stuff over on the side on Depop, and they’re using that platform to monetize their main platform. How do you think about that relationship to Instagram and TikTok, all these places where there are other kinds of influencers who are looking for alternate revenue streams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svHg22"&gt;I think everything is converging. The idea of the rise of creators and creator economy — Instagram, TikTok — what we’re entering into is an era where content is easily created and accessible, and you don’t have to be what we used to call influencers, who have millions and millions of followers. You can be a creator and be a star in your own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewkuCa"&gt;So I do think worlds are colliding, and it’s a really interesting time where people are just creating a lot of content. And we’re seeing that in Poshmark, where the idea of creating a closet and putting it up for sale, that was something 10 years ago people only did if they wanted to make a career out of it. And what we’re seeing now is it’s now very easy through Poshmark to come in, and within a few minutes, you can have something up for sale, make 20 bucks, go on with your life, and come back whenever you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYMwyi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you actively out there recruiting influencers on other platforms, creators on other platforms, to use Poshmark as a secondary revenue stream or even a primary revenue stream?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ds4K3"&gt;We do have a lot of creators on Poshmark and most of them are coming in through organic means. We’re creating more and more tools to help people express themselves in this way. So for example, last year we launched our short-form video called “Posh Stories.” And what it enables anyone to do on Poshmark, is really tell a story behind something you’re selling or in your closet or your inspiration. And that was received really well by our community because as you know, video is just so much more vibrant and so much easier to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtZyGl"&gt;And then just last week, we added to that product by launching listing videos. So now, as a seller, you can add a video product to every single item in your closet, but even more interesting as a consumer, you can just consume a stream of just what people are selling, they’re styling it, they’re telling you how to wear it, what it looks like. So it’s a really well-received engagement mechanism that is being consumed by both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFTlsz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said everything is converging, and as you’re describing your new features, the app that converges the most things into itself is Instagram, right? Any kind of interaction you can have in a social platform, Instagram either already has, or is rapidly copying. Is Instagram your biggest competition or is Depop your biggest competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHXKCD"&gt;Wherever people are spending their time is where we focus on, right? Because for us, we really want to help our sellers be successful and really engage them. So we want to build as many of those engagement tools as possible, so that they can stay on Poshmark and achieve as much of the social needs, as well as commerce needs, as they want. So we’re just heads-down, just focused on building out our social marketplace, and making sure that we really serve our sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITDmAO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, but let me push you on that. Instagram has shopping tools. They want people to spend money in there. Every time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve talked to Adam Mosseri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, I ask him why he won’t just take my credit card and turn [Instagram] into a catalog. Is that the biggest threat or is it a more head-up competitor like Depop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8oGyu"&gt;Well, let me tell you what our competitive advantage is. We built Poshmark grounds-up with commerce in mind. So when we say it’s a social marketplace, I don’t think all social features are equal. This is something that we thought about a lot in the early days of building Poshmark is you have to laser-focus on innovation, and you can’t just take innovation elsewhere and plop it onto a new customer without really understanding your customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8Pvia"&gt;So where we really focus is not just social, but how does social enable and unlock commerce. And so for us, nouns that we see elsewhere, like video or like follow. These are very standard social actions. On Poshmark, there’s always commerce intent behind them. So you’re pushing at competition, sure, you can shop on Instagram, you can shop on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/amazon/7"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can shop at your physical boutiques on Main Street when they start to open, there’s many places to shop, and there are many places to spend your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tIFgcu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think all social features are equal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzuvax"&gt;It used to be more TV, now it’s more online and TikTok. There’s many places to shop and spend time online. There’s very few places where you can socially engage and have every engagement point you do translate into a better shopping experience for you. And that’s where, yes, if you decompose Poshmark into pieces, we’re not inventing shopping, but everything you do, it changes your experience on Poshmark. So it’s like you have this virtual mall that’s ever-changing, and that’s what we’re focused on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpRFnC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this brings me to the question that I ask almost every co-founder and executive that comes on the show. This is a 10-year journey. You’re now a public company. You have this huge competition. You were talking about your focus. What is your decision-making framework, as you think about ways to expand Poshmark, you’re in charge of new markets. How has that decision-making changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S98E7l"&gt;It’s been a really interesting journey for me to go from being a really, really small founding team to now being an executive at a public company. I have never gone through that career journey before, just seeing a company evolve. And I love this question because, it’s really true, that decision-making, I might’ve said it gets more complicated as you get bigger, but now that I reflect on your question, I don’t think it gets more complicated, I think the inputs just change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Izg2p"&gt;So let me give you an example. In the early days, when there’s a handful of people, you just assume that everybody has the same amount of information, the same amount of context. Because it’s a startup and you’re an entrepreneur, and it’s like find product market fit or die, your north star is so focused. And there’s energy and adrenaline to getting there as a team together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT8x2Q"&gt;The urgency is so clear. And so all of that context enables really fast decision-making. A small number of people, everyone has the same amount of information, the urgency is extremely high, so you can’t really sit and contemplate it for a very long time. And so innately that small team makes the decision-making in a fast, urgent way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWVRwH"&gt;What I see now when we’ve got many, many stakeholders, many more than the early days, is now you have to really intentionally ask yourself, when you’re making a decision, who can help you based on the information they have? Do they have the context to help make the decision? What’s the level of urgency? There are some decisions we’re making that need an answer that minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehoIOZ"&gt;And then there are other questions we’re asking that we’ve been asking for a year now and still contemplating, right? Some more of the strategic questions that aren’t urgent, but super important. So that’s how decision-making has changed. What I would say is, I now have to be more intentional to think about all these factors and then incorporate that into what type of decision-making I am going to employ today, versus the early days, it was usually one type of decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrH4Lt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say what kind of decision-making I have to employ today, what are some types?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2TLbd"&gt;It’s like I was saying before, we make hundreds of decisions every day. Some of them are very tactical, and they’re small and they’re between maybe three people. So anyone in that foursome, if they have the same amount of information, they understand the same amount of risk and urgency. Any one of those people can make a decision. So someone raises their hand and goes, and we move on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uxpkg"&gt;What’s become newer at Poshmark, and in my world, is we look at what’s next. Where do we want to be in five years? Where do we want to be in 10 years? These are types of questions we’re asking that everybody’s coming in with a different context, different amount of information, different opinions. They’re so important to the future of the company, but not super, super urgent, they don’t have to be answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKaHWC"&gt;And so this decision-making involves a lot of people. We’re soliciting input from different departments, different levels inside the company and outside the company, and we’re taking our time to process and synthesize this information. This is a type of decision-making we didn’t make in 2011, right? It’s like contemplating, it’s existential. So more of this is coming and what I’m learning is to have some peace and not rush things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tslOrP"&gt;I think I’m telling you an example at the extreme endpoints of my Poshmark journey from day one versus today. But the truth is somewhere along the middle, like year five or so, is when things slowly started to shift and more important strategic decisions or questions started to come up. And I think, as that transitioned, I would feel urgency to move quickly because I might not have processed that these questions are slightly different and require slightly different decision-making frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VpQuj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re three months into being a public company now, I think. One of the things I hear from the people who work and who manage public companies is suddenly there’s a score every minute of every day. There’s a stock price that moves up and down. People want to see growth, investors want to see growth. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTbQ3G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My friends who are anchors on CNBC will bring executives on and say, “What are you going to do to move the stock price?” Have you felt that influence yet, just in this early moment of being in charge of a public company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxDe8l"&gt;Well, we certainly see the stock price. We certainly see people talking about the company in an hourly, daily, quarterly mindset. So we see it, we saw this coming, and I’d say that we have been building a culture of long-term mindset within the company for multiple years now. So as we prepare for this process, we really had to take our own mindset and make sure that we stay focused, be really clear on what you want to achieve and what it takes to achieve it, and spent some time working with our executive team and our overall team to just say, look, we’re making this change. We’re going from a private company to a public company. Here’s what’s going to happen, and here are the changes we have to make to be good stewards of the company to all of our stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsCQhz"&gt;However, our mission and our strategy and the way we operate, which is the culture with which we operate, will remain the same. And so we’ve really focused, we put a lot of energy into providing stability in the team and with ourselves to go through this transition and not have it rock your world. It shouldn’t rock your world, right? We’re still operating as Poshmark. It’s just now we have a new set of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTiuGT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, but they have a ticker. Walk me through, you had a meeting. Did you have a series of meetings where like this ticker is going to exist, we want you to pay not so much attention to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nc1xoX"&gt;I wouldn’t say we had a meeting specifically for that. It was more like, we care a lot about our culture and our team, and we know the pressure of what happens when things go up and when things go down, it can be very confusing for a company and for a team. And so because we care so much, we thought ahead of time, well before we listed; how might this impact our team, and what can we do to provide stability? And so we came out with consistent messaging well before we had to make sure that people’s north star was clear to them and you have to show, by example, things go up, things go down, but our strategy remains the same, and we reinforce that messaging through our all-hands and through individual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMucP1"&gt;So I wouldn’t say it was like everybody attended, but it’s part of, it’s weaved into everyday conversation. So when earnings calls happen or when these things happen, it’s not like, “Oh my gosh, crisis, everyone drop everything we’re doing.” It’s like, no, this is one more thing we have to do as a company, but we have 50 other things we’re doing, so let’s keep going on the 50 things, and we’ll have to do this 51st thing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B8mId"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me connect this to the people who use Poshmark; your sellers. I think a lot about hustle culture. I think a lot about creators, obviously. There was recently, I think, in December, there was a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; piece about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/get-rich-selling-used-fashion-online-or-cry-trying/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;people trying to make a living on Poshmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; doing resale. Do you think now as you’re getting bigger, is Poshmark a career for people or is it just a way to make extra money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3gyvf"&gt;It’s both. So, definitely there is a large group of sellers on Poshmark who are here to do it part-time or as a hobby. And the reasons they might do that is either to make extra money, it’s entertainment, it’s sustainable. There’s lots of different reasons why someone would want to casually sell on Poshmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChF5pA"&gt;What we do see is a growing number of people who are either full-time, professional, or wanting to be full-time and right on that precipice where they want to make that plunge, but they’re not sure how. And that’s a growing constituency on Poshmark and that’s something that we’ve seen, and I think it’s really exciting to be able to run a platform that could support people full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQn4Eh"&gt;So when I think about what’s ahead, there’s many things we’re focused on building and supporting high-volume sellers and giving them more and more tools, so that those who want to take the lead, find more comfort and find more support. And those who have taken the lead finding that they have more and more tools to be successful with this decision is something we’re really focused on. It’s one of our key growth strategies going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbQ3H7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I wanted to connect it to your journey and the public company conversation is, we’ve been talking about the path you’ve been on, how you make decisions over the course of the past 10 years. It’s very clear that there have been periods of just exponential growth for you as a person who runs a company, as an executive, the company going public. That’s an exponential growth moment in terms of investor dollars and in terms of the size and influence of the company. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lzytu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you think about an individual seller on your platform over the course of 10 years, the dynamic between the people who use the platforms and the platforms that serve them, it feels like it can remain very fixed. Are you thinking that, okay, if you are on Poshmark and you dedicate yourself to it for 10 years, you will have opportunities to scale with the business the same way that you had the opportunity to scale Poshmark itself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbrq3N"&gt;Yeah, I don’t think that an individual seller on Poshmark, if they joined many years ago, their experience is fixed. There’s a few major ways in which their experience has grown. What’s been really, personally, a beautiful career experience for me with Poshmark is everything we do, we’re on the same side of the table as our sellers. So we’re constantly trying to make their world unfixed. And we do it in a few ways. One is, the community’s grown. The number of users on Poshmark has grown astronomically over the years. And what that means for our sellers is fresh eyeballs, fresh buyers, more people to connect with. It’s a service we provide that we don’t often talk about. You’re building a business on Poshmark, but you don’t have to look for traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6lv4s"&gt;Not only do we bring traffic to you, we bring traffic to you every day, and as we increase our personalization tools, we’re bringing qualified traffic to you. And so that’s a way in which there are more buyers to acquire for each of our sellers, and as they get buyers, there’s more people that they can engage with and try to get as repeat buyers. So that’s the first. The second is we have increased our categories. So we used to be only a women’s fashion site, and we have since, a few years back, launched our men’s category, which actually both genders are participating in buying and selling. We’ve launched a home category, which last year during this crazy time we’ve been in, has skyrocketed as people are in their homes and finding more and more things to buy and sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fp0cnW"&gt;We launched beauty last year as well, and just recently last month, we launched pets for the four-legged family member. So as a seller, we have and will continue to increase the universe of the store that you can build and therefore the customers can build. And then the last thing I would say is there’s been a lot of innovation. So there’s video, there’s drops, there’s a whole bunch of new tools that we’re inventing for people to play with and see if it works for them and their store. So I would challenge your assertion that an individual seller over the course of years is fixed. I think that we’ve made it our mission to grow the platform, so they can grow, and I hope that they’re using these tools as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gmKUt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me stay on the challenging side of this question for a minute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swBsn7"&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnybdp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is the path of all social platforms. They add new features. There’s more buttons to push, there’s more formats to develop, there’s more categories to plan. In one sense, that’s all just more work. You talked about traffic, one of the clearest user / seller criticisms of Poshmark that I have read is you have to spend a lot of time just sharing stuff, sharing other people’s stuff to participate in the feed and draw traffic to your own store, and that’s just a lot of time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGp1du"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are some Poshmark sellers that just hire another person to do that sharing work, so they can get on with the other stuff. As you add more things to do and find more ways to be competitive, are you thinking about, “Okay, how do we scale sustainable business growth?” or are you looking at, the users are going to figure out how these tools all work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhonBQ"&gt;That’s a good point. So, there’s two things that come to mind. So first of all, as you add more features and it gets more complex, particularly for a new user, it can get very daunting, right? A new seller comes to Poshmark today, for sure, they’re seeing so many more features than someone who joined eight years back. So I do think putting extra attention on really guiding the seller, if they’re starting their journey today, to not get overwhelmed with all the advanced features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7f7jF"&gt;Really just laying it out for them: here’s how to be successful, and let’s not overwhelm you, as a way of just supporting you and empowering you. So that’s the first that I recognize as something we’re putting energy into, but we’ll have to continue doing that with time. And then going to the other part, for those that are not confused by features, but are just like, “Man, it used to be two things I have to do, and now there’s 15 things I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB9K5E"&gt;To me, that is a good choice to have. I don’t think that every tool we create is appropriate for every type of seller. The drops that I mentioned work really well for people with deep inventory. So boutiques that have 50 T-shirts, they used to have to create 50 listings, now they create one listing and they can market it to everyone who’s liked it and say, I have 50 SKUs behind this, and so it won’t sell out in a second. And so for them, the drops is an efficiency tool and we can measure that over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2fY67"&gt;That’s not going to work for an everyday, like, I just want to flip some of my closet items that I’m not wearing anymore. That tool doesn’t work. So we have different seller segments that require different types of tools, and I don’t think they’ll work for all of them. And we do want to be mindful and go towards seller efficiency and make sure the ROI is there, but I’m not sure if the goal should be, I want to do less work and make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lb3lcR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, that’s everyone’s goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxU5Ho"&gt;I don’t think that that should be our goal, right? We are in the business of helping people be successful. We want that person who is making $20,000 on Poshmark, if they want to make more, we want to give them the tools to enable them to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwFK9V"&gt;Well, if I think about Poshmark, right? If we want to grow, we need to grow our team. We need to grow our infrastructure. We need to build. There’s work to do to grow. And so we’ll always focus on ROI and try to make the effort as efficient as possible. But I don’t buy the “I must hire someone therefore I’m not successful.” It’s like, no, I think that’s amazing. If you are hiring someone to run your store, we just have to make sure we make it worthwhile for you, and we help direct your attention, so that that person knows what to do, and make it easier and easier for you, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFX8zO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, that’s the tension, right? You hire somebody because you think they’re going to enable you to achieve an even higher profit margin than you could do yourself. But once you start going down the road of servicing that community, the initial community of people who just want to try it out, they’re faced with doing the work of maybe three or four people, and that seems like the hard tension there for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzX8Xm"&gt;On Poshmark, we have some sellers who have 12 listings, right? And then we have some sellers with 12,000 listings and what’s required to run these two stores is vastly different. And if we can segment our sellers and really look at each persona and say, okay, the person who has 12 listings, they need this and let’s keep going on that, but the person who has 12,000 listings, they have a completely separate suite of needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIpmZf"&gt;And that 12,000-listing person, they would definitely fall under this high-volume seller that we’ve identified, and it is one of our focus areas right now, because that’s where we think that we haven’t done enough work. We were built for the 12-listing seller. We have a lot of tools to serve him or her, though the one who is more high-volume, that’s where I think we have some gaps in our platform that we’re working to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVRx5l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would make the comparison here to a more traditional social platform, YouTube, for example. YouTube is always described to me as the gold standard of creator monetization, and really all they do is serve ads for you and make it easy to do branded integrations and videos. People make a lot of money doing this. One of YouTube’s big benefits, though, is that your videos continue to exist on YouTube’s website, AdSense just keeps paying you for that long-tail archive of content. I think the best example of this is like kid video channels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHJ7hi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a toddler, my toddler watches the same five videos all the time. They’re just collecting that money. They don’t have to make any work, right? They get software-style margins from their content; they’ve paid to make it once, they’re selling it over and over and over again for effectively zero incremental cost. Depop sellers don’t have that. They have to get the clothes, they have to take the photos, they have to sell the clothes, get more clothes. Can you think of a way to add that higher-margin revenue line for your creators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ECciU"&gt;Well, in the world that we see today, it is possible for a boutique seller who has a store to put up 50 listings and kind of let it run itself. I don’t think that’s a great merchandising strategy and I don’t think anyone would do that in fashion, who runs a store. Because freshness is what drives the shoppers in, and talking to your customers is what converts them. So I don’t think the analogy is exactly the same.  So, for example, this boutique seller, she has her store going, now I’d say it’s less about running the store and more about talking to people who come in and converting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt4Rqz"&gt;And that’s where the energy goes. If you have a past customer who comes in again, being able to say to them, “Hey, you bought this size last time, do you want to buy the same thing in a different color?” Or, “I think this necklace would go great with it.” Those are the things where the energy and attention make sense. And that’s just very much part of commerce. I think what’s really great about that type of energy is I think we tend to gravitate towards the things we enjoy, especially if you spend that much time doing it. So I have to imagine people who create content on YouTube love creating video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFlVml"&gt;And like you said, you’re not one of them, I’m not one of them, but the people who run a store, they are merchants. They love running the store. And for most of the people I talk to who are in this world, the part they love is engaging with people. What they don’t love is dealing with logistics, shipping, the grungy part of customer service, like catalog stuff, but they love creating their store. And they love merchandising it there; what the entire assortment means together, how a shopper feels when they come into their store, those are all the positive, creative aspects of running a store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk8nql"&gt;So I think if we continue to give them room to innovate and create in those worlds and tackle as much of the stuff they don’t want to do, like inventory management, that kind of stuff, then we just enable people to really harness their love and tie that into whether it’s their job or their hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GtILh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That logistics stuff is kind of the heart of the Poshmark business. And it’s probably important to talk about, although I could talk about creator stuff forever. How do you make money? You charge creators a fee and then you help them with shipping, you help them with customer service, those are costs. But what is the fee structure like? When someone starts to sell on Poshmark, how much are you taking and what do you provide in return?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9x4hr"&gt;We take 20 percent of each sale, and getting started on Poshmark is completely free. Opening up your store, engaging with people, building your following. So the key to Poshmark is, as more and more people discover you and your store and they follow you, your reach gets bigger and bigger. So building that reach is part of the customer experience, and the only thing we monetize right now, if you’re successful, we take a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDoSUJ"&gt;What’s included in that? A whole host of things. So, starting from store setup: you set up your store, your catalog, all of that is managed and included. We maintain a growing community of shoppers. So like I said, you don’t need to drive traffic to your store unless you want to. We have a whole bunch of sellers who organically drive traffic to their stores from other social networks, and that’s just good for them. They’re practicing good customer acquisition strategies. However, we do have millions of buyers on Poshmark as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmkWdR"&gt;We take care of shipping through a partnership with USPS, so that as a seller makes a sale, they just have to print out the label and it’s already been paid for, and it’s already been pre-addressed. They just put it on and it’s priority mail, so it gets there super fast to their buyer. We take care of all customer service disputes, and we protect both the buyer and seller through our Posh Protect program. The world of chargebacks, for example, is a very painful reality for a lot of sellers out there in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyZS98"&gt;And our sellers do not really know what a chargeback is because we take care of it. We take care of all credit card processing. If there’s a problem with an item and a buyer’s not happy, we take care of that. So there’s a lot of not-so-fun logistics things that our team has solved, and then how we do it, honestly, is we understand it, we put people on it. But then, because at the end of the day, we’re a software company, we create software to help make it more efficient for us, so we can scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zH0YMT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you build your own internal software to scale things like shipping and customer service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktOtNU"&gt;That’s right. So I’ll give you an example of something that we’ve had to deal with that no one else would have to deal with, right? Oftentimes, you come and you engage with people and then you go away, but that engagement often leads to a sale. So you answer questions about how it fits, you do some price negotiation, whatever. So what you find is that, especially for casual sellers, their sales can come together in one day, right? So what we would see is people would make like three or four or five sales in one day, and they might, by accident, swap the labels, right? So they would send the wrong thing to the wrong person that would go across the country, and our customer service would get an email that was like, “I didn’t order this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivSbSy"&gt;And then simultaneously someone on the other side of the country would be like, “I didn’t order this,” and it’s just such an honest mistake for a busy person who’s trying to ship packages. So it would create such havoc in the early days because we’d have to track down this package and track down that package, and now everything is automated. So we have actually built it into the flow where the seller can say, “Oops, I swapped a package,” and then automatically our system takes care of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbvtzp"&gt;We auto-generate emails to the respective buyers with an apology. And in that email is a label that’s pre-paid, pre-addressed, so that all the buyer has to do is put it on. And in any case where there’s any bad buyer experience or bad seller experience, because everything is centralized and managed by Poshmark, we can pay attention to our levels of service for various people. And so we know when someone’s a seller who has a pristine track record, and then all of a sudden they make a human error — which happens — we can see their history and factor that into our decision-making and our systems do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9J1X1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying attention to your sellers, they have a pristine track record; there’s an element of this that Instagram creators don’t have, like star rankings. eBay merchants do. Where on the spectrum of that are you keeping track of your sellers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0cHjW"&gt;Well, I think when you’re trying to build a community of sellers, we were very intentional to try to create a world where anyone can enter today to become a seller and really have a great selling experience. You can imagine, over time — this happens in other places — where over time the sellers who are high-volume and do really well tend to dominate the entire platform because they have a million five-star reviews and they filter to the top and all these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObVnEt"&gt;And so we do want our high-volume sellers to succeed, and we want to create a world where anyone can start selling today and be successful. So that’s been something we’ve intentionally thought about from the beginning. An example of something that we’ve done a little bit differently to help manage that tension, is how we approach reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92z4aK"&gt;So, like I mentioned, in a lot of websites, you filter, or the sellers who have the most five-star ratings, they get preferential treatment. And as a buyer, why wouldn’t you want to gravitate towards those sellers? It guarantees a certain level of, they’re going to ship, they’re not going to steal my money or whatever. At Poshmark, what we have is we collect ratings on every sale. So we know if a buyer has complained about slow shipment or product quality or something like that, but we don’t expose it to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SXrh8"&gt;What we expose is if a buyer gives a seller a five-star review and they leave a comment like, “Wow, I love the seller, she gave me some freebies and she was a super fast shipper, I’ll buy from her again,” what we do is we post that comment to the seller’s page, and we call it a love note. And so what happens is these are just positive comments that people are leaving. So you can go to any seller’s page on Poshmark, and just read all of their love notes that were given by people who shop for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbeuJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re curating that? You have a team that’s looking through everyone’s love notes and saying, “We’re going to post these ones.”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzNvUZ"&gt;No. We post any comments as love notes that were published by buyers and gave a five-star rating.Out of five. Right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUyTW9"&gt;Now, if someone’s giving a one-star rating and they post a comment, we don’t expose it, so we don’t publicly penalize the seller, but internally we use all that data to make sure that the buyers are having a positive experience. And so if we have a seller that’s misbehaving or not providing the customer service that we would like, we can take corrective action, but we do it behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2iC12"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does corrective action look like? So you have a seller, they’ve got a bunch of one-star notes from people with bad experiences. Do you schedule a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/zoom/96"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adSnME"&gt;There’s an infinite combination of things that sellers can do where they start to — sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly — provide a terrible buyer experience, and we have a team of people that focus on that and create nuanced schedules of how we might deal with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWpFRv"&gt;So an example is, someone who ships slow has a different course of action versus someone who is violating our community guidelines, right? We think one is tolerable and can be rehabilitated. The other one is such a terrible experience and we have less tolerance for it. So each of these instances have different courses of action, but generally, once we sense that it has hit some sort of threshold, we will reach out to the buyer or the seller, and let them know that this is a problem, fill in the blank, and we expect something to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYprcf"&gt;And if it’s low urgency and the problem gets resolved, it could end there. But there are instances where a team does get on the phone with a buyer or seller, and really talk to them and try to understand, this is a repeated problem. It’s now escalated. What’s going on? And so we do have a team that reaches out and talks to people and gathers data on what’s going on. And in the extreme case, we will cut a seller off or a buyer off if they’re violating our guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfSre0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we’ve made it almost an hour and I have an executive from a platform company, and here we are at content moderation, which comes up on, I think, every episode of this show. You’re describing a content moderation policy. You’re saying there’s some stuff that’s against the rules. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eVWtl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the important constituents that you have to deal with from a moderation and policy perspective that most other platforms don’t have to is big brands, high-fashion brands, big consumer brands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQom63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your users are buying and selling their goods, they’re using their trademarks. Some of those brands are notoriously litigious. I know that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/02/01/the-realreal-cites-antitrust-concerns-in-counterclaim-to-chanel-lawsuit/?sh=5dd215f37360"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chanel and a competitor called The RealReal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; have just been in court forever. What is your relationship to the big brands like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAayCK"&gt;Well, in the world of content moderation, if any brand, big or small, flags for us that we’re in some way violating any of their trademark policies, we take that very seriously and work with them. So our relationship has been positive even from a content moderation standpoint, or like a trademark standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UChji"&gt;On the flip side, I think what we’re seeing is a shift as we grow, and as online is becoming more important and resale is becoming more important, and our engaged community is thriving. We’re actually seeing a whole bunch of inbound interest from brands on a positive note. Oftentimes, we’re seeing that a brand’s community on Poshmark is one of their largest online communities ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRdNJg"&gt;So we’re getting a lot of inbound interests saying, “Hey, how do I be part of the solution?” Whereas in the early days, it might’ve just been moderation. I think the future of working with brands is really bright in a way where we can combine forces and figure out how we can really help their customers connect with the brand more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YvwvS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have an interesting intersection of problems. There’s chargebacks and shipping fees and stuff that is very much in the physical world, and then you have the same set of digital problems as every platform, which is you have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fposhmark.com%2Fprohibited_items_policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22356854%2Fposhmark-retail-future-tracy-sun-community" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a content policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. People can post fake listings of things that are against the rules, like misrepresenting, I’m reading here, misrepresenting Native American, or American Indian arts and crafts. How do you think about making a content policy for, not a store, but a platform that enables stores?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0k60uz"&gt;So when we think about content moderation or any other topic, we really start from a place where we’re committed to ensuring that our marketplace reflects our values and the values of the community we serve. And we start from that place. And as we’ve scaled our content moderation, strategy is something we put a lot of time and energy into, as you’re alluding to. The first thing we do is we really harness the power of our community to help us. It’s a growing problem, and as you grow, it grows. So what we do is we enable our community to flag any items that they think might violate our policies or our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeFt8x"&gt;And then we have a team that monitors those flags and resolves them. So it’s a three-prong approach. It’s community, we have a team, and the third, which is the place we’re innovating the most, is really seeing how technology can help us. So we’re using machine learning and rules-based detection algorithms that help to go out into our marketplace and proactively identify anything that might be suspicious, or in violation of our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLl1iT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hear a lot about machine learning and AI-driven moderation. Have you had good results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCz9in"&gt;We have had good results in that they are helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WDR5Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Laughs] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a very politick answer there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoXO5p"&gt;Well, it’s true. We’re finding things, right? We’re finding things we might not have found before. And so it’s enough of a positive result for us to say, we need to continue this work, and we need to invest. And what we’re seeing is the smarter we get, the smarter other people get. And so you have to be committed to really fighting this battle in order to stand a chance, and so we have to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHfWQf"&gt;What we’re seeing is that if we don’t pay attention to this, it can really, like I said, it’s a violation of our values. And that’s the most important thing is to create this safe place where people can connect and transact. So yes, we’re very focused on it, it’s working, but by no means does it mean that, oh, it’s working, we can stop investing. We have to continue to invest in this area, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sX0Igj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this something you’re building? Is there an ecosystem of vendors that are working on it? When I hear about, particularly, computerized solutions to content moderation, it seems like every company trying to build their own is actually the wrong approach because the necessary rate of improvement is such that a handful of specialized firms would get there a lot faster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO5Y1h"&gt;Yeah. Yeah. We do both. We do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtECA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the more interesting debates that I’ve read about platforms like Poshmark and others is around the ethics of thrifting for resale. Most people have done it. Arbitrage is just a part of the world economy forever. Platforms like Poshmark enable you to buy out all the good stuff at a local thrift shop and then sell it for profit at a massive scale. Do you think that poses any issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3Z0zL"&gt;When I think about thrifting, to me, that’s a very positive consumer behavior. I love how shoppers are embracing secondhand, in that we are spending more time thinking about sustainable choices. And the more we can do that, I think it’s better to not waste what’s out there and to continue to value what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3k1WVu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the physicality of it is you’ve got a thrift store in a local community, and then you’re going to redistribute all the stuff out of that local thrift store across the United States, across Australia. Do you see that digital scale applied to a local community as a net positive or a negative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPw8Zb"&gt;Yeah, I think it’s a net positive to be able to support a local thrift store and to go in and provide liquidity for something that is not currently being used. And so as things distribute from a physical store to online distribution, I think it would be really interesting to think through how we can evolve as a system to see it as a positive to increase distribution, and finding homes for items is a net positive end result. So the more we can innovate and help everyone thrive in that type of system, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSrzCT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you thought about working with thrift stores, Goodwill, things like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SzdAO"&gt;We have. In fact, we worked with Goodwill last year and during the pandemic, they helped distribute boxes from their physical store, they actually came to us and said, “How do I bring my stuff online to your sellers?” So we helped them distribute their product to the Poshmark community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1amwOq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can’t end without asking you some pandemic fashion trends, which I’m very curious about, right? You run an e-commerce platform. We’ve obviously seen a huge surge in e-commerce during the pandemic. I’m hopeful that we’re at the finish line. There seems to be a lot of light at the end of this tunnel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdYbmb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have people been buying and selling more fashion during the pandemic? Is that something you’ve seen, or are they just transacting more in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF5gvI"&gt;I don’t love the fact that we’ve gone through a pandemic, but I am a bit of a data junkie and I started my career in data and in neuroscience, like how does data show human behavior? And so this is such a fascinating topic because we did see shifts in our data based on what everyone was going through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW4E8j"&gt;And we’re commerce, right, so we didn’t really see the data of everything that’s going on, but we did see how, at least, this pandemic changed the way people are shopping. So, some trends that we saw: We saw a decline in luxury shoes and handbags. Everything makes sense, right? We saw a decline in dresses. We saw an astronomical increase in home goods and athleisure, and oddly, jewelry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJniWC"&gt;And I attribute that to Zoom, it’s like, you want earrings. We also saw some strengthening of brands that are already popular, but became more popular. So I’m talking about, for women, Lululemon; for men, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/nike/373"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/adidas/522"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;. So, that was a lot of the pandemic stuff. I think what’s really interesting is now we’re getting into a phase where the data’s changing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6fXpY"&gt;And so what do I mean by that? We’re seeing searches go up for summer dresses and jean shorts. And to me, that’s not athleisure, right? That’s not “I’m hunkering down” type of consumer behavior. That’s a bit more optimistic. That’s like, “I might be able to go to a beach this summer, so I want bathing suits. I want dresses because I might be able to be much more social again.” And so what I’m reading into the data, it’s just a lot of optimism in our shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MogDFv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think post-quarantine fashion looks like? I have this dream that it will be super futuristic. Everyone’s going to be wearing space suits. But what does your data tell you that post-quarantine fashion looks like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLkI6L"&gt;Our data does not predict that &lt;em&gt;[Laughs]. &lt;/em&gt;I can conjecture, not from data, that just like anything else in our daily life, the post-pandemic world is going to look nothing like the pre-pandemic world, and it’s going to look nothing like the pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEsvMH"&gt;There’s going to be some sort of weird hybrid of both. It’s such an interesting time, a year plus of, I don’t even know what to call it, like a complete upside down. Everything got changed to the point where I don’t think things are going to go back, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="51dBR4"&gt;The shift to online that was already happening and exploded during the pandemic, it’s not going to go back. Some sort of hybrid is going to happen, and this is where innovation is really possible.&lt;/p&gt;
