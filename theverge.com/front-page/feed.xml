    <title>Latest leaks indicate new iPhones may have always-on displays like Apple’s Watch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R1XMX5"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman says the 2021 iPhone may have an always-on display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"&gt;similar to Apple’s Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and which Android phones have had for some time. Gurman wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;Power On newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that the phones will have improved battery life, a smaller notch on the screen, better video recording, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a faster A15 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7WmVs"&gt;It isn’t the first time a leak has suggested Apple is working on always-on screens for upcoming iPhones. Leaker Max Weinbach hinted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg&amp;amp;ab_channel=EverythingAppleProEAP"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may use the same kind of low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that its Watches have on future iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYvGYi"&gt;That’s in keeping with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting that “at least one” of the four new iPhones will include an LTPO display. The technology dynamically adjusts Watches’ screen refresh rates to conserve battery life. Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; also said earlier this year that the Pro iPhones coming this year would have LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIFGFl"&gt;In addition to the possibility of always-on iPhone screens, Gurman reported that Apple will likely announce new MacBook Pros this fall, “between September and November at the latest.” The computers will begin production in the third quarter, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pegasus spyware used to target phones of journalists and activists, investigation finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mnXcqYLtop5iYJ5X4w-_uNJHloE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597977/acastro_180109_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5P0OF"&gt;A sweeping investigation by 17 media outlets found that NSO Group’s Pegasus software was used in hacking attempts on 37 smartphones belonging to human rights activists and journalists, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; The phones were on a leaked list of numbers discovered by Paris journalism nonprofit Hidden Stories and human rights group Amnesty International, according to the Post. The numbers on the list were singled out for possible surveillance by countries who are clients of NSO, the report states, which markets its spyware to governments to track potential terrorists and criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVnXwL"&gt;Pegasus can extract all of a mobile device’s data, and activate the device’s microphone to listen in on conversations surreptitiously, as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/ft-editor-roula-khalaf-among-180-journalists-targeted-nso-spywarer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;notes. The list of journalists dates back to 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports, and includes reporters from the &lt;em&gt;Post, CNN&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Voice of America,&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUl5zO"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday, an NSO spokesperson denied the claims in the report, saying it was “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the reliability and interests of the sources,” and questioned the sources that supplied the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cfhet"&gt;“After checking their claims, we firmly deny the false allegations made in their report,” the statement continues. The company is considering a defamation lawsuit according to its statement, because it says “these allegations are so outrageous and far from reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBdhTP"&gt;It’s not the first time NSO’s Pegasus spyware has been accused of being part of a larger surveillance campaign. Between July and August 2020, research organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22192922/al-jazeera-journalists-hack-nso-group-hack-ios-imessage-zero-click-day"&gt;Citizen Lab found that 36 phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists&lt;/a&gt; had been hacked using Pegasus technology, possibly by hackers working for governments in the Middle East. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp sued NSO&lt;/a&gt;, claiming Pegasus was used to hack users of WhatsApp’s encrypted chat service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pushes back against Biden remarks on COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnOzlsd01mnbvPa0prbsSyyJNj0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69596112/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fI3bse"&gt;Facebook continued its pushback Saturday against President Biden’s comment that social media &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;platforms were “killing people”&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 misinformation, in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/"&gt;blog post from its vice president of integrity Guy Rosen&lt;/a&gt;. The post states that the “facts tell a very different story to the one promoted by the administration in recent days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWrarp"&gt;“At a time when COVID-19 cases are rising in America, the Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,” Rosen wrote. “While social media plays an important role in society, it is clear that we need a whole of society approach to end this pandemic. And facts — not allegations — should help inform that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyDP8V"&gt;(The post was titled “Moving Past the Finger Pointing: Support for COVID-19 vaccines is high on Facebook and growing.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZPEeB"&gt;On Friday, &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Peter Alexander asked Biden what his message was “to platforms like Facebook.” The president replied: “they’re killing people ...  the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.” See the exchange below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bDOvKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NBC's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PeterAlexander&lt;/a&gt;: "What's your message to platforms like Facebook [regarding COVID misinformation]?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Biden: "They're killing people." &lt;a href="https://t.co/TIaoeESMdk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TIaoeESMdk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Recount (@therecount) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1416118730904510467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rZOqO7"&gt;According to Rosen’s post, Facebook has worked with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Maryland on a &lt;a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/"&gt;global survey &lt;/a&gt;on COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and vaccination rates. The results, Rosen writes, show 85 percent of Facebook users in the US have or want to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. “President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,” Rosen added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKLSi9"&gt;Biden’s comment came amid growing pressure from the White House toward Facebook and other social platforms to better stem the flow of coronavirus vaccine misinformation on their sites. A Thursday report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt; on “confronting health information,” included recommendations for different stakeholders, including tech platforms, individuals, educators, health professionals, funders, researchers, journalists, and governments. The recommendations for the platforms included suggestions to “strengthen the monitoring of misinformation,” and “amplify communications from trusted messengers and subject matter experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNR5Af"&gt;In Saturday’s post, Rosen argued that Facebook had already taken action on &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;Murthy’s recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42FxY6"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said Friday that the “accusations” weren’t supported by the facts. Several Republicans also expressed concern about the White House’s efforts; Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) said the White House was “colluding with Facebook to censor Americans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf8S1q"&gt;In response to a request for comment, a White House spokesperson pointed to Murthy’s &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6264177467001#sp=show-clips"&gt;comments on &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;This isn’t about me or about a specific social media company, this is about the health of Americans. And the reality is that misinformation is still spreading like wildfire in our country, aided and abetted by technology platforms,” Murthy said, acknowledging that some technology companies have “taken positive steps,” but it’s not enough. “Despite some of the actions they have taken, we’re still seeing significant spreading of misinformation,” on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTtP0o"&gt;“I’m asking these companies to step up and take responsibility for what’s happening on their sites,” Murthy added. “I’m asking them to look out for the people all across this country whose lives depend on having access to accurate information. And that’s what I’m going to continue to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO8mmW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 18th 11:59AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds Sunday comments from Vivek Murthy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robot collision at Ocado warehouse near London sparks fire, delaying customer orders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrTYWaH8Mhc57aexSbPmQDT1hO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597620/jvincent_180501_2547_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exm3I3"&gt;Online-only British supermarket Ocado has had to cancel some customers’ delivery orders after a Friday robot collision at one of its warehouses caused a fire, &lt;a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/response-to-fire-at-erith"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFYc48"&gt;The fire at the company’s Erith warehouse east of London “appears to have been caused by the collision of three bots on the grid,” the company said in a statement on Sunday. No one was injured, and the damage was limited to less than 1 percent of its grid, according to Ocado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H77UFb"&gt;The grocer’s warehouses are populated with washing machine-sized robots that move products around on a grid system. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s James Vincent wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17331250/automated-warehouses-jobs-ocado-andover-amazon"&gt;Ocado’s plans in a 2018 feature&lt;/a&gt; story. He described the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o6LiSQ"&gt;Deliveries are unpacked into crates; crates are placed onto conveyors; and conveyors carry the crates to shelves, where human “pickers” take what they need to fill customers’ orders. The new paradigm, though, is all about using space as efficiently as possible. Items are still placed in crates, but those crates are now stored in huge stacks, up to 17 boxes high. Their position in this stack seems to be at random — a box of razors next to cod fillets, for example — but it’s algorithmically decided; with frequently accessed items placed on the top and rarer purchases near the bottom. On top of this hoard, the robots do their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCU2Vm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="This is an automated warehouse for groceries|38290" data-volume-uuid="cd275e54f" data-volume-id="38290" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-829" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Robots at Ocado’s warehouses operate on grids. Three of the robots collided at its Erith warehouse on July 16th, causing a fire that has disrupted operations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7UDc0"&gt;The company said Sunday that the Erith plant, which processes some 150,000 orders a week &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aaddf4b1-a78b-4289-b42f-fd3f5cd7f176"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, should restart operations in the next few days. “While we expect some disruption to operations, we are working to restore normal service as soon as possible,” the company said. “We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the Steam Deck won’t flop like Valve’s Steam Machines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rO0ya_tzfUSzL0F84ZKOm3nPb5E=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597325/steam_deck_hades.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ELWr7O"&gt;You’re not having deja vu. Six years after launching a line of Linux game consoles that went down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;as one of the biggest tech flops of the past decade&lt;/a&gt;, Valve is trying once again. Only this time, its Steam Machine dreams and unusual touchpads have been rolled into a 7-inch handheld PC that looks and works like a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4RczI"&gt;It’s called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read all about its specs, extensive controls and TV docking station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vO2c2z"&gt;I’m not deluding myself into thinking it’s a Switch-killer. (Even if the Steam Deck’s $399 starting price might seem close to Nintendo’s $350 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Switch with OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, you’re not getting Mario, Zelda and Metroid on a Steam Deck.) But having watched Valve closely over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/2/2840932/exclusive-valve-steam-box-gaming-console"&gt;past nine years&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t believe it will flop like the Steam Machines either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRaAxn"&gt;Here are six reasons why this isn’t Steam Machines all over again — and, a few brand-new reasons to be skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="G8dGvV"&gt;1: Valve is building the hardware itself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSyiy"&gt;There are plenty of reasons why Valve’s Steam Machines failed, but one towers over the rest: Valve was never in control of its own hardware destiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LF44U"&gt;When we exclusively revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming"&gt;Gabe Newell’s plans for the “Steam Box” in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, he originally explained that Valve would sell its own Linux-based living room PC, while simultaneously creating an ecosystem where partners would deliver a wide array of good/better/best boxes as well, creating an entire new category of gaming PC. &lt;br&gt;But Valve’s own box didn’t make it to market. It never broadly sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future"&gt;the impressive prototype it demonstrated for us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in November 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo: Steam Controller and Steam Machine press pictures" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHVvCQWVZhrnvZ3dfy2FNxGPOuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12803513/STEAM_M_console_controller_hero.1419980053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You couldn’t really buy the original Steam Machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ySqryz"&gt;Somewhere along the line, Valve decided to leave the vast majority of the hardware to existing PC manufacturers, whose Steam OS offerings were a mess, running the gamut from “it’s our Windows box, but with fewer games because it’s running Linux” to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4089864/xi3-piston-steam-box-pre-orders-open"&gt;dubious designs Valve wound up disavowing&lt;/a&gt;. Alienware was one of the few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream"&gt;to build a bespoke Steam Machine&lt;/a&gt;, but it wound up running Windows first instead — because Valve and its hodgepodge collection of partners didn’t manage to launch the Steam Machines initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch"&gt;until November 2015&lt;/a&gt;. By then, that Alienware Alpha had been on sale for nearly a year already.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzYBnk"&gt;But with the new Steam Deck, Valve is in control once again. We’re not getting a vague time frame for a grand plan to reshape the PC industry, but instead a specific piece of hardware with a specific release window in December 2021. And we have some faith in Valve’s hardware prowess, too, because the company has built up a reputation for excellence. While niche, the Steam Controller and Steam Link wireless box were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;incredibly smart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;well-designed products&lt;/a&gt; that deserved better than their eventual fire sales, and Valve set a extremely high bar for PC-tethered virtual reality headsets with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; and the co-developed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11358618/htc-vive-vr-review"&gt;HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JF0DuU"&gt;2: Linux is no longer a death sentence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BooAvm"&gt;In 2015, after years of reporting on their promises and possibilities, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;warned our readers not to preorder a Steam Machine&lt;/a&gt;. The reason had little to do with how long they’d been delayed, and everything to do with how Linux simply didn’t have enough games. We put together a chart of the top 50 games on Steam that made that clear — no &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V, Fallout or Skyrim, DayZ&lt;/em&gt; or any games that weren’t on Steam. Meanwhile, the PS4, Xbox One, and even Windows controller support were looking better and better all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zefr30"&gt;Today, it’s still the case that fewer than 15 percent of all Steam titles officially support SteamOS, but thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console"&gt;seeds that Valve planted&lt;/a&gt; with Linux nearly a decade ago, the company no longer has to convince developers to port their games from scratch. Many of the officially recognized 8,000 SteamOS titles work thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;a Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt; that lets Windows games run on Linux. Huge competitive shooters like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends, Destiny 2, PUBG &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; might soon be possible since Valve is working to get &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"&gt;their anti-cheat software working ahead of launch&lt;/a&gt;. If that happens, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/"&gt;most of the top games on Steam&lt;/a&gt; should be playable on SteamOS, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5CyR9C9Qm6UrHitttZ4oBzj9Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719886/Steam_Deck_touchscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UDNlLu"&gt;Perhaps just as importantly, the Steam Deck isn’t chained to Linux. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;Valve says you can install Windows if you like&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other publishers’ stores. And because it’s a PC, you could also fill in the gaming gaps with an array of streaming services like Microsoft xCloud, Google Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and others if you’re willing to pay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18274498/game-streaming-services-pc-mac-ps4-android-cloud-google-stadia"&gt;or stream games over your home network&lt;/a&gt; from your PlayStation, Xbox or another gaming PC. Good luck doing any of that on Nintendo’s portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="N27Hwm"&gt;3: Handheld gaming PCs are neat, and Deck might be the best yet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Okbv"&gt;With Steam Machines, it sometimes felt like Valve was trying to reinvent the wheel. That’s not the case here. Even though most everyone has a smartphone in their pocket these days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"&gt;video game handhelds are resurgent&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the Nintendo Switch and an array of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;inspiring concepts&lt;/a&gt; that followed in its wake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIZerW"&gt;The Steam Deck isn’t even the first gaming PC to get Switch-ified: we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;how we’re getting closer to a Nintendo Switch-sized gaming PC&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and for the past few months I’ve been playing with one of them, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22320306/aya-neo-handheld-gaming-pc-indiegogo-price-release-date-nintendo-switch"&gt;the crowdfunded Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to the Steam Deck in that it’s also AMD-powered with joysticks and buttons on both sides of a 7-inch, 1280 x 800 touchscreen. While it’s not powerful enough to competently run demanding games and the software’s a little janky, I played through the majority of &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt; and some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; on the go, and chatted with buddies on Discord while exploring the deadly plains of Valheim — where the handheld’s AMD Vega 6 graphics did tend to bog down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nAXJA9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JkCIILzfhmA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XCqZ7c"&gt;As YouTube gaming handheld expert Taki Udon &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkCIILzfhmA"&gt;will tell you&lt;/a&gt;, the build quality and ergonomics on these crowdfunded handhelds isn’t always that great, and that’s an opportunity for Valve to flex. Plus, existing handhelds typically cost $700 to $1000. Valve’s asking hundreds of dollars less for the Steam Deck, and with a newer GPU that might bring more games within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="UTCpoN"&gt;4: Valve is a game company again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="lHasBY"&gt;In 2020, thirteen years after the most infamous cliffhanger in video game history, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;made its triumphant return with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976066/half-life-alyx-trailer-release-date-news-steam-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a full-length VR-exclusive that quickly shot to the top of “best VR game” lists and reportedly gave the Valve Index headset a huge boost in sales. Ever since, Valve employees have repeatedly hinted that &lt;em&gt;Alyx &lt;/em&gt;made them excited about building single-player games again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XjAnMagr6hnw5u6hVlLDIkqu3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19395801/half_life_alyx_vr_007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="USmKQ4"&gt;Valve’s David Speyer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976012/half-life-alyx-valve-series-future"&gt;would “love to continue pushing forward”&lt;/a&gt; on new &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; games, and Gabe Newell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/22/22244057/valve-gabe-newell-half-life-new-zealand-game-development"&gt;told New Zealand’s &lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January that it has new single-player games in development. “It’s fun to ship games,” he said, adding that &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; “created a lot of momentum inside of the company to do more of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A08OJw"&gt;With the Steam Deck, Valve may now have an opportunity to use one of those games to jumpstart a platform yet again. If you’ll recall, that’s how the Steam platform made it off the ground in 2004 to begin with — it was the only place to play &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; and Valve’s subsequent games. But with Steam Machines, the company opted not to do it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future"&gt;telling me in 2013&lt;/a&gt; that “It’s against our philosophy to put a game in jail and say it only works on Steam Machines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG5VOL"&gt;That left Valve at the mercy of other developers for games, during an era when it didn’t make many new games of its own. It did bring the then-two-year-old &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;three-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; and four-year-old &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead 2&lt;/em&gt; to Linux in time for the platform’s debut, but there was no good gaming reason to pick a SteamOS box over Windows once the Steam Machines came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oIkwhS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Steam Deck is one and a HALF times wider than the Switch, has a battery LIFE of 2-8 hours, and sells for THREE hundred and ninety nine dollars.&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Bailey (@IBasteEvenly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IBasteEvenly/status/1416098661738627077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zfbxT"&gt;But Valve’s philosophy may have evolved. With virtual reality, Valve realized it needed to kickstart the platform, building an incredible showcase &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/htc-vive-valve-the-lab-steamvr-desktop-theater-mode-gdc-2016/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then adding system seller &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;last year, a game it justified keeping VR-exclusive because it was designed explicitly for VR immersion and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiCNue"&gt;I wouldn’t exactly bet on it, but I wouldn’t bet against the idea that Valve could make a similar argument for games that use the Deck’s precision touchpad, touchscreen, touch-sensitive thumbsticks, gyro and rear buttons to emulate the sensation of hands moving around and grabbing things. Valve could build a &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; exclusive to portables like this, if not exclusive to the Steam Deck itself. Most PCs certainly don’t have quite this array of input, and it might be a shame if the Deck’s extensive controls were limited to the kind of homegrown controller schemes that Steam Controller fans pump out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="91oMBf"&gt;5: Gaming dollars are burning a hole in people’s pockets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="I8Q3Mp"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck might be right on time. Due to the global pandemic, the world’s gamers are acutely aware of who they are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536084/video-games-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-among-us-animal-crossing"&gt;There’s never been a better time to play video games&lt;/a&gt;, and demand has never been higher, with US consumers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233003/us-npd-group-video-game-spending-2020-record-nintendo-switch-call-of-duty-animal-crossing-ps5-ps4"&gt;spending more in 2020&lt;/a&gt; than ever before. And while the PS5, Xbox Series X and an array of new PC gaming graphics cards are here, the global chip shortage means you still can’t easily buy them even now, as some of the world is coming out of that pandemic and thinking about leaving the house. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHCNCVFPUuaL8wIo6q1rIVjIWJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867820/twarren_200909_4184_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PLx1oJ"&gt;If you’ve held onto dollars earmarked for those consoles and graphics cards (either because you can’t get one, or are still unconvinced), you might now consider spending that money on a handheld that can accompany you out of the house. There, Nintendo is ready to tempt you with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;the shiny new OLED-equipped Switch&lt;/a&gt; that went on pre-order this past week, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;it didn’t announce a Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt;. That’s an opportunity for Valve to swoop in: forgetting the Nintendo games, the Steam Deck is about as pro a Switch as you’re liable to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oI1UOY"&gt;6: Valve can afford a hobby or two&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="hAH8bg"&gt;But even if the Steam Deck doesn’t attract gamers away from next-gen consoles or graphics cards, that doesn’t mean it’ll flop. So far, every piece of hardware Valve’s built is a gadget its own engineers wanted to see in the world, not a piece of mass-market kit. But if the Steam Deck winds up being a niche product that barely sells, it might still be a success for the company and fans. Some have grown to appreciate what Valve was trying to do with the Steam Controller, for instance, which has a loyal community pumping out custom control schemes for new games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;last I checked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qSFHk"&gt;The other important thing above Valve building its own hardware is that it can only hurt itself if it fails, and Valve can likely take the pain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413196/valve-steam-lawsuit-wolfire-games-humble-bundle-app-store-cut-epic-apple"&gt;According to a recent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Valve rakes in an estimated $6 billion in annual revenue from Steam commissions alone, incredible for a company its size, working out to something like $15 million per year per Valve employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vleWQ5"&gt;Besides, Valve seems to be taking a more cautious approach, with buyers putting down $5 deposits to reserve a device, limit 1 per customer, and Valve fulfilling those orders when they’re ready instead of letting a product “sell out.” (It’s incredible that Valve’s the first to try the common-sense approach to preorders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;we’ve been begging the game industry to adopt for many months&lt;/a&gt; with consoles and GPUs.) It might also allow Valve to fulfill orders in small batches instead of investing in a mountain of devices it might have to put on fire sale down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VmiZy5"&gt;Why the Deck might still get dunked on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zDwwFj"&gt;I highly doubt the Steam Deck will be a public flop, but I can imagine a few reasons the PC gaming community won’t wind up embracing it anyhow. For instance, it’s largely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578917/valve-steam-deck-nintendo-switch-xbox-series-x-ps5-spec-comparison"&gt;priced like a next-gen console with only a fraction of the performance&lt;/a&gt;, even if it winds up being more powerful than other handheld PCs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVKDm1"&gt;The $399 base model only comes with 64GB of eMMC flash, too, in an era when a single game can sometimes require more space than that, and when PS5 and Xbox Series X games are beginning to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;the faster load times that speedy NVMe solid state storage can afford&lt;/a&gt;. While you can add a microSD card to any model to expand your storage, the &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; of your storage might hold the system back some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9c4oyD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10656185"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YbQWV"&gt;Lastly, I’ve got to agree with some of my colleagues with more taste: this is not a &lt;em&gt;particularly &lt;/em&gt;good looking machine. It reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/7/3963056/wikipad-survives-reincarnated-as-7-inch-gaming-tablet-for-249-99"&gt;the bulbous Wikipad&lt;/a&gt; far more than it does a Nintendo Switch, with those thumbsticks mounted high like antennae sticking out of its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caxcrD"&gt;But I tried the Wikipad, and there’s a reason it was shaped like that: it was designed to be comfortable to hold, not necessarily pleasing for the eyes. I wonder if that’s the idea behind the Deck, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM9YIo"&gt;In case you’re wondering, I ordered one. We’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwHJOG0qh5NeRuIONYyBV-oDcs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597234/focus2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lilxvH"&gt;One of the most powerful new features in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, is Focus mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYYfJM"&gt;At its core, a Focus mode is a more customizable version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb and is accessed from the same menu on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. But Focus modes are far more customizable, allowing for more granular triggers for when you’re filtering out notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Pn8SJy"&gt;To set up a Focus, head over to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus” and hit the plus button to add a new Focus. You’ll also be able to see existing Focus modes that you’ve set up and edit them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="byicVU"&gt;Apple offers a variety of preset Focus modes to start with, including Personal, Work, Fitness, Gaming, Reading, and more.  You’re not limited to Apple’s preset suggestions, though some of the presets — like the Driving, Fitness, or Gaming ones — offer additional features and triggers that aren’t available to user-created ones. Apple’s Fitness Focus mode, for example, can be automatically triggered when you start a Fitness Plus workout on your Apple Watch, while the Gaming mode can turn on whenever you connect a Bluetooth controller. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSdC6b"&gt;You can create a custom Focus by selecting Custom, which will let you select a name, icon, and color for that specific focus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0rJ922zkJK1HYgkTYRVlTUEmOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722624/IMG_2971.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting allowed contacts on a Focus mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWlkT3UZMVR9mthWICQ3aFHl_fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722625/IMG_2972.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selecting which apps can send notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RbG2hC"&gt;Next, you’ll be asked to choose which of your contacts (if any) you’d like to be able to message you when that Focus mode is activated — similar to how Do Not Disturb works. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ObuqH7"&gt;The following screen will ask you to select which apps (if any) you want to allow to send notifications when that Focus is active. For example, if you’re making a “Work” Focus, you might only want your email and Slack apps to be able to send you pings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRv3Ws"&gt;Lastly, Apple will ask if you’d like to be able to receive special “Time Sensitive Notifications” — a new category of extra-important notifications that apps will be able to send that might not be able to wait until later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68bOT1HEw2UNEI4aqXAgv3iyaiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722626/IMG_2973.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle to permit time-sensitive notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6MgwY"&gt;Once you’ve finished setting up your Focus, you’ll end up on the Focus mode’s setting menu, where there are a few additional things you’ll be able to configure. You can also get back here at any time by heading to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus,” then selecting the Focus mode you want to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="51dh4u"&gt;The Focus Status menu will let you decide whether contacts will see a notice if you’re in an active Focus mode and their messages are muted. (Although right now, the only app that supports the feature is Apple’s Messages.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nui0Ov"&gt;The Home Screen menu allows you to hide specific home screens on your iPad or iPhone when you’re in a Focus mode. Combined with iOS 15’s App Library and the new ability to create multiple copies of an app icon, you can use this feature to customize what your phone looks like in different situations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R131dW"&gt;The Lock Screen menu offers the option to show or hide silenced notifications on the lock screen or to dim the lock screen when the Focus mode is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtJkCFe6sjUa3VlDU2CZcQ0E1Bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722631/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_springboard_focus_060721.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="83ZphP"&gt;Finally, there’s the actual activation of a Focus mode. Apple offers two ways to turn on a Focus mode: you can either manually select it from the moon icon in Control Center or schedule it automatically (settings for which can be found in the Focus menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akxno0"&gt;The simplest option is “Smart Activation,” which has your device automatically toggle a Focus on its own. But you can also add more granular manual controls, activating a Focus for specific times, when you’re at a specific location, or when you’re using specific apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is getting hauled into court for not recalling dangerous products the right way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdVYUs8LwKVQIOJrSRAC83bDank=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69596007/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VzV9S"&gt;Since 2019, Amazon has sold nearly 400,000 hair dryers that could shock someone if they fell into a pool of water, 24,000 carbon monoxide detectors that didn’t actually detect carbon monoxide, and an unspecified number of “children’s sleepwear garments” that didn’t meet flammability requirements, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0knewx"&gt;Now, the US safety regulator wants to force Amazon to recall those products. This past week, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Sues-Amazon-to-Force-Recall-of-Hazardous-Products-Sold-on-Amazon-com"&gt;it sued the company&lt;/a&gt; in a case that could be the latest to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414185/california-appeals-court-amazon-marketplace-responsible-third-party-hoverboard"&gt;hold Amazon accountable for products offered by its third-party sellers&lt;/a&gt;. But here’s the thing: Amazon has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; recalled these specific products. They’re no longer for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG9VGa"&gt;Amazon says, and the CPSC acknowledges, that the giant retailer has already stopped selling these products, already notified their buyers, and already handed out refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbx1Nl"&gt;Here’s the initial statement Amazon provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="de7pbB"&gt;Customer safety is a top priority and we take prompt action to protect customers when we are aware of a safety concern. As the CPSC’s own complaint acknowledges, for the vast majority of the products in question, Amazon already immediately removed the products from our store, notified customers about potential safety concerns, advised customers to destroy the products, and provided customers with full refunds. For the remaining few products in question, the CPSC did not provide Amazon with enough information for us to take action and despite our requests, CPSC has remained unresponsive. Amazon has an industry-leading recalls program and we have further offered to expand our capabilities to handle recalls for all products sold in our store, regardless of whether those products were sold or fulfilled by Amazon or third-party sellers. We are unclear as to why the CPSC has rejected that offer or why they have filed a complaint seeking to force us to take actions almost entirely duplicative of those we’ve already taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WtTw2j"&gt;What’s actually going on here? We spoke to the CPSC, and it claims there’s a few big problems with the way Amazon’s handling the issue. Primarily, that the CPSC would have to take Amazon’s word that the recall is being handled and that these dangerous products are actually being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUhHU9"&gt;In the statement, Amazon says that the CPSC rejected its offer to work together on this issue, and it seems like that might be true — because Amazon’s offer was a “proposed recalls pledge” that would let online marketplaces handle recalls themselves. Here’s the proposal Amazon sent the CPSC on May 6th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCYCtv"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21010448-amazon-cpsc-letter-to-commissioners-signed/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Amazon - CPSC Letter to Commissioners Signed (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nTDtyQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk0g9M"&gt;The CPSC originally suggested to us that pledge wasn’t a legally binding agreement, either — it might have to take Amazon’s word that it would, for instance, provide regular reports about the progress of a recall so the CPSC can follow up. If Amazon didn’t adequately tell customers how to destroy dangerous products or how to ship them back at no charge, the CPSC might not be able to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3PNVF"&gt;Amazon suggests that’s not true, though.  “Amazon proposed an agreement that would be legally binding, and that was developed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff,” it tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The retailer says it worked “hand-in-hand” with the CPSC through this entire process, used a recall template that “we discussed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff,” and suggests it doesn’t understand why the CPSC changed its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwp5G2"&gt;Neither Amazon nor the CPSC would let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;see a copy of their proposed agreement, but Amazon did give us copies of the recall notices it sent to customers. One example:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V38zghj_YOppLXPSYd14gJTAGs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22723831/amazon_notice_recall.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="esjW1q"&gt;Amazon says there’s a simple reason you don’t see any mention of returns: “Amazon did not require the return of these products before issuing a refund because CPSC had not asked us to and because such a step is unusual for recalls of these product types,” Amazon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRIgAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s about the long game, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDKl4o"&gt;There are bigger things at stake than the recalls of these specific products, though. CPSC’s move is also about finding the authority to force recalls on broad online seller marketplaces like Amazon to begin with, marketplaces which weren’t around at the time the laws were written — that way, it wouldn’t always need to rely on Amazon being willing to comply. CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler hints at this difficulty in a statement (&lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/Statement%20on%20Amazon%20RSA%207.14.pdf?1yhJvJ7Pp5JRVCX2qW1UYJ7td8nId6dA"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) issued alongside the complaint: “for every product which CPSC determines a recall is necessary, a lengthy negotiation must first take place about the threshold question of whether that sales platform is even subject to our laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXQqVB"&gt;The CPSC says its existing statute gives it legal authority when it comes to importers, distributors and manufacturers, and it’s now arguing the way Amazon handles its “Fulfilled by Amazon” products clearly makes it a distributor under the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Nzq4"&gt;“We are seeking Amazon to be responsible for the ‘fulfilled by Amazon’ products on their site; Amazon does not see themselves legally responsible for these products. We assert Amazon has legal responsibility as a distributor for the safety of these products,” the CPSC tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding “We are eager to collaborate with them on details of a recall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl0B97"&gt;Amazon, of course, doesn’t want to be categorized as a distributor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="llM27S"&gt;We disagree with CPSC’s assertion that we are a distributor under this statute, and our perspective was reinforced by Chairman Adler’s statement. However, more importantly, Amazon has always believed that we have an obligation to our customers to provide the safest shopping experience. This is why Amazon has messaged customers and covered the cost of refunds when selling partners failed to engage with regulators about recalls. We did this for the products noted in the lawsuit, and worked with CPSC staff to finalize an agreement that would establish a new-norm for recalls of third-party products. We are unclear as to why the CPSC Commission rejected that offer, particularly as its staff worked hand-in-hand with us to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2mtAKT"&gt;If this does get dragged out in the courts, the CPSC says it might take many years to conclude, with previous forced recalls taking five to seven years on average. The first step is getting the case in front of an administrative law judge (of which the CPSC says it doesn’t have any of its own), after which Amazon may have several opportunities to appeal, first to the CPSC itself and then in the federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzZqnF"&gt;You can read the CPSC’s full complaint against Amazon below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TurboTax parent company Intuit is exiting the IRS Free File Program </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;TurboTax parent company Intuit has opted out of the IRS Free File Program.  | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVaA6T"&gt;Intuit, the parent company of tax filing software TurboTax, is exiting an IRS program that allows many Americans to file their taxes for free. The IRS partners with the &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/"&gt;Free File Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit coalition of tax software &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/free-file-alliance-members/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; that offer no-cost tax filing services for the Free File program. &lt;a href="https://www.intuit.com/blog/news-social/accelerating-technology-innovation-to-better-help-consumers-solve-their-most-pressing-financial-problems/"&gt;Intuit says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on its website that part of the reason it’s leaving Free File— which is available to 2020 filers with &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/faq/"&gt;adjusted gross income of $72,000&lt;/a&gt; or less— is the “restraints” of the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImC846"&gt;“With the Free File program surpassing its founding goals of e-file and free tax preparation, and due to the limitations of the Free File program and conflicting demands from those outside the program, we are not able to continue in the program and deliver all of the benefits that can help consumers make more money, save more, and invest for the future,” according to the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7TRPO"&gt;Readers may recall that a series of &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap"&gt;reports by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block had misled filers into paying to file their taxes. The companies kept the free versions of their software from &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"&gt;showing up in search engine results&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;, making them harder to find online. The IRS later &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-reforms-free-file-program-drops-agreement-not-to-compete-with-turbotax"&gt;overhauled the Free File&lt;/a&gt; program, removing a provision in the agreement that prohibited the agency from creating an online filing system of its own that would compete with the software companies’ products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NhS7O"&gt;Intuit’s blog post says the company will leave the Free File program at the end of the tax season in October because it wants to “provide more financial benefits and empower Americans of all income levels to take control of their finances.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1cmZA"&gt;Intuit closed on an acquisition of credit score monitoring company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150609/turbo-tax-credit-karma-intuit-purchase-competitor-credit-checks"&gt;Credit Karma for $7.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020. The deal drew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353085/turbotax-intuit-credit-karma-purchase-tax-preparation-services-doj-antitrust"&gt;scrutiny from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, which was concerned about potential antitrust issues; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/free-credit-karma-tax-service-now-available-for-2017-tax-filing-season-300394430.html"&gt;Credit Karma started offering&lt;/a&gt; its own version of free tax filing in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHldYs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Full Self Driving subscriptions are now available for $199 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYVW4sogGnQQahqgq6OV5XBU0oc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595351/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Stnrxd"&gt;Tesla has started offering a monthly subscription for its Full Self Driving package for $199 per month (h/t &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Tesla owners who bought the since-discontinued Enhanced Autopilot package can get the FSD subscription for $99 per month, according to &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/full-self-driving-subscriptions#pricing"&gt;Tesla’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. Until now the automaker had sold its FSD package for a one-time fee of $10,000, but the monthly subscription lets users test-drive (literally) the FSD features without a long-term commitment. Tesla owners can cancel their monthly FSD subscription at any time, according to the terms on the Tesla website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zcJmd"&gt;Only Teslas that have the FSD computer hardware 3.0 (HW3) or above plus either Basic or Enhanced Autopilot configurations are eligible to subscribe to FSD; other owners can purchase a hardware upgrade for $1,500 to make their vehicles FSD-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYBPHb"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been promising a subscription option for FSD for a few years now. Tesla finally began sending out over-the-air software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;updates for the beta &lt;/a&gt;of version 9 of FSD earlier this month. As a reminder, the FSD software does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6raEyG"&gt;An owner shared a notice they had &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/17/tesla-debuts-fsd-subscription-for-199-per-month.html"&gt;received from Tesla with CNBC,&lt;/a&gt; which said the FSD subscription included “features like Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, Auto Park, Summon and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control.” The notice also stated that “the currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoMAq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4rGTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The space tourism industry is stuck in its billionaire phase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORRyEpax417RGqs960dim3-LRYE=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595156/1233924109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The spectacle of launching billionaires into space is the beginning of a long road ahead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vrEatA"&gt;Richard Branson’s extravagant jaunt to space on Sunday signaled the dawning of a new space age — for the few people that can afford it. Jeff Bezos is about to set off on a similar excursion next Tuesday when he launches to space with three others on his company Blue Origin’s first crewed flight. The two billionaires are validating their companies’ tourist-tailored rockets and, they say, fulfilling lifelong dreams to get a brief taste of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gadMYr"&gt;But what Virgin Galactic’s mission on Sunday proved, and what Bezos’ flight will similarly show, is that space is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; open, not for you and me or the general public, but for more billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKPATX"&gt;Opening up the cosmos to the masses and normalizing space travel is a goal companies and their billionaire backers have been targeting for years but haven’t yet achieved. There’s economic potential beyond launching rich people to space: microgravity research for scientists and — a much farther goal — rapid transportation between continents. That’s the vision they’re selling with these flashy flights; once exclusive to government astronauts, traveling in space could be a thing for everyone else too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GxDUFa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s tough at the beginning”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmAnQD"&gt;“That’s the dream, right? That space isn’t just for NASA anymore,” Kathy Lueders, NASA’s human spaceflight chief who oversaw development of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon astronaut capsule, said during a press conference in April. “I mean, I think that’s what we’re trying to do... what we were hoping is that you would hopefully have so many customers that at one point, the price-point would go down to having it be accessible. It’s tough at the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbxheo"&gt;In this beginning phase, flying to space is priced only for the ultra-rich, driven by the high costs of new space technology. Virgin Galactic’s launch of Richard Branson represented one of the final key test missions to validate its shiny six-seated spaceplane, SpaceShipTwo, but it was also a meticulously crafted marketing event, complete with flashy promo videos, inspirational speeches, and a pop concert, all designed to help attract more attention, and more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDS62AonRrv1yp2jGNvC5AixrX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22723074/1233922260.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Guests of Virgin Galactic at Spaceport America watch as Richard Branson’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane takes off under its carrier plane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7bdbNw"&gt;To live their own version of Branson’s dream, customers will have to pay at least $250,000 for a seat (the company already has roughly 600 booked passengers). And right now, the quarter-million-dollar price tag is the cheapest option on the market. The price for a seat on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket could be higher. And if you want to go into orbit for a few days, a ride on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will set you back at least $55 million (that could be higher too; SpaceX hasn’t publicly confirmed the real price).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Er8MBD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A long road ahead to bringing prices down&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jYErR7"&gt;While Branson and Bezos’ flights to space mark key moments for their space tourism businesses, the space industry is far from being able to offer its services to the rest of the public. To get there, they’ll have to clear several hurdles: Can these rockets reliably fly humans on multiple missions without a hitch? If there is a hitch, like a fatal accident, can the market survive a damaged reputation? And can someone buy a ticket to space just as they can book an expensive flight (instead of just the ultra-rich)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqwsY0"&gt;Then there’s the court of public opinion, which may be difficult to win over. Bezos, Branson and Elon Musk’s space ambitions have been criticized as another example of billionaires spending money on passion projects when there are places and causes where those funds could arguably be put to better use. The US alone struggles with vast wealth inequities, poor access to healthcare and a rapidly changing climate, among other problems that, when paired with space tourism, makes the activity look insultingly selfish to many. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a leading critic of billionaires, has repeated that point as the private space race heats up. “Here on Earth, in the richest country on the planet, half our people live paycheck to paycheck, people are struggling to feed themselves, struggling to see a doctor — but hey, the richest guys in the world are off in outer space!,” he tweeted in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t5E5Am"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here on Earth, in the richest country on the planet, half our people live paycheck to paycheck, people are struggling to feed themselves, struggling to see a doctor — but hey, the richest guys in the world are off in outer space! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I9sAKg"&gt;“I can understand it,” Branson says of critiques like Sen. Sanders’, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgN4Oh156A&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheLateShowwithStephenColbert"&gt;speaking on &lt;em&gt;The Late Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Stephen Colbert on July 14th. “But I think maybe they’re not fully educated as to what space does for Earth.” Branson, like other space advocates, point to the technologies that investments in space have helped propel into the mainstream, like the GPS capabilities wired into smartphones, weather tracking services or climate change research and modeling from satellites in low-Earth orbit. Many of those investments came from public funds — it’s still unclear what spin-off developments might emerge from the still-fledgling private space tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EAnhXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to deal with the fact that billionaires trying to make more money are the public face of the space sector right now”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xK0kCl"&gt;As long as the space industry is dependent on billionaire funds for spacecraft built for billionaire (and millionaire) customers, the perception that this is a hobby for the ultrawealthy will inevitably remain. “We have to deal with the fact that billionaires trying to make more money are the public face of the space sector right now,” Brian Weeden, a director at the Secure World Foundation, said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUOXe"&gt;Putting faces on nascent industries isn’t unusual in itself. Charles Lindbergh, the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean alone, famously helped propel commercial aviation from its infancy in the 1920s and 1930s. Same with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates at the dawn of the desktop computer at the end of the 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCOsJk"&gt;Those industries, too, had doubters and critics. The US was skeptical of the early planes being built by the Wright brothers and top military officials dismissed aviation as a fad. “Any man who sticks to it is either crazy or else a plain damned fool,” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Admiral_William_A_Moffett/k5uOBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=Rear+Admiral+%22William+A.+Moffett%22+%22damned+fool%22&amp;amp;pg=PA40&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; American Admiral William A. Moffett, who would later embrace aviation under the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics. And in 1943, when computers were massive room-sized objects, the chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson, &lt;a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1059.htm"&gt;scoffed&lt;/a&gt; at their potential: “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xc61oj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A fairly large learning curve” from development to routine operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A5d665"&gt;Flights became commonplace. Computers became less expensive and more widely used. And at each phase of the computer’s evolution, people found new ways to use them as they became accessible to more markets and a wider swath of consumers, notes Carissa Christensen, CEO of BryceTech, a tech and space industry analytics firm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4LxKHSsaam1Lr-EIU2AtRov63I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477954/665033922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos introduces Blue Origin’s New Shepard system in 2017&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ePAyj9"&gt;“There’s going to be a fairly large learning curve as companies go from the process of developing a capability and testing it, to operating it routinely,” Christensen said. It’s possible that space tourism will follow the same path as computers or airplanes, but there’s no guarantee that it will succeed. In part, that’s because there’s no single solution to driving down the cost of launching people to space. Virgin Galactic earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356889/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-iii-three-3"&gt;unveiled a new version of SpaceShipTwo&lt;/a&gt; that’s tailored for quick production rates, signaling it’s gearing up to accommodate its hefty customer backlog and reopen ticket sales, which have been closed since a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7139527/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-suffers-anomaly-in-flight"&gt;fatal 2014 accident&lt;/a&gt; during a test flight. (Branson’s presence on Sunday’s flight also served as a visual reassurance to customers that the ship is safe.)  Musk is focusing on better rocket fuel efficiency with SpaceX’s Starship, a fully reusable launch system being developed to slash the cost of sending humans to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b1o8E"&gt;But again, what &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;those next-generation prices will be remain a mystery. Musk hasn’t said how much it’ll cost prospective passengers to fly on Starship. And Virgin Galactic hasn’t said how much it plans to charge for tickets for its newer spaceplane, SpaceShipThree, just like Blue Origin, which hasn’t revealed its New Shepard prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="muh0wT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keeping space tourism dreams alive while the price comes down&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bomuFZ"&gt;Currently, you either have to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;talented (hand-picked by a billionaire)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;lucky&lt;/a&gt; to book a ride on one of these rockets without paying the steep price tag. Raffling off tickets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572643/virgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space"&gt;like Virgin Galactic plans to do&lt;/a&gt;, and donating seats to space enthusiasts who can’t afford them keeps the public dream of normalized, low-cost space travel alive while the industry races to find the right recipe for bringing prices down. “I think that in any competitive market you’re going to see products improve and/or prices drop,” Christensen added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZWSCG"&gt;The competition has only just begun, and other companies are angling to get into space tourism. Texas-based Axiom Space has plans to build a private space station and arrange private rides on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsules. A new rocket under development by Rocket Lab, the California-based launch company that plans to go public, is designed to launch humans to space in the future. Boeing’s Starliner capsule is designed to ferry private astronauts to the space station, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OjfG8F"&gt;At the moment, there’s no telling which one will make it — if any of them do. For now, space tourism is still in a phase controlled by billionaire cash. Whether or not the industry can grow out of the spectacle and into something more mature will depend less on Bezos or Branson fulfilling their childhood dreams of flying to space and more on bringing down the cost of building rockets — and the price we pay to fly on them.&lt;/p&gt;
