    <title>Elon Musk and Grimes are now ‘semi-separated’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KftewP"&gt;Elon Musk and Claire “Grimes” Boucher have “semi-separated,” according to the SpaceX founder. Musk &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/09/24/elon-musk-and-grimes-break-up-after-three-years-together"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that the two would continue to co-parent their one-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, but that working in different parts of the country had led to them taking more separate paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIyMno"&gt;“We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently, and are on great terms,” Musk told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas, and her work is primarily in LA. She’s staying with me now, and Baby X is in the adjacent room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcHUCw"&gt;The two started dating in 2018 after an exchange about a thought experimental popular in the tech world known as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evkgvz/what-is-rokos-basilisk-elon-musk-grimes"&gt;Roko’s Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly became one of the more unusual couples in their shared domain of tech-pop-space-travel-AI-and-miscellaneous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcStJR"&gt;They made their debut together on the red carpet of&lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/elon-musk-grimes-met-gala"&gt; the Met Gala in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though they arrived separately at this year’s event. The pair had a child together in May last year named X Æ A-Xii, baffling many with the pronunciation of the name (it’s “X Ash A 12,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/7/21251107/elon-musk-baby-name-x-ae-a-12-grimes-son-pronunciation"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;). They worked together when Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427429/elon-musk-snl-clips-wario-dogecoin-monologue-saturday-night-live"&gt;hosted &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a sketch in which the billionaire tech founder played Wario, and the pop star appeared as Princess Peach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlBMYb"&gt;Grimes &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-elon-musk-union-controversy-simply-unprepared-2464497"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1262804/grimes-fiercely-defends-elon-musk-from-critics-amid-claim-he-is-destroying-the-planet-and-humanity"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-takes-to-tiktok-to-defend-elon-musk-again-i-am-not-my-bfs-spokesperson-3025309"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; Musk against criticisms of his work, including the anti-union practices of Tesla (in 2019, a judge found that Musk and other Tesla executives &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20891314/elon-musk-tesla-labor-violation-nlrb"&gt;illegally sabotaged&lt;/a&gt; employees’ attempts to form a union). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making Elizabeth Holmes’ cringey texts public is the ultimate crime deterrent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Executives Elizabeth Holmes And Sunny Balwani Return To Court" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkeWf3YDYCAWK21RJMi8WAW8Qx0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903373/1158861261.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pcbooj"&gt;The Elizabeth Holmes trial has made me more determined than ever to avoid doing crimes. I’ll be sticking to the law from here on out, thank you very much. It’s not for any noble reason — I don’t have any new sense of morality or sudden desire to be a very good person. No, I am zealously sticking to the law because doing crimes could, theoretically, put me in the same position disgraced Theranos founder Holmes is in right now: having my text message history revealed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFREXJ"&gt;Dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/TxB90dEbjHdvfu8KEjdl"&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt; between Holmes and her ex-boyfriend (and ex-business partner) Sunny Balwani were read aloud during Holmes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;trial for fraud&lt;/a&gt; this week. Thousands were released by the prosecution and more were &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/elizabeth-holmes-private-text-messages-leak-during-theranos-fraud-trial.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the messages talked about problems with the blood testing technology, which might help prosecutors show that Holmes knew that they didn’t work as advertised. Others were much more... personal. Like when Holmes texted Balwani “you are the breeze in desert for me.” Now, along with the “might go to jail” thing, Holmes has to live with the knowledge that everyone knows she sent that text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8N3O7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I would plead guilty to crimes I didn’t even commit before I let this get read aloud in court jfc&lt;/p&gt;— Maladroithe (@Maladroithe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Maladroithe/status/1440826183365455876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wQW3fw"&gt;I am not sure if I’m being hyperbolic when I say that is my very worst nightmare. I can confidently say that I’ve never told someone that they’re the breeze in the desert, but my text history is still embarrassing as hell. Isn’t everyone’s? Mine is full of bad tweets and shit talking and screenshots that should never, ever see the light of day. Searching for the word “murder” in iMessage brings up dozens of results, most of which are in conversations about online dating. Here are some moderately-cringe-but-not-too-terrible messages I’ve sent recently:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Why does he look like a caricature of what Jonathan Franzen should look like. Does that make sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cpdBjLyvN675SI1ZMN6EROb1Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874847/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this embarrassing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Wow ya. Twilight is so relevant" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcxP4LIm-ts4yht_gcYg_YJUfT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874856/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, I stand by this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qCO0kM"&gt;And I got to carefully curate these! I got to comb through and pick only a few messages that I thought would help communicate that I am someone who sends somewhat embarrassing texts but am not TOO weird. Holmes just had everything dumped on the internet, for anyone to see. I asked a friend what she would do if that happened to her. “Hang myself I assume,” she responded, in another dubious (and to be clear, exaggerated)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;entry into both of our iMessage histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6kU8E"&gt;If very high-profile public trials like this one can be a deterrent against other people committing crimes like the ones Holmes is accused of, this one is working. I can confidently say I will not develop an inaccurate medical testing device and defraud investors. I am going to be very, very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io4zyv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s Friday, here are fat baby bears </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brown Bear mother with cub, Ursos arctos, Katmai Alaska" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b9O1y7uIa_qWdx-KYcqjloWihv8=/9x0:5111x3401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903369/1140444226.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aTwkRh"&gt;I don’t know about you, but pumpkin spice lattes just aren’t cutting it for me as motivation to get excited about the fall. One thing I can rally around: fat baby bears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb3hSF"&gt;There’s an adorable twist this year to Katmai National Park’s &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-week.htm"&gt;annual Fat Bear Week&lt;/a&gt;. Today is the final day to cast your vote for its “&lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-junior-2021.htm"&gt;junior&lt;/a&gt;” competition. Four cubs faced off yesterday for a chance to compete against the grown-ups when Fat Bear Week officially starts on September 29th. Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1441208427045277703"&gt;only two cubs remain&lt;/a&gt; in the final round of junior voting; the cub who garners the most votes today will move on to the Fat Bear Week bracket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2qBq08"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10771098"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fT37qF"&gt;The park identifies the cubs by their mothers. You can cast your vote for Bear 128’s yearling, who already has the distinction of catching more leaping salmon at the lip of the park’s Brooks Falls than any cub in the park staff’s recent memory. It’s not a skill most cubs master before the tender age of two, according to the park. Or, you can choose Bear 132’s spring cub, who weighs in at more than 60 pounds before even turning one year old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7NOogZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10771103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LBnDXP"&gt;With these two cuties in the running, you really can’t make a bad decision when casting your vote (&lt;a href="https://explore.org/fat-bear-week"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; are open between 12PM to 9PM ET). You’ll find more information and photos of each cub’s transformation as they packed on the pounds this summer on Katmai’s &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-junior-2021.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/KatmaiNPP/?ref=page_internal"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages. And you can search for them on the park’s &lt;a href="https://explore.org/livecams/brown-bears/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls"&gt;bear cams&lt;/a&gt;. You can spot Yearling 128 by her signature blonde ears and Spring Cub 132 by his big, slouchy, brown belly and shaggy, dark brown fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ItM4q"&gt;There are elimination rounds each day of Fat Bear Week until a final chunky champion is named on Fat Bear Tuesday, October 5th. It’s essentially an online popularity contest meant to celebrate the Alaskan brown bears’ full figures. Winter is coming and a fat bear is a prepared bear. The bears eat an entire year’s worth of food in just six months to get ready for hibernation. Over the winter, they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;might lose a third of their body weight, but they’ll start bulking up for next year’s competition come spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California will require all autonomous vehicles to be zero-emission starting in 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4fngUPqQRbrt5SQWfKVwUa-YQo=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903238/vpavic_4412_20210111_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3EVeb7"&gt;California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles (AV) to emit zero emissions starting in 2030. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/"&gt;On Thursday, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law&lt;/a&gt; a bill sponsored by environmental groups that would eventually prohibit gas- and hybrid-powered autonomous vehicles from operating in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNFiSa"&gt;It was the latest move by Newsom to restrict the sale and use of internal combustion engine vehicles amid a broader effort to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the governor signed two executive orders: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304367/california-electric-trucks-vans-clean-air-pollution-mandatory-rule"&gt;one requiring all commercial trucks and vans&lt;/a&gt; sold in the state to be zero-emission starting in 2045 and another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;requiring only the sale of zero-emission passenger vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNPuqe"&gt;California was the first state in the US to prohibit the sale of nearly all fossil fuel-burning vehicles in its borders. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324552/electric-trucks-buses-clean-air-zero-emissions-states"&gt;At least 15 states have followed the state’s lead&lt;/a&gt;, passing similar measures that would apply to heavy-duty trucks, vans, and buses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GbG964"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California is the largest vehicle market in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RAx2Vw"&gt;California is the largest vehicle market in the US, with nearly 15 million registered vehicles on the road. AVs only account for a small fraction of that total amount, but some experts predict those numbers will grow as AVs become more capable and companies move to commercialize their use. Other groups have expressed worry that autonomous vehicles could usher in an era of even more traffic and pollution, especially if AVs are priced cheaper than public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJyX27"&gt;California is ground zero for AV testing in the US, with over 50 companies licensed to operate autonomous vehicles for testing purposes in the state. A handful of companies hold permits to test fully driverless vehicles, without safety drivers behind the steering wheel. And an even smaller number have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520227/cruise-permit-california-driverless-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;approved to pick up and drop off passengers&lt;/a&gt; as part of a commercial robotaxi service. AVs registered in California traveled approximately 1.99 million miles in autonomous mode on public roads in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpTrVz"&gt;The two companies that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276851/california-self-driving-autonomous-cars-miles-waymo-cruise-2020"&gt;comprise the bulk of that testing&lt;/a&gt;, Alphabet’s Waymo and GM-backed Cruise, both operate fully electric vehicles as part of their fleets. Waymo uses the Jaguar I-Pace SUV, as well as the non-electric Chrysler Pacifica minivan, though the company has declined to say exactly how many of each vehicle it owns. Cruise exclusively uses the Chevy Bolt, a vehicle that is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;subject to a massive recall&lt;/a&gt; because some of the batteries have been catching fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TGjAJ"&gt;“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero emissions fleet from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2wdd8"&gt;Environmental groups praised Newsom for signing the bill into law. The Union of Concerned Scientists, &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/california-bill-requires-all-new-self-driving-vehicles-be-zero-emission-2030"&gt;which helped sponsor the legislation&lt;/a&gt;, said it was a “smart policy to ensure that driverless vehicles don’t contribute to the problem” of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vVOzP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16748024/self-driving-electric-hybrid-ev-av-gm-ford"&gt;Some AV operators have argued&lt;/a&gt; that electric vehicles are a bad fit for self-driving cars because of the extended charging requirements. In order to make a profit, autonomous vehicles need to maximize their time on the road, delivering people or packages, otherwise they’re likely to be a money-loser, they argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZqzWd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated September 24th, 10:59AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include a statement from Cruise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyPEin"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vljlqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679389/iphone-13-apple-event-vergecast-podcast-467"&gt;Last week on the show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; went through all of the announcements at Apple’s fall hardware event. This week on the show, it’s review time! Nilay and Dieter are joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior editor Tom Warren to discuss what they learned from spending time with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. A bigger battery and a smaller notch: is it worth the upgrade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Lq015"&gt;The second half of the show is dedicated to another fall hardware event — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;this time from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, we saw a few new devices under the Surface line: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other upgrades. The crew discusses everything announced at the event, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwadPCebCQU"&gt;hands-on demo of the devices&lt;/a&gt; that Dieter was able to experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxhxqf"&gt;There’s a whole lot more packed into the show — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;like an EU proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the Steam Deck’s biggest hurdles just disappeared: EAC has come to Linux</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vEtQCWJa0GMEuX5TtoSQakhq9jY=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901097/steam_deck.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C37GhF"&gt;Valve promised it would work with anti-cheat software makers EAC and BattlEye to ensure some of the most popular games will run on its upcoming Steam Deck Linux-based gaming handheld, and one of those companies is now officially on board — &lt;a href="http://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-launches-anti-cheat-support-for-linux-mac-and-steam-deck"&gt;Epic Games announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) now supports Linux and Mac. Not only that, it’s specifically set up to work with the Proton and Wine compatibility layers that Valve’s relying on to bring Windows games to the Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ekx2Q"&gt;While developers would still need to patch their games, this immediately means some of the most popular games on Steam are now theoretically within reach, including &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dead by Daylight,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;War Thunder, &lt;/em&gt;which are all among &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/"&gt;the top 25 games on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. Other popular EAC games include &lt;em&gt;7 Days to Die&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Desert, Hunt: Showdown, Paladins, &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Halo Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lYB72"&gt;Some key games will still be missing until or unless other anti-cheat providers sign on, though: &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt; are also among the top 25, and all use the rival BattlEye anti-cheat software. So does Epic’s own &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for that matter, but Epic also hasn’t brought &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or the Epic Games Store to Linux desktops. Epic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dncUIz"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, BattlEye CEO Bastian Suter confirmed the software will be compatible with the Steam Deck, saying “the first game might start using it soon.” However, it will be up to individual developers to enable support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pCh1ZZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve Steam Deck hands-on: the Nintendo Switch of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Why the Steam Deck won’t flop like Valve’s Steam Machines","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial"},{"title":"Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616395/valve-steam-deck-windows-11-support-tpm-amd"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gHCGdC"&gt;Epic does suggest it’s easy for developers to patch their EAC games: “Starting with the latest SDK release, developers can activate anti-cheat support for Linux via Wine or Proton with just a few clicks in the Epic Online Services Developer Portal,” writes Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Oo35D"&gt;You can find ProtonDB’s list of the top games that do and don’t work via compatibility layer &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, as well as current lists of games &lt;a href="https://www.easy.ac/en-us/partners/"&gt;that use EAC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.battleye.com/"&gt;BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; at the links embedded in this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eTKdr"&gt;Epic made EAC a free service earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsZNsq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 9:53AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from BattlEye CEO on the status of Steam Deck support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump is a problem for the Backbone controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/085GaNsw_jS9EuF437spwptuDeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902838/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tbCIPR"&gt;The new and very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt; has a thicker camera bump than previous generations (7.65mm vs. 7.4mm in the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max). It sounds negligible, but it’s enough to cause a few small issues with accessory compatibility. For instance, the iPhone 13 Pro apparently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1441086122839339015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1441086122839339015%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger-iphone-13-pro-compatibility%2F"&gt;doesn’t fit perfectly onto the MagSafe Duo dual charger&lt;/a&gt; because of its size. And based on my colleague Sam Byford’s first-hand experience, it also doesn’t fit all that well when placed inside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One, the best iOS controller you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANcZVf"&gt;The Backbone One has a, for lack of a better word, backbone that connects each side of the controller. The iPhone 13 Pro’s camera bump causes the phone to rest unevenly while nested in the Backbone One, making it wobble during use. That’s not a huge issue in itself, aside from the fact that the phone is technically less secure in the controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUUPJ"&gt;But he reported a few disconnect issues while playing, too. And if the device isn’t flat while connected via the controller’s Lightning jack, there’s reason to believe that it could be putting stress on the iPhone 13 Pro’s Lightning port, which may amount to a bigger problem over time. So, keep this in mind if you already have one of these controllers and expect a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Backbone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xux0sfkYNlBFKkOJJ_X76uRpLYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874715/IMG_0225.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sam Byford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side angle of the iPhone 13 Pro fit into the Backbone One controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YU1B23"&gt;We’ve reached out to Backbone to comment on this issue. But this problem isn’t isolated to just this company. Presumably, there are several bespoke accessories, in and outside of the realm of gaming, made to fit iPhones and Android phones up to a certain level of thickness. But as mobile photography gets more advanced, the sensors and lenses built into phones will likely get larger, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnEfwf"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6jbBS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A teenager on TikTok disrupted thousands of scientific studies with a single video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdx6Bl50n4BRsyaDmz97Rkyzjjg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902677/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Researchers were caught by surprise after a short video sent a flood of new users to a survey platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lhMlad"&gt;Thousands of scientific studies had to toss out weeks of data because of a 56-second TikTok video by a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQ03zy"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom/video/6988270489290411269?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;July 23rd video&lt;/a&gt; is short and simple. It opens with recent Florida high school graduate and self-described “teen author” Sarah Frank sitting in her bedroom and smiling at the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw051M"&gt;“Welcome to side hustles I recommend trying — part one,” she says in the video, pointing users to the website Prolific.co. “Basically, it’s a bunch of surveys for different amounts of money and different amounts of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CI6Grs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom/video/6988270489290411269" data-video-id="6988270489290411269" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@sarahndom" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom"&gt;@sarahndom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;i’m excited for this series!! &lt;a title="sidehustles" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sidehustles"&gt;#sidehustles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="sarahssidehustles" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sarahssidehustles"&gt;#sarahssidehustles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="prolific" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/prolific"&gt;#prolific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="makingmoney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makingmoney"&gt;#makingmoney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="sidehustleideas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sidehustleideas"&gt;#sidehustleideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - sarah :)" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6988270314086419206"&gt;♬ original sound - sarah :)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdvMcE"&gt;That video got 4.1 million views in the month after it was posted and sent tens of thousands of new users flooding to the Prolific platform. Prolific, a tool for scientists conducting behavioral research, had no screening tools in place to make sure that it delivered representative population samples to each study. Suddenly, scientists used to getting a wide mix of subjects for their Prolific studies saw their surveys flooded with responses from young women around Frank’s age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjSPES"&gt;For researchers who rely on representative samples of the US population, that demographic shift was a major problem with no obvious cause and no immediately clear way to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KOAnOS"&gt;Doing science on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZsZ0t"&gt;Though not particularly well known, Prolific is part of a small collection of online tools that have transformed the way corporations and scientists study the way people think and act. The first and largest of these research platforms is Amazon-owned Mechanical Turk, which was released in 2005 as a general-purpose platform for crowdsourcing work on repetitive tasks. Soon after it was released, behavioral scientists realized its potential value for their research, and it quickly revolutionized several research fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAZCLY"&gt;“Before Mechanical Turk existed, all social science research had to happen in the laboratory. You’d need to bring in college sophomores and put them through questionnaires and surveys and whatnot,” said Nicholas Hall, director of the Behavioral Lab at the Stanford School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jd3RqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Online research makes it so much easier. You program a survey... you put it online, and within a day, you have 1,000 responses.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgeU1c"&gt;“That’s an enormous time- and labor-intensive endeavor. Online research makes it so much easier. You program a survey... you put it online, and within a day, you have 1,000 responses,” Hall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That changed the face of social science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGSfA7"&gt;The Behavioral Lab at Stanford mainly uses the newer, smaller Prolific platform for online studies these days, Hall said. While many Mechanical Turk customers are big businesses conducting corporate research, Prolific gears its product to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XF5vPK"&gt;The smaller platform offers more transparency, promises to treat survey participants more ethically, and promises higher-quality research subjects than alternative platforms like Mechanical Turk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8VxLU"&gt;Scientists doing this sort of research in the United States generally want a pool of subjects who speak English as a first language, are not too practiced at taking psychological surveys, and together make up a reasonably representative demographic sample of the American population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0FMaE"&gt;Prolific, most agreed, did a good job providing high-quality subjects. The sudden change in the platform’s demographics threatened to upend that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lFmKlc"&gt;TikTok aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iBgKO3"&gt;In the days and weeks after Frank posted her video, researchers scrambled to figure out what was happening to their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a4zk7D"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Analyzing N=300 Prolific study. Very generic title &amp;amp; description. Survey questions mostly about social comparisons &amp;amp; money&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;91% of respondents are female, 7% are male. Don't think I've miscoded anything, and no unusual survey restrictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;— Sebastian Deri (@SebastianDeri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SebastianDeri/status/1423768044610854913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ESocS2"&gt;A member of the Stanford Behavioral Laboratory &lt;a href="https://community.prolific.co/t/studies-80-90-women-age-21-could-be-from-viral-tiktok-about-prolific/4266"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on a Prolific forum, “We have noticed a huge leap in the number of participants on the platform in the US Pool, from 40k to 80k. Which is great, however, now a lot of our studies have a gender skew where maybe 85% of participants are women. Plus the age has been averaging around 21.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3FmgW"&gt;Wayne State psychologist Hannah Schechter seems to have been the first person to crack the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPSEmp"&gt;“This may be far-fetched,” she tweeted, linking to Frank’s video, “but given the timing, virality of the video, and the user’s follower demographics....”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWNyp9"&gt;Long-standing Prolific survey-takers &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc/comments/oyff92/prolific_went_viral_on_tiktok/"&gt;complained on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; that Frank had made it difficult to find paid surveys to take on the overrun platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaNIz9"&gt;“Now it’s just another bullshit site to spend hours and make pennies on,” wrote one user, who said they had previously made $30 a week on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KI0PVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now it’s just another bullshit site to spend hours and make pennies on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wl6I9"&gt;Frank, who “guesstimated” she had made a total of about $80 taking surveys on Prolific before her video, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she also noticed a difference on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzPB4Y"&gt;“Less studies have been available for me and everyone else,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve received some really mean comments accusing me of single-handedly ruining the site and being selfish — even though I received no compensation for that video.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIzI3b"&gt;She added that she hoped Prolific would be able to set up a system to deal with its changed demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtehqZ"&gt;“I also predict that a lot of people who signed up after seeing my video will forget about it, and the surge will die down,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z08lSt"&gt;Prolific co-founder and CTO Phelim Bradley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of the new users do seem to be dropping off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgAfn9"&gt;“Prior to Tiktok, about 50% of the responses on our platform came from women,” he wrote in an email. “The surge knocked this up as high as 75% for a few days, but since then, this number has been trending down, and we’re currently back to ~60% of responses being from women.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_XsjNiD2JQMGXedTaUFm5xrMWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873438/2CC6A4E2_1910_45C9_9FF7_310DB9DA5B9C.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A chart showing the increase in female users over time. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJbCfW"&gt;According to Bradley, about 4,600 studies were disrupted by Frank’s TikTok, around a third of the total that were active on the platform during the surge. Of those, he said, the vast majority should be salvageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT2T2y"&gt;Prolific has refunded researchers whose studies were significantly impacted by the surge in women survey takers and introduced a new suite of demographic screening tools. The company announced these steps a month after Frank posted her video. The company has now re-organized, putting a team in charge of demographic balancing in order to more quickly recognize and respond to this sort of problem in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWSOFT"&gt;“Honestly, we were somewhat caught by surprise, and we didn’t predict how large the impact was going to be,” Bradley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ycRVqu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Young women who enjoy TikTok are people too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tqL1v"&gt;The surge isn’t all bad. Refreshing the pool of survey takers probably has long-term benefits, says Vlad Chituk, a Yale graduate student in psychology who was running several pilot studies on Prolific when the surge hit. When subjects take lots of psychological surveys, they learn the tricks scientists use to gather data, and that can impact the way they respond to future survey questions. Fresh subjects provide higher-quality data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61usw"&gt;“Young women who enjoy TikTok are people too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm2HT4"&gt;As for Frank, she says that her side hustle video is now the most popular TikTok she’s ever posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ViTN"&gt;“It definitely didn’t occur to me that the video would blow up. I just posted it for my friends and followers, not for the reach it ended up getting,” she said. “I think it blew up because the site is genuinely so cool, and people love efficient ways to make money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="l1Ku3W"&gt;For the time being, Frank has paused most of her own side hustles as she settles into her freshman year at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruy31r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmQiCt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on an Alexa-powered soundbar and wall-mounted Echo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S-QcSYi3a5irWJpWuudJbjPZHE=/0x25:1404x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902557/alexa_widgets.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4i6Rk"&gt;What’s next for Amazon’s family of Alexa-powered devices? A little bit of everything, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has a great overview of products the company is reportedly working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3VsO6"&gt;The e-commerce giant has never been afraid of throwing products at the wall to see what sticks, and its plans certainly seem to follow this ideology. Indeed, they even include a new big-screen Echo device that can be mounted on walls. Very appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y27k2Y"&gt;Here’s what Amazon has in the hopper, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7cPjeE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wall-mounted Echo:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the launch of the display-equipped Echo Show line, Amazon is supersizing the screen with a “roughly 15-inch display.” The device is designed to be either mounted on the wall or placed on a stand and would serve all the usual Echo functions, as well as acting as a control panel for smart home devices. It’s also reportedly going to be kitchen-friendly — for watching recipes or Netflix while you cook. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TKvhTA"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexa-powered soundbars:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon has reportedly been working on an Alexa-equipped soundbar with an integrated camera, designed to make video calls easier in the home, as with Facebook’s Portal devices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5JE7KF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second-generation Echo Auto&lt;/strong&gt;. Not many details here, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says an updated Echo Auto “will have a new design and may be able to charge a user’s device with inductive technology.” We were not fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;original Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt;, which was a better Bluetooth adapter and speakerphone than it was an actual navigation tool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LEBbzQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Echo robot woes: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270002/amazon-robot-home-alexa-echo"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon was working on a mobile Echo device with a display that is supposed to follow users around the home. But it seems the product’s future is in jeopardy. “The robot has drawn concerns over its viability from staff,” says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. A report earlier this year from &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322813/amazon-home-robot-vesta-alexa-project-rumors-specs-report"&gt;noted similar issues&lt;/a&gt;. “People are very skeptical — we’re worried it could turn into another Fire Phone,” said one source. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yBb7N8"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Karaoke with Alexa:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m including this one, but it unfortunately seems like it’s not a goer. “The company has explored building an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone codenamed Jackson and planned to release the device this year. But the team working on that product has been disbanded,” said &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. For shame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="biZFN5"&gt;As ever with rumors like these, any or all of these products could fail to make it out the door, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s rumor roundup certainly seems plausible, not least because of Amazon’s eclectic approach to new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YBSeX"&gt;Remember that the company sells not only its mainstream Echo and Echo Dot devices, but also various Echo Show units (with screens), the Echo Studio (better sound), the Echo Spot (an alarm clock), and oddities like the Ring Always Home Cam — a security drone that flies around your house (though this has yet to be released after it was announced last year). A soundbar or larger screen sound quite tepid by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The M1 MacBook Air is $150 off at multiple retailers right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRKwSIANGg4EOrY4-BVQokTLpIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902495/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 MacBook Air, our current pick for the best laptop, is on sale for its best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7xXOT"&gt;There’s no shortage of accolades for the latest MacBook Air with its vaunted M1 CPU. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; last November simply stated that “the new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip is a triumph.” And right now, both the 256GB and 512GB configurations are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfD0FhN1THh#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $150 off, their largest discount to date. This version of the MacBook Air marks some of the most profound improvements to Apple’s hardware architecture and specs. Whisper-quiet operation, a faster processor, and extensive battery life make the 2020 Air the perfect travel companion, even for Windows die-hards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0lZEN"&gt;This deal must be popular, as most configurations are backordered until mid-October currently. Some are available sooner; make sure to check both retailers before you buy the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7PeD9C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCuDBq"&gt;If you’re a mobile gamer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt; is a must-own accessory. This snappy Android controller is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $55&lt;/a&gt; — down from $70 — and is a great way to elevate your mobile gaming experience, especially if you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The controller expands to snugly fit around your phone, providing you with a more traditional and comfortable control scheme. Besides freeing up screen space that would otherwise be occupied by your thumbs, the dual analog sticks allow for far more precise control. Understandably, the Razer Kishi isn’t compatible with all devices and will have difficulty accommodating phones with bulky cases, so make sure to consult the &lt;a href="https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4097/~/which-smartphones-are-supported-by-the-razer-kishi%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official list at Razer&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ug9B0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10228224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i847H3"&gt;The high-end gaming laptops manufactured by the industry veterans at Alienware have never been considered by anyone to be cheap. However, right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDXfMBxEsZ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a cool $200 on the Alienware M15 R4&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,900. This 15-inch version of the latest Alienware laptop comes equipped with an RTX 3070, as well as a 10th Gen Core i7 processor. It also comes packed with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. The 1080p display features a 300Hz refresh rate, too, allowing you to get the most out of this performance powerhouse. The M15 R4 even has a Thunderbolt 3 port, allowing you to dock it and use it as a de-facto desktop or just transfer data very quickly through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="adyhPQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops of 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="zhclBi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10769311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvVvHy"&gt;Anyone looking to up their monitor game should pay attention to this deal on the Dell U2720Q, which is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeWOYDBrandonWidder052821/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q/apd/210-avjv/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for a limited time at Dell for just $540&lt;/a&gt;. This 4K monitor has received &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accolades from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-27-inch-monitor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few, and is a favorite among some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers for good reason. The bright, 27-inch IPS panel features HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, a swiveling stand, and USB-C connectivity, meaning it plays well with laptops. If you’re tired of squinting at your laptop screen, this monitor is a great way to scale up your home office setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rVgBN0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iwjgAf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most convenient ways to access all of your favorite shows and channels — and one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; you can own, in general. No larger than a pack of gum, the 4K streaming device offers quick performance and support for Dolby Atmos, HDR, and AirPlay 2, the latter of which gives you a quick way to wirelessly cast content from a variety of Apple devices. The device’s compact build also means that you can easily hide it behind your TV or pack it away for a trip. Normally $50, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Stick-HDR-Streaming-Long-range/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Amazon for $39&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
