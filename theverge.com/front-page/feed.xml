    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 studio falls victim to ransomware attack, data leak threatened</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNNKh6rP3DdhOazWsgni25QwohA=/31x0:969x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791295/cyberpunk_2077_artwork.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgvVbZ"&gt;CD Projekt says it’s been hacked by attackers who’ve been able to access its internal network, encrypt some devices, and collect “certain data” from the Polish video game company. The &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer says it will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the attacker, and does not believe any personal data of players or service users has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IRC9w"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660"&gt;tweet disclosing the hack&lt;/a&gt;, the company shared the ransom note left by the hackers, who claim to have accessed the source code for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt;, and an “unreleased version of &lt;em&gt;Witcher 3.&lt;/em&gt;” The hackers are threatening to release the source code alongside internal legal, HR, and financial documents “if we will not come to an agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xkTXzK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important Update &lt;a href="https://t.co/PCEuhAJosR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PCEuhAJosR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DbjzoK"&gt;In its statement, CD Projekt says that it has secured its IT infrastructure, and has begun restoring its data from intact backups. It says it has informed the “relevant authorities” as well as IT forensic specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1nvBm"&gt;The attack follows the developer’s troubled launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;The game released with numerous bugs and performance issues on PC, and was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;almost unplayable&lt;/a&gt; on older consoles. Sony subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and offered refunds to players, while Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;also offering refunds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1QzRh"&gt;CD Projekt has been subjected to intense criticism for releasing the game in what critics claim is an unfinished state. The company has vowed to address &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s &lt;/em&gt;performance issues&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;a series of patches&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now facing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;lawsuit from investors&lt;/a&gt; who claim they were misled about the game’s performance prior to release. The developer has also been criticized over reports that its employees were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;forced to work long hours&lt;/a&gt; in the months leading up to the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s CEO wants to talk to President Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Huawei Founder Ren Zhenfei Defiant in Face of Existential Threat" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsTdD_1vM1pdBOjbEt_LxPrcR7k=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791163/1146396255.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywa5HK"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has called for a reset in relations between the US and the Chinese tech giant. Speaking to international media in China for the first time in more than a year, Ren expressed willingness to speak with President Biden and said he hoped for an “open policy” from the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaSejD"&gt;“I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” Ren said in officially interpreted comments &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html"&gt;reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/huawei-ceo-hopes-reset-us-053713079.html"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3121109/huaweis-ren-zhengfei-calls-more-open-us-policy-towards-china-under"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The US wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBEW63"&gt;“If Huawei’s production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for US companies to supply too,” Ren continued. “I believe that’s going to be mutually beneficial. I believe that (the) new administration would bear in mind such business interests as they are about to decide their new policy. We still hope that we can buy large volumes of American materials, components and equipment so that we can all benefit from China’s growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELCDGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Living a Google-free life with a Huawei phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I1WQik"&gt;Huawei is currently unable to do business with US companies because the Trump administration placed it on the Department of Commerce’s trade blacklist, citing national security fears. Among other issues, this means Huawei is unable to license Android from Google, severely hampering its smartphone business outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsVcPY"&gt;This prompted Huawei to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;sell off its Honor subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the brand and allow it to keep on producing smartphones, but Ren dismissed rumors that Huawei might do the same for its own smartphone division. “We have decided we absolutely will not sell off our consumer devices, our smartphone business,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KuUL1"&gt;Ren also reportedly called the iPhone 12 “the world’s best smartphone” and said that it helped make the case for Huawei’s 5G networks. “High-end customers in Europe love Apple,” he said. “Since [Huawei] doesn’t have premium handsets any more, Apple’s phones have helped us prove that Huawei’s 5G technology is good.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will start reminding users to clean out their friends list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snapchat stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7djfIVKR0LECwGevjPbI7ZG2H8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790994/snapchat-stock-0963.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUorx2"&gt;Snap is introducing a new feature it’s calling Friend Check Up. On Snapchat, having someone friended could give them access to your story and even possibly your location, depending on your Snap Map settings, so Snap wants to make sure that everyone on your friends list is still someone you actually want to call your friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLGZ0w"&gt;This feature could help make the platform safer for users, if they choose to use it. It could be a good way to help you realize you might still have somebody friended that you don’t want to see your posts. And I know there’ve been plenty of times when I’ve looked at a friend or follower of mine and said “I have no idea who this person is,” or worse: “oops, my ex can see my sadtweeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltBRxZ"&gt;Snap says that the feature will be rolling out globally on Android “in the coming weeks” and to iOS devices “in the coming months.” The reminder will show up as a notification on your profile screen, as you can see in this GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZ5MTW3FH55onBIeHoVNpBXie6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291047/friend_checkup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Friend Check Up feature shows a notification reminding you to look at your friends list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HoSYJE"&gt;If you’d like to do a check up yourself before the feature rolls out, you can see your friends list by going to your profile and tapping on My Friends. You can remove a friend by tapping and holding on their name until the Block / Remove friend menu appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgjG0Q"&gt;The Friend Check Up feature is part of a push from Snap to make Snapchat a friendlier place, including adding new resources and integrations with the Trevor Project for LGBTQ+ youths, and MindUP for parents trying to understand and support their teenage children. The social network is also getting further integration with the Crisis Text Project for people seeking mental health assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood sued for wrongful death by family of 20-year-old who died by suicide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4E0DF19-tktuXqwLlFsBNRI-rY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790593/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBeyyM"&gt;Last June, 20-year-old Alex Kearns &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/young-trader-dies-by-suicide-after-thinking-he-racked-up-big-losses-on-robinhood.html"&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt;, blaming stock trading app Robinhood for his death. He mistakenly believed he’d lost $730,000, and that the company was coming for more than $170,000 of that money in a matter of days. His family now agrees that it was Robinhood’s fault — on Monday, they sued the company for wrongful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXK3ec"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F493835850%2FKearns-v-Robinhood-complaint&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F8%2F22273600%2Frobinhood-alex-kearns-wrongful-death-lawsuit-stock-options-trading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Kearns never owed any money at all, but that didn’t stop the Robinhood app from suggesting that he did, or sending him an “immediate action required” email telling him he needed to deposit $178,612.73 by June 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQMOAv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillBrewsterSCG/status/1273008513950928896"&gt;Here’s a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; one of his relatives shared on Twitter last June of what the app reportedly showed him at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gwm9Hl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RobinhoodApp&lt;/a&gt; response and can confirm they did reach out. The family isn’t ready to speak yet. Since they can’t release account details here’s the screenshot. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uqeDhro7aJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uqeDhro7aJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bill Brewster (@BillBrewsterSCG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillBrewsterSCG/status/1273008513950928896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ylzk7h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t7bWow"&gt;Kearns reportedly tried to contact Robinhood’s support department four times, but only got an automated message. The day after he died, Robinhood sent another automated message to let him know he didn’t actually owe money at all, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; story that includes an interview with Kearns’ family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3aFAj"&gt;Later that month, when the news of his death spread, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/6/19/commitments-to-improving-our-options-offering"&gt;Robinhood promised to change how its app worked&lt;/a&gt;, educate its users, and pledged $250,000 to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGhrKq"&gt;The new lawsuit isn’t the only reason this story is freshly relevant. Robinhood is also now facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; for its role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;the GameStop / Reddit / Wall Street Bets saga&lt;/a&gt;, where individual traders banded together to manipulate stocks that had been shorted, but some traders are blaming them for huge losses after Robinhood froze how much and when they could invest. The company’s software also automatically sold some options (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;though not shares, Robinhood claims&lt;/a&gt;) out from under traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7D5Ki"&gt;Either way, the huge run on GameStop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;now seems to be over&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike Kearns, many people may have lost tremendous amounts of real money gambling via Robinhood and other apps. If you know someone who did, they can find &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"&gt;the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-273-8255.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam has officially come to China, and Sony’s PS5 is officially coming too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2udUjga_EqE0YEzhxE8IDRFEkK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790204/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ats0u"&gt;Though the international version of Steam has been available in China for years, &lt;a href="https://store.steamchina.com/"&gt;an official Chinese release&lt;/a&gt; of the the popular PC gaming platform has now debuted (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1358859000029274116?s=20"&gt;via analyst Daniel Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;). If Chinese gamers needed more reason to celebrate, Sony also announced that the PlayStation 5 will be coming to the country soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P04ZWe"&gt;The Chinese version of Steam currently only has around 40 titles available, with another 10 or so listed as coming soon. Included in that list are, of course, Valve’s own e-sports titles &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;. The service is a long time coming — Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17451484/steam-china-announced-valve-perfect-world"&gt;announced that it would be bringing it to China back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though Chinese gamers have been able to access the service with Steam’s global client. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGlj21PfO_JMk8wNw6_VNl3PALE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290847/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_3.15.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam China’s storefront.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IHlpFk"&gt;The global version, however, has always had the risk of being shut down at any time by the government, as it contains games that haven’t been officially approved. According to &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-21-valve-talks-steam-china-curation-exclusivity"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Valve’s official Chinese client will only contain games that have gone through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202812/chinese-censorship-hurt-apples-bottom-line"&gt;the official approval process&lt;/a&gt;, though the company does expect the global version to still be available alongside the official one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lhHj7p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Store is now live: &lt;a href="https://t.co/dYKF6JAaYX"&gt;https://t.co/dYKF6JAaYX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has about 40 games + interoperability with Steam International. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4K7WCzKoSY"&gt;https://t.co/4K7WCzKoSY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1358859000029274116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0hO4v"&gt;For Chinese gamers that prefer consoles, Sony is planning on launching the PlayStation 5 in Q2 2021 — though it remains to be seen whether the launch will be plagued with the stock issues seen in the rest of the world. So far, there have only been a handful of modern consoles officially released in the country, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/25/9039995/china-ends-ban-on-video-game-consoles"&gt;they were banned from 2000 to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/11/7376315/Sony-ps4-joins-microsoft-xbox-one-in-china"&gt;The PlayStation 4, Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994756/nintendo-switch-china-launch-release-date-price-tencent"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; all got Chinese versions, but it looks like the PS5 may be the first next-gen console to officially arrive, as Microsoft hasn't yet announced plans to bring the Xbox Series X and S consoles to the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sony China has confirmed that it plans to officially launch the PlayStation 5 in Mainland China during Q2 2021. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tatsuo Eguchi, the president of SIE Shanghai and Soeda Takehito, the vice chairman, confirmed the new today in a special Chinese New Year greetings video. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nhFzbZQTGx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nhFzbZQTGx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1358644519370121216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02BYia"&gt;For both Steam and Sony, having another billion plus customers available to buy their products is a big deal. Some developers based in China, however, are less enthusiastic, raising concerns that the Chinese government may block the global version of Steam now that an official version exists. That would obviously lead to less access for gamers, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/why-chinese-developers-are-worried-about-steam-china-launching-next-week/"&gt;and make it harder for Chinese developers to share their games with the world.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’ve wondered what Horizon Zero Dawn might look like on a graphing calculator, here you go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCJS28mamjXeE3Bch7T27-kp-dU=/248x0:2632x1589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790161/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_12.15.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RIVVAp"&gt;What are we actually looking at here? A rock? An enemy? Does it even matter compared to the glory of running &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the eye-watering resolution of 128 pixels wide by 72 pixels tall? Yes, a YouTuber has managed to play &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at 72p, and that’s not a typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpXhXs"&gt;The YouTuber in question is Kryzzp, who also goes by zWORMz Gaming, and he ran the game at this absurd resolution to test the performance of an Nvidia GT 710, an ultra-budget video card &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/63612-nvidia-launches-dirt-cheap-geforce-gt-710-graphics.html"&gt;that barely cost $40 brand-new back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Incredibly, he manages to fend off one of the robotic enemies, though it’s impossible to tell how much ammo he had left after doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xjEJu9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know the PC Version of Horizon: Zero Dawn lets you toggle the resolution to 72p? (256x144) &lt;a href="https://t.co/3nYccHPQDZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3nYccHPQDZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— St1ka (@St1ka) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/St1ka/status/1357896709846753283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGqX7y"&gt;To put that 128x72 resolution in context, it’s actually less than a modern color graphing calculator like the TI-84 Plus CE, whose 320x240 screen has far more pixels. You might imagine the game looking like this on a Game Boy Advance, but you’d still be missing the mark: that 2001 portable had a screen resolution of 240x160. The older TI-8E graphing calculators had a resolution of 96 x 64, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g89KsB"&gt;While watching someone struggle to play a game at a resolution that would’ve been considered bad 10 years ago may be funny, it’s also intriguing — what other games can you run like this? There’s probably some fun to be had posting ultra-low resolution screenshots to the internet and having people guess what what game they’re looking at. “Is it &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt;? I can really only make out a car.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LI9aRz"&gt;I think it’s safe to say that this almost loops around to be aesthetically pleasing again. It’s like looking at a game from an alternate reality where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/25/3254670/another-world-the-classics"&gt;Amiga-style graphics&lt;/a&gt; stayed in vogue forever, even after the switch to 3D. It’s beautiful in its own way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrK38v"&gt;If you want to try running it like this for yourself, you’ll need some low-powered hardware, as what resolutions are available seems to depend on which graphics card you have. My ThinkPad’s Intel HD 620 integrated graphics are technically more powerful than the Nvidia GT 710, so the lowest resolution I was able to run the game at was 160x100 (after adjusting the in-game resolution scaling to 50 percent). Not that I was able to actually run, like the mission asked me to — I couldn’t read the button prompt on the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ZA71bM1G85lcRL1AkJjMKmd3Sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290525/HZR_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m really appreciating the game’s stunning visuals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Facebook will now take down posts claiming vaccines cause autism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlUZ5n247AdcYwfqYChnltxdJJ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789631/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zzmqU"&gt;Facebook is expanding what false claims &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims"&gt;it will remove from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; related to COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines, and vaccines in general starting today. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing debunked COVID-19 claims&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year and notifying customers when they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;interacted with a post that has false information&lt;/a&gt; that same month. But now the list of potential claims that could get a post removed has grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyRP1M"&gt;Highlights from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"&gt;the new expanded list&lt;/a&gt; of false COVID-19 and vaccine-related claims that will be removed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9vM27y"&gt;COVID-19 is man-made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GCcJuD"&gt;Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease they were created to protect against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h4igga"&gt;It’s safer to get a disease than to get its vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hjr4Uh"&gt;Vaccines are dangerous, toxic, or cause autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wo3mKs"&gt;Facebook says it will start enforcing this policy immediately, focusing on groups, pages, and accounts that share content from its new list of debunked claims. The company also says it would consider removing the sources of the posts entirely if they became repeat offenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZkFT9"&gt;Notably, the company says that it will only be enforcing this change during the “COVID health emergency,” so while tamping down on such claims could be a major blow to the anti-vaccine movement on Facebook, it might not last long. Even if it remains brief, it’s an important change, Facebook was a major source of vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18225439/facebook-google-anti-vax-conspiracy-theories-pressure"&gt;even before the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and addressing it more directly could have a meaningful impact on people who might have otherwise become anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAODxW"&gt;Expanding what counts as COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation is a smart move for Facebook, but some people worry what posts might get caught in the company’s new, larger misinformation net. Studies into the effectiveness of certain masks, vaccines, and tests are still ongoing. As written, Facebook’s new guidelines might prevent conversations around new research results, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358851207763283971"&gt;UNC Professor Zeynep Tufekci notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AyXj9A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looking at the list, Facebook may have to take down some current real news and public health statements, too. We have ongoing clinical trials with no placebo, for example. (UK heterologous prime boost trial) Also today's reports on ChAdOx1? May need to go under these guidelines. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCCNi6eeBT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCCNi6eeBT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358844175085686788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLeFC8"&gt;What’s more, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358843227982471168"&gt;Tufekci points out&lt;/a&gt;, recommendations from public health agencies have changed over the course of the pandemic, which may mean that older posts from organizations like the World Health Organization may also be removed. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Facebook with these concerns and will update if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfcYpO"&gt;Outside of those policy changes, Facebook is also making adjustments to how factual COVID-19 information &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reaching-billions-of-people-with-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;gets delivered on Facebook and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. The company will feature links to vaccine information and for signing up to receive a vaccination in its COVID-19 Information Center, and it plans to bring the feature to Instagram as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85QFBM"&gt;Facebook also says that its continuing to improve search on both platforms to surface more “relevant, authoritative results” when a user searches something related COVID-19, including displaying users who discourage vaccinations lower in search results on Instagram. Finally, Facebook is extending $120 million in ad credits to “help health ministries, NGOs, and UN agencies” spread COVID-19 vaccine information to Facebook’s billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkDXbh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1LXNW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom adds facial effects so you can look your weirdest during meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zooms new Studio Effects feature lets you add facial hair, lip color and eyebrows in any color." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUtLQ47mtmLcKg3C0Qsg6eIT-iQ=/14x0:1073x706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789546/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.19.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOH6fb"&gt;While Zoom was originally created as a serious meeting application for businesses, it has since become one of the most-used services during the pandemic for anyone who wants to have a face-to-face virtual conversation. As a result, the company has been adding more fun stuff, such as weird backgrounds, to use for online family gatherings, friend chats, and well, for business meetings. And now, it’s come up with a feature called Studio Effects that gives you the ability to add a variety of eyebrows, facial hair, and lip color to your video image during Zoom sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ5rUG"&gt;The feature, still in beta, isn’t really new — &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360049041052-New-Updates-for-September-21-2020"&gt;Zoom announced it in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; — but this is the first time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1358880050989457408"&gt;many Zoom users are first discovering it&lt;/a&gt;. At any rate, it’s easy to find. Start up a Zoom session and go to Video Settings (which is found by hitting the arrow next to “Stop Video” at the bottom of the screen). From there, select “Background &amp;amp; Filters” and look for “Studio Effects (Beta)” in the lower right-hand corner. (You may need to download the effects package first — go ahead, it will only take a minute.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Studio Effects (Beta)” and you can change your look from this to the more interesting one above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QvX_dTAmywDIr726S5AYAqskmZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290673/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.17.15_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Studio Effects (Beta)” and you can change your look from this to the more interesting one above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lNlKdH"&gt;After that, you can affect any look you want. Always wanted Groucho Marx eyebrows or a villainous goatee or bright green lipstick? It’s there for the trying. And you can set your facial effects for either just that meeting or for every meeting you’re in (which may not be a good idea if you think you may have a last-minute job interview coming up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HJCH3"&gt;We’ve reached out to Zoom to find out how widespread this new feature is (so far, several staffers here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have reported seeing it in their Zoom applications). Personally, while this is a lot of fun, I’m hoping that Zoom will add hairstyles to its Studio Effects — those of us who are still suffering from pandemic hair (in other words, who haven’t visited a hair salon in about a year) would be extremely grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A West Virginia newspaper chain is suing Google and Facebook over digital ad revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mquqLy9a1IyNvqfDZKqWOIv6LZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789532/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlgPHE"&gt;The parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, alleging the platforms are siphoning away much-needed digital ad revenue. It &lt;a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/hd-media-files-first-of-its-kind-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-and-facebook,185360#"&gt;appears to be the first such lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by a news organization against the digital giants and makes the argument that the platforms represent a digital monopoly that should be broken up, like Standard Oil or AT&amp;amp;T were back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSDvu"&gt;“Google and Facebook have monopolized the digital advertising market thereby strangling a primary source of revenue for newspapers across the country,” according to the complaint filed by HD Media, which operates the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Charleston Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; and several other West Virginia newspapers.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The company bought the &lt;em&gt;Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; out of bankruptcy in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRou7P"&gt;Doug Reynolds, president of HD Media, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a telephone interview that the company decided it was time to challenge the status quo in the digital ad marketplace, not just for its own newspapers but for the entire news industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqGoNP"&gt;“In the last 18 months, we more than doubled our digital subscriptions. Our readers pay good money to engage with our content digitally,” Reynolds said. “We were trying new products, like newsletters and podcasts, and we kept reaching more people. But our revenue kept going down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJNGb"&gt;Google and Facebook designed the current ad revenue ecosystem, then competed on the playing field they created, Reynolds added. “Then, they’re keeping score on the same playing field,” he said. “It’s an untenable position.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXPuAu"&gt;The suit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia refers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;last year’s House Judiciary report&lt;/a&gt; that examined whether the practices of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook violated antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8tW7ik"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Congress releases blockbuster tech antitrust report","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JEoywq"&gt;“As set forth in the House Judiciary Report, Defendants’ anti-competitive and monopolistic practices have had a profound effect upon our country’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry,” the complaint states. It then lists some sobering statistics about the newspaper industry: ad revenue fell by more than 50 percent between 2006 and 2017, and 20 percent of newspapers have closed over the past 16 years. “The reduction in revenues to newspapers across the country, including Plaintiff, were directly caused by Defendants’ conduct,” according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttyh4x"&gt;The complaint is similar to a case in Texas last year, which alleged Google and Facebook worked together to sabotage “header bidding,” which allowed advertisers, including competitors, to bypass Google’s ad auctions. Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton said Google “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing” in online ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAeZEf"&gt;The West Virginia suit alleges that Google and Facebook, normally rivals in the digital ad market, had a secret agreement code named “Jedi Blue.” That deal, the suit claims, was a quid-pro-quo where “Facebook would largely forego its foray into header bidding and would instead bid through Google’s ad server. In exchange, Google agreed to give Facebook preferential treatment in its auctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxgRSa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; first reported on the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/technology/google-facebook-ad-deal-antitrust.html"&gt;existence of the Jedi Blue program&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year based on redacted references from the Texas case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtirH5"&gt;Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-misleading-attack-on-our-ad-tech-business/"&gt;pointed to a blog post Google released earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; in response to the Texas complaint, particularly a section that highlighted what he said were “mischaracterizations about our Open Bidding agreement with Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZKw4"&gt;According to the blog post, open bidding works with “a range of ad networks and exchanges to increase demand for publishers’ ad space, which helps those publishers earn more revenue. [Facebook Audience Network]’s participation helps that. But to be clear, Open Bidding is still an extremely small part of our ad tech business, accounting for less than 4 percent of the display ads we place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpXPSG"&gt;The company does not manipulate the open bidding process in Facebook’s favor, the post states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpP3IH"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnNPt4"&gt;Reynolds says he expects the suit to take several years to resolve, but he’s prepared for a long battle. “I think my preference would be for these companies to be broken up the way Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T were,” he added. He says when he bought the &lt;em&gt;Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, readers clearly understood the intrinsic value of having a thriving local newspaper, something Reynolds believes is in danger if the industry can’t figure out how to get control of its ad revenues again. “There will be no local newspaper coverage in ten years if we don’t win this suit,” Reynolds said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6tkVC"&gt;A company called Expanscape has created the most Inspector Gadget-like device that I’ve ever seen. It’s a laptop prototype called the Aurora 7 (a working title), and attached to its humongous black box of a chassis are six extra displays that extend out in every direction away from the main screen, each showing its own windows and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdXSlV"&gt;If you’re like me, the first thought that comes to mind is “that poor hinge!” Yeah, poor hinge, indeed. Many laptop hinges don’t gracefully handle having one screen attached, let alone seven. Piggybacking on the main 17.3-inch 4K display are three other screens of the same size and resolution. Above the left and right displays is a single seven-inch 1200p monitor. You’ll also find one more seven-inch 1200p touchscreen display mounted into the wrist rest. This prototype weighs about 26 pounds and is 4.3 inches thick. It has an imposing, intimidating presence, and I haven’t even seen it in person.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bow down to the Aurora 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9VQQo"&gt;What GPU is responsible for powering its four 4K displays? None other than the midrange Nvidia GTX 1060, which isn’t exactly a powerhouse. It also has an Intel Core i9-9900K processor and 64GB of RAM. You can find more specs &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/aurora-7-prototype-specifications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In future revisions, Expanscape wants to use the Nvidia RTX 2070 instead, with options for the AMD Ryzen 9 3950x processor or Intel’s i9-10900K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl7BtJ"&gt;Even though it’s built primarily to be a mobile security operations station (and stay plugged pretty much all the time), maybe it’ll be able to run some games, too. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-no-surprise-this-absolutely-obscene-7-screen-laptop-1846222859"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noticed in its write-up of this gadget that its current prototype can last for just one hour before the battery cries for more power, which is frankly longer than I expected. It uses a secondary 148Wh battery just to power its additional displays, and that’s over the FAA’s legal limit to fly in a plane. Expanscape says it’s working to remedy this in future prototypes. In other words, the company is committed to letting you &lt;em&gt;bring a seven-screen laptop onto a plane&lt;/em&gt;. You’d probably have to buy a whole row of seats for the necessary space to use it, though. (If you’re reading this in the future, please take a picture of one of these if you see it on your plane.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Razer’s laptop with three screens is unreal|25617" data-volume-uuid="2868e7566" data-volume-id="25617" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-723" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEk5xO"&gt;Sure, the Aurora 7 looks more rough around the edges than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;Razer’s triple-screened Project Valerie laptop&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. But nevertheless, Expanscape claims it’s willing to actually sell this thing, which is more than Razer can say about its Valerie concept. If you want to buy one, &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/a7-m3-prototype-pricing/"&gt;Expanscape says it can help interested parties in reserving a prototype of its upcoming revision&lt;/a&gt;. As for the price, the company will ask you to sign a nondisclosure agreement, prohibiting you from publicly sharing the cost. That doesn’t bode well for the bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKcYF"&gt;I look forward to hearing more about future revisions of the Aurora 7, especially if it gets a button that makes all of the displays pop open in a comical fashion. Currently, it seems like &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/screen-transition-method/"&gt;an extremely manual process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
