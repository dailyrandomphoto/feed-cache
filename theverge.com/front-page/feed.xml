    <title>Huawei MateBook 16 review: a nose(cam) short of great</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It has an excellent screen, but some weird quirks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dzH3QW"&gt;Huawei laptops haven’t been widely available in the US for years. But they’ve traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17396818/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-specs-price"&gt;been fantastic products&lt;/a&gt;, with good enough performance and build quality to make them serious MacBook competitors. So I figured I’d review the MateBook 16, Huawei’s latest flagship notebook, even though it may not be on the radars of our US readers. Consider this a resource for those in markets where Huawei is still operating but also a quick check on what the rest of us are missing out on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CkuEj"&gt;On the outside, the MateBook 16… kind of looks like a MacBook Pro. Huawei’s got the colors and the general vibe down pat. Whether it performs as well as a MacBook is, of course, another question. Most of the MateBook 16 is great, from the speedy and comfortable keyboard to the all-day battery life, massive 3:2 display, and surprisingly powerful speakers. I know people who have replaced MacBooks with MateBooks as a primary driver, and I can see how for most office workers, the daily experience is quite similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERexf5"&gt;But the main difference is that when I’m using a MateBook, I occasionally come across weird things. They’re not things that make or break the experience, but they’re just odd flaws for such a nice laptop to have. And they add up to make a product that’s great but not as great as it feels like it easily could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jx6PT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10873827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 on a black table facing forward, open. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJK1Ck3zU5OKMckBDJ9Pn2qrtys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906773/akrales_211005_4788_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could convince me this was a MacBook in dim lighting from far away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HoTVFH"&gt;I should note, before we get too far into this, that the MateBook is only available in a somewhat limited number of countries. Currently, you can only order it directly from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fmatebook-16%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in China or Germany as of this writing. (I can’t imagine it will be available within the US any time soon, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684274/huawei-honor-blacklist-entity-list-commerce-pentagon-energy-state"&gt;Huawei’s relationship with&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration.) If you’re outside of those countries but are willing to ship one over, I have found &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $1,259. My test unit, which has a Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB of memory, and 512G of storage, is currently available for $1,469 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course, the usual caveats about ordering from third-party sites apply if you’re going to shop there — you probably won’t recieve a warranty, you may need to get a separate charger, and you should make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MhYjAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The highlight of this device is the display&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FcH2zk"&gt;If you are able to get your hands on one of these, it has a number of selling points. It’s fairly light for a 16-inch notebook at 4.39 pounds. The trackpad is smooth and roomy, though it occasionally had issues with palm rejection. The keyboard is sturdy and impressively quiet — it’s probably the most MacBook-esque keyboard I’ve ever used on a Windows laptop (and I mean the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;recent models&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;god-awful butterfly ones&lt;/a&gt;). There’s a useful port selection with two USB-C, two USB-A, a headphone jack, and HDMI. The speakers are quite good, with bass that’s a bit weak. It’s got an unobtrusive, professional look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad on the Huawei MateBook 16 seen from above and to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g8y5J1bfUuWEW21m9ZNBNpFi-0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908078/akrales_211005_4788_0040.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad is “a durable matte glass.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z0rtMj"&gt;The highlight of the device, for me, is the display. Not only is it a whopping 16 inches, but it has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is my favorite laptop aspect ratio. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7#:~:text=An%20aspect%20ratio%20is%20the,divides%20down%20to%2016%3A9."&gt;Yes, I have a favorite&lt;/a&gt;.) There’s a ton of vertical space, and I comfortably worked in multiple windows side by side; as someone who generally uses a 13-incher, the extra room feels luxurious. The panel itself, while not quite MacBook quality, still displays strong colors and sharp details and kicked back almost no glare. I enjoyed looking at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button on the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aK8quarfyUuVxCzVd8qyRxef4wM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908077/akrales_211005_4788_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0Adq4a"&gt;Now, for the weird things. The MateBook’s microphones come equipped with Huawei’s Ai noise cancelation technology that’s supposed to reduce echo and ambient noise, but coworkers said that it made me sound very weird on Zoom calls. It was clearly processing my voice while I was speaking; someone said I sounded like I was underwater. They could still hear and understand me just fine, but it’s an odd caveat to such a nice laptop. I’ve asked Huawei about this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em8xaa"&gt;Another oddity: the SSD is partitioned? There are essentially two drives on the MateBook 16. I’ve asked Huawei why this is, but I really can’t fathom why this would be necessary on a consumer laptop. It seems likely to cause needless confusion and hassle — I had various downloads interrupted midway because they’d been dumped into a partition that didn’t have room, and I had to move a bunch of things around to accommodate a large folder I was trying to load that was well under 512GB but too big for either partition. Finding files and applications that I needed was also more complicated, because I couldn’t always remember which drive they were on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNWMYS"&gt;And finally, the webcam. The MateBook has a nosecam that pops out of the keyboard’s top row when you press down on it. This, to me, is the equivalent of having no webcam — I’d rather be a black square on Zoom calls than have coworkers staring up my nostrils. So that’s also a thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dHBO0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The microphones made me sound weird on Zoom calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKYRI_-_jH0Hq2OfOq6uS_ebdbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925609/akrales_211012_4788_0134.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, this is where the webcam is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, depressed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHj9m8Jft46JL30wr4pY1NFp7YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925608/akrales_211012_4788_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, seriously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9JGENg"&gt;Huawei enthusiasts can use a Multi-Screen collaboration feature to connect the MateBook 16 to a Huawei phone or tablet. You can then drag and drop files between the tethered devices, access their apps interchangeably, or use the latter as a traditional external display. I wasn’t able to test this, as I didn’t have any Huawei phones or tablets on hand, but it sounds convenient and similar to Apple’s Sidecar feature. It does seem that you have to &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-matebook-16-review-3028122/"&gt;enter a passcode&lt;/a&gt; every time you reconnect a device, which would probably drive me up the wall after a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF40td"&gt;The MateBook also connects easily to Huawei earbuds — per Huawei, the two gadgets will prompt you to pair them automatically if you put them near each other. Huawei is clearly moving towards a robust and developed ecosystem, though whether people buy in will likely depend on how well the features continue to work as new products are released. Regardless, it’s something I’m jealous of as someone whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose 700&lt;/a&gt; come disconnected from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book&lt;/a&gt; at least a few times a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 seen from above angled to the right side, open. The screen displays a blue and purple desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4AwsZtUMcfBz28Lmg9NgUNgJHpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908075/akrales_211005_4788_0031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Multi-Screen Collaboration, use a Huawei tablet as a touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 on a table with a potted plant in the background, angled to the right, open. The screen displays a blue and purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTXlfr5ELwDOvkGSUay6ozKF5pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908071/akrales_211005_4788_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;90 percent screen-to-body ratio — it’s a beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TdcNIf"&gt;As a work driver, the MateBook’s eight-core Ryzen processor did an excellent job. The fans were silent under heaps of Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls. I was never worried about anything crashing or slowing down, and nothing was ever hot. You can switch to a dedicated Performance Mode by pressing FN+P, though I’m not sure where a user who doesn’t have Huawei’s reviewers’ guide would find that information out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvdVfZ"&gt;As we generally expect from AMD Ryzen 5000 systems, the MateBook did quite well on multi-core benchmarks and lagged behind a bit on single-core devices. It also did not blow any graphical tasks out of the water — AMD’s integrated graphics haven’t received a major update for a couple years. We saw an average of 15 frames per second on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at the MateBook’s native resolution of 2520 x 1680 and 28fps at 1920 x 1080. Neither of those is a fantastic gaming experience, and they’re significantly worse than what we saw from the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Por5PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10874105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7uBhY"&gt;The MateBook took 13 minutes and 44 seconds to complete our 4K export test. This isn’t a terrible result among AMD systems with integrated graphics, but it does underscore the delta between a system like this and a heavier-duty creative workstation (which people often expect 16-inch laptops to be). The most recent MacBook Pros, even the 14-incher, all took under three minutes for the same task. On the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;Puget Systems&lt;/a&gt; benchmark for Premiere Pro, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65556"&gt;MateBook also landed&lt;/a&gt; far behind Apple’s machines, including the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;very similarly priced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65275"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. None of this is to say that the MateBook is a bad laptop; it’s just to emphasize that you can get more graphics power for this price if that’s a priority for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L67Cy7NBjMm_kfcOYJBijN2arS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908080/akrales_211005_4788_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Yp1lMwnDwi-QfwfaNtwZIRcXGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908074/akrales_211005_4788_0103.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, one HDMI, one audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2J591W"&gt;What AMD’s chips tend to lack in single-core power, though, they often make up for in battery life. The MateBook comes with an 84Wh battery, and I averaged just over 10 hours of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. (Huawei claims you’ll get 12.5 hours of “continuous local 1080p video playback,” so I guess take note if you do a lot of that.) That does beat the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; (although not by a ton) and many Intel laptops of this size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnpKIt"&gt;To me, the battery life is the strongest argument in favor of buying the MateBook. It should get you through a workday with no problem, which is especially impressive considering the massive high-resolution screen. I’d love to be able to carry this around a conference, charger-free, and have so much real estate to work with whenever I opened it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 7 sticker on the right palm rest of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmUnd9v-cCxEuYiM0Q0LDH4WK_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908076/akrales_211005_4788_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to AMD, it’s Huawei’s most powerful MateBook to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="liRMMg"&gt;While the MateBook 16 seems like a notebook with the potential to have widespread appeal, the folks I’d most recommend it to are largely still Huawei superfans. The MateBook’s compatibility with other Huawei products is something that nothing from Apple or Asus can offer. I can see that benefit outweighing the odd drawbacks for people that already own other Huawei devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hC3cDy"&gt;For everyone else, I think the MateBook could be a fine purchase for a general work driver, but you can get other laptops with most of the same benefits and without the weirdness surrounding the webcam, speakers, and drive. Even if MacBook Pros are outside your price range, many Ryzen devices have similar performance and battery life to the MateBook, as well as a functional webcam and microphones. The MacBook Air is basically there as well (and as bad as its webcam is, I’ll take that over a nostril shot any day). Basically, I think you have to really, really want the 16-inch, 3:2 screen for the MateBook to have a shot. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 boosters for all US adults</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by OLIVER BUNIC/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUXkk3"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration opened booster shots for the &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-receive-expanded-us-fda-emergency-use"&gt;Pfizer / BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-fda-authorization-booster-dose-covid-19"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccine to all adults today, the companies announced, expanding eligibility outside of the initial, vulnerable groups they were cleared for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679950/fda-covid-vaccine-booster-pfizer-older-adults"&gt;this fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io7B96"&gt;Although the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are still highly effective protection against severe cases of the disease, hospitalization, and death, protection against any infection or symptoms appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-cdc-boosters-elderly.html"&gt;weakening&lt;/a&gt;. A third, booster shot of the vaccines could restore that protection: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/21/health/pfizer-booster-dose-efficacy-wellness-bn/index.html"&gt;Pfizer showed&lt;/a&gt; in a clinical trial that the shot was around 95 percent effective compared with people who only had two doses, essentially restoring the same efficacy seen in the initial clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nsCZ"&gt;Analysis out of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the United Kingdom, which have been using booster doses for longer than the US, also show that a third shot significantly blunts infection rates. They’re available to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/uk-extends-covid-booster-vaccines-to-the-over-40s.html"&gt;anyone over 40&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom and anyone &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/israel-doubles-down-on-covid-booster-shots-as-breakthrough-cases-rise.html"&gt;over 12&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwyDfw"&gt;Until now, booster shots of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were officially available to people 65 years of age and older, those who are at high risk of severe disease, healthcare workers, and other people at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at work. However, in response to recent upticks in infection rates, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/arkansas-boosters-adults-covid.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; have moved ahead and started offering third doses to everyone. (Everyone who got the one-shot Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;already eligible&lt;/a&gt; for a second dose).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWYlFY"&gt;Just over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total"&gt;16 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the United States who had an initial vaccine series have already received a booster shot.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy will send someone to wash your e-bike and fix flat tires, for a price</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Cowboy 4 (shown here) is also available in a step-through model.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlLhWg"&gt;Cowboy, one of Europe’s premier makers of electric commuter bikes, is now offering a mobile support service in 22 cities with more to follow; 14 in the EU and eight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22687710/cowboy-ebike-us-sell-c4-price-specs"&gt;in the US where Cowboy only recently set up operations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRxWxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cowboy-bikes.medium.com/e-bike-designer-and-maker-cowboy-unveils-cowboy-care-taking-the-entire-industry-by-storm-and-9fb55a57fb42"&gt;Cowboy Care costs €20 / £20 / $20 a month&lt;/a&gt; and covers cleaning the bike, tightening screws, replacing parts, and fixing flat tires wherever owners might be. It launches just in time for shipments of the much-anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;Cowboy 4 and 4ST e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. After some delays to the original September target, the newest Cowboys will begin deliveries next week to people who got their preorders in early, according to Adrien Roose, co-founder and CEO of Brussels-based Cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2_5eOgNm2iB7SZZ3emdvCQZ21s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027023/cowboy_care.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cowboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unlimited number of Cowboy Care appointments can be scheduled in the Cowboy app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jZkYJW"&gt;Cowboy Care appointments — broken down by maintenance, repair, and flat tire fixes — can be booked in Cowboy’s iOS and Android apps. A trained technician, employed by Cowboy, is then dispatched to meet the owner to deal with whatever request they might have. Cowboy notes that care is unlimited, “the technician comes to the rider as many times as they need us there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKNz5P"&gt;In-home repairs are not new for Cowboy. As Roose explained during a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today, the company already dispatches technicians to homes for warranty repairs. Cowboy Care subscriptions extend that model to include maintenance services like cleaning the frame, belt drive, and brakes; tightening the belt, bolts, and screws; topping-up the tire pressure; servicing brakes; top-to-bottom checkups; and fixing flat tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of0SVl"&gt;Parts needed to replace brake pads, tires, and inner tubes are included in the subscription price. However, out-of-warranty repairs like snapped belt drives, busted motors, and batteries that have reached end of life are not currently covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xs6iXw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for e-bike companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="72Uy05"&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for direct-to-consumer e-bike companies like Cowboy, Rad Power, and VanMoof, each of which have raised millions to build out their networks of roaming technicians. Purchasing an e-bike over the internet can save the buyer money, but bypassing traditional bike shops can mean boxing up your e-bike and shipping it back across the globe for repairs. That’s especially true for e-bikes from makers like Cowboy and VanMoof that use large numbers of custom parts, instead of the off-the-shelf parts found in commodity e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcgUDP"&gt;Cowboy Care is available now in the European cities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, London, Gent, Munich, Brussels, Cologne, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Dusseldorf, Utrecht, and Frankfurt. It’ll be live in the US cities of San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Seattle, San Diego, and Portland in time for the first US shipments of the C4 and C4ST to arrive in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Google devices</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Mh0_3X0EfpRrKKHupmlvHZ18yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164962/ajohnson_210813_4713_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A leads the charge in a variety of early Black Friday deals from Google.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6ej8I"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/collection/offers?hl=en-US"&gt;launched its early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a lot to like if you’re in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShDHRU"&gt;By now there are many great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to consider, and in addition to our retailer-specific roundups for sales at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re starved for ideas on what to shop for, we also have a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;gift guides&lt;/a&gt; for you to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9bWFH"&gt;In the meantime, we have highlighted all the worthwhile Google deals below — such as &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;$50 off the budget-friendly Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_audio?hl=en-US"&gt;$40 off the excellent Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;Stadia Premiere Edition bundle for just $22&lt;/a&gt;. Check out all there is on offer directly from Google and other retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fBqnn3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Z9hn2U"&gt;Pixel deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BsYXJD"&gt;The Pixel 5A is the latest midrange phone from Google, released in the summer before the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro started to mix things up. It doesn’t offer Google’s custom-designed processor like the Pixel 6, but its Snapdragon 765G chip, IP67 rating, and friendly price tag give this “boring” phone ample performance. Google dropped the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 5A down to just $399 for Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, offering a strong value proposition with that $50 discount. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="B1ZWOf"&gt;Chromecast deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="hYd0Ds"&gt;Google’s latest streaming stick, the Chromecast with Google TV, comes with a handy remote and is now $10 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FChromecast-with-Google-TV%2F403830906%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-chromecast-with-google-tv%2F-%2FA-81563926%3Fpreselect%3D80173812%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It makes for a solid streaming option at just $40 and is one of our favorites. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="m9MImc"&gt;Even the basic Chromecast, which is a little older, is $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00439-US-Chromecast-3rd-Generation/dp/B015UKRNGS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Chromecast-3rd-Gen%2F435188866%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LynNnW5u" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-chromecast-charcoal-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54010906%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a solid option at $20, but if you can afford to spend more, we strongly advise springing for the newer model with Google TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xeHdOZ"&gt;Nest displays and speakers deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Xqi4nQ"&gt;Google’s second-gen Nest Hub, one of the best cloud-connected digital photo frames you can buy, is half off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1K8HEDXXz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Chalk%2F619753146&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D80209776%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the second-gen model isn’t the biggest upgrade over the original, for just $50, this smart speaker and its seven-inch display offer a lot for your connected home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="GnnfcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="6q7TQK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="s9fdGa"&gt;If you prefer to supersize all the displays in your life, you can get the Nest Hub Max for $50 off at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LB56siPj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max%2F-%2FA-78295230%3Fpreselect%3D76500131%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the smart speaker with a 10-inch display down to $179. Sure, that’s a lot more than the cost of its smaller sibling, but the larger size really helps with readability and sound quality. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nukcYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="5WclDY"&gt;The Google Nest Audio is one of the more recent additions to Google’s line of smart home devices, and for $40, we cannot recommend it enough. This diminutive speaker — which is on sale right now for $60 at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_audio?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079%3Fpreselect%3D80209773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1SFFXAfi7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — produces bigger sound than you might think. At its current price, you could pick up two and pair them in stereo, giving you room-filling sound for $20 more than the normal price of a single unit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="36oHjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872990"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Lgy80K"&gt;Need a simple smart speaker for listening to music and controlling your home? The minuscule Nest Mini is currently $24 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal%2F741412707%3Fathbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-78589456%3Fpreselect%3D76500134%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to just $25. It’s one of the easiest ways to add Google Assistant to your home, comes in a variety of fun colors, and sounds much better than the Google Home Mini that came before it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="SnQGkp"&gt;The latest iteration of Google’s battery-powered Nest Doorbell is $50 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_doorbell_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Video-Doorbell-Camera-Wireless-Doorbell-Security-Camera-Linen%2F983055336&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L0G8uYpV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery%2F-%2FA-84283100%3Fpreselect%3D82685731%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. At $130, the Nest Doorbell is a solid option if you prefer not to futz around with hardwiring, and it comes in an array of muted colors so you can best match the exterior of your home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="NWPNjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873038"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XQjdTT"&gt;Google’s older Nest Doorbell, which does require hardwiring, is $80 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Wired%2F381881630%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L6cm1smu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired%2F-%2FA-52629447%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $149. This option may be worthwhile if you prefer a smart video doorbell that is always powered and doesn’t require you to charge it. We do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expect a new model in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a great price on a long-standing product from Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="0nA11R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XorsEo"&gt;The new battery-powered Google Nest Cam that can be indoors or outdoors is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1NSwELA5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-indoor-outdoor-cam-battery%2F-%2FA-82685730%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. This drops the price to $150 during the shopping holiday, making the Nest Cam a little more appealing. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we mentioned how we were left a little disappointed by the video quality but praised the camera’s handsome robot-like design, which should fit well in any home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1TwRvm"&gt;If you’re looking to cover multiple angles of your home, inside or out, you can also stack up extra savings on the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Cam at the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, you can buy a two-pack for $50 off ($280 total) or a four-pack for $100 off ($560 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DLYK93"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873328"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dHZX8L"&gt;Possibly the most appealing, and certainly most unique, Nest Cam is the new outdoor wired model with a floodlight. You can get this brightly illuminated one for $50 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Cam-with-Floodlight-Snow%2F386164023&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1N0uvdGbE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-cam-with-floodlight%2F-%2FA-83702962%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the most affordable way to get a smart thermostat from Google’s Nest line, outside of getting one through your electrical company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="AvOAKH"&gt;The latest generation of the Nest Learning Thermostat, the model that automatically learns your habits and helped kick-start the smart thermostat craze, is $70 off for Black Friday at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNest-Smart-Learning-Thermostat-3rd-Generation%2F46667636%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1Oc1QH6I4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat%2F-%2FA-52586860%3Fpreselect%3D49163945%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you want one of the most robust thermostats around, $179 is about as good as it gets. And if you have a larger house or building that requires multiple thermostats, you can get a two-pack for &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen_bundle?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 off from Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="aVYM0Y"&gt;Switching to the safer side of things, a three-pack of Nest Protect smart smoke alarms is &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_protect_2nd_gen_three_pack_bundle?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$28 off at Google&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="9S66KC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LwG7Ur"&gt;Nest Wifi deals&lt;/h2&gt;

This includes the router and one mesh point, letting you extend the signal and tailor it to your own space or home layout.

And for much larger homes, Google is also offering &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off a Nest router with two points&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $249. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fkpE4N"&gt;Stadia deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RcdykR"&gt;If you have been wanting to try out Google’s Stadia game streaming service, the early Black Friday deal on the Stadia Premiere Edition is the absolute best option possible. &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This bundle from the Google Store consists of a white Stadia controller and 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra streaming puck for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $57. That’s 73 percent off the usual $80 price! It’s a pretty wild deal, offering a lot of value. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Discord now lets you send up to 10 (accessible) memes at a time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aXjN3uWTUzTmzTg2vuZJooLOURw=/0x0:989x659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164529/Discord_47Z2dGAzDg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new alt text feature in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Discord&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Onzd9E"&gt;Discord has updated its Windows and macOS desktop clients to let users add alt text for image attachments, the service &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1461442402917359618"&gt;has announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a helpful accessibility feature for users that rely on screen readers and arrives alongside the ability to preview and upload up to 10 files at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iikH2v"&gt;The alt text accessibility feature can be found by clicking the small pen icon (“Modify Attachment”) on the top right of each individual preview before sending it in a text channel. Of course, the feature relies on people making the effort to manually add alt text in order for it to be useful. But it’s better than not having the option at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8niMl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;big upgrades to attachments: now you can upload up to 10 files at a time on desktop, see previews, and add alt text for ppl with screen readers (plus a few more things). pretty big. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rptaHdlCem"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rptaHdlCem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Discord (@discord) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1461442402917359618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="coSFer"&gt;Alt text support joins a number of other accessibility features Discord has added to its desktop apps in recent months. Other quality of life improvements include keyboard support for drag and drop, allowing users to organize their servers and channels without needing to use a mouse, and a slider that changes the speed of its text-to-speech feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTV8jt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox app for Windows finally solves game install headaches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jyqpy7-DHaNPw72dWOfRojubTI4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164389/Xbox_App_Preview_11_17_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbFYla"&gt;Microsoft is now allowing testers to access a new Xbox app for Windows that greatly improves the game install process from the Windows store. As we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776024/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-folder-install-uwp-options"&gt;reported earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the updated app allows PC gamers to install titles into any folder of their choice with unrestricted access to game files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWmQT"&gt;It’s an option that helps address many of the headaches of installing titles from Xbox Game Pass for PC, and it should also mean you can backup game files and restore them if need be. Previously, Microsoft forced games to install into a WindowsApps folder at the root of a drive, and it was locked down so you couldn’t modify files or freely move them around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_kXLNPIu8qLH5HRoWb1ZQFs0PIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026938/dKIC0Le.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now get options to manage where games are installed to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BxuIsB"&gt;The updated Xbox app now lets you choose a location, and, if you have existing games installed, you can move them onto secondary drives. I’ve tested the app and successfully moved &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;onto secondary drives. I can now fully access those files and folders, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDbZ9N"&gt;Windows 10 and Windows 11 users can test the new Xbox app through the Xbox Insider Hub app from the store. You’ll need to join the “Windows Gaming” preview within the Xbox Insider Hub app to get the updated Xbox app. Microsoft does &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/18/advanced-installation-and-management-features-available-for-insiders-through-the-xbox-app-for-windows/"&gt;list a number of known issues&lt;/a&gt; for this early release though, including issues launching some games on external drives and a number of games that aren’t supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMyu9e"&gt;You also still can’t add games downloaded from the Windows store into Steam, as there appears to be a permission issue preventing that. The Xbox app is still in preview, so that could be a bug that will be addressed before it’s widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwKWQD"&gt;Either way, Windows store game installs are finally getting more Steam-like, after years of issues and bugs for PC users. If you’ve been avoiding Xbox Game Pass for PC due to the Windows store, this new Xbox app should remove some of the associated headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is paying musicians and creators up to $50,000 to use its live audio features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FR9fgumBj6VJf5OiXE9ojWJCmLQ=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164377/Live_Audio_Rooms_Rooms_Discovery_Stars_and_Fundraising_Side_by_Side.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook launched its Live Audio Rooms feature (above) to rival once-buzzy app Clubhouse. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mj6R0G"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta continues its tactic of buying buzz, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in July that the company would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; to creators by the end of 2022. A report &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; details how some of this money is being spent, with Meta-owned Facebook paying creators up to $50,000 to use the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt; feature — a rival to the once-buzzy live audio app Clubhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdYGIT"&gt;When you make as much money as Meta does, buying success is a reasonable tactic, at least in the short term. The Meta-owned Instagram, for example, has been doing the same to boost its TikTok-rival Reels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;paying creators up to $35,000&lt;/a&gt; to post to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X2330R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta promised to pay creators $1 billion by the end of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJPDjw"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, the terms for using Live Audio Rooms are similarly generous. “Facebook is offering to pay musicians and other creators $10,000 to $50,000 per session on its five-month-old live audio product, plus a fee for guests of $10,000 or more,” says the publication, citing “people with direct knowledge of deal terms.” For this money, Facebook reportedly wants creators to host four to six sessions at least 30 minutes in length. Live Audio Rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;launched in the US in June&lt;/a&gt;, with the feature sitting alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394215/facebook-soundbites-audio-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;other audio-focused products&lt;/a&gt; like podcasts, music, and short-form “Soundbites.” Established names who’ve appeared on Live Audio Rooms include singer Miley Cyrus and comedian Sherry Cola, though there’s no reporting that these individuals were paid to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WM6mEw"&gt;You may have the impression that only Meta needs to pay creators to use its platform, but really this behavior is common across the entire industry (Meta just has deeper pockets than most). TikTok has its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/the-tiktok-creator-fund-is-now-live-across-europe-and-here-is-how-to-apply"&gt;Creator Fund&lt;/a&gt;, Snap has its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/"&gt;Spotlight program&lt;/a&gt;, and Twitter has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators"&gt;paid “accelerator” program&lt;/a&gt; for its audio feature Spaces. Indeed, pretty much every major platform offers financial incentives of some sort to attract and retain talent. The only question is who will stay when the money runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Twitter got research right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjMsR1S8NaTfHxx9yQtd7ldliWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164337/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zug8T1"&gt;It has not been a happy time for researchers at big tech companies. Hired to help executives understand platforms’ shortcomings, research teams inevitably reveal inconvenient truths. Companies hire teams to build “responsible AI” but bristle when their employees discover algorithmic bias. They boast about the quality of their internal research but disavow it when it makes its way to the press. At Google, this story played out in &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;the forced departure of ethical AI researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent fallout for her team. At Facebook, it led to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Frances Haugen and the Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4DGna"&gt;For these reasons, it’s always of note when a tech platform takes one of those unflattering findings and publishes it for the world to see. At the end of October, Twitter did just that. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/22/twitter-admits-bias-in-algorithm-for-rightwing-politicians-and-news-outlets"&gt;Dan Milmo in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mcVGqF"&gt;Twitter has admitted it amplifies more tweets from right-wing politicians and news outlets than content from left-wing sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qEGLJ"&gt;The social media platform examined tweets from elected officials in seven countries – the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and Japan. It also studied whether political content from news organisations was amplified on Twitter, focusing primarily on US news sources such as Fox News, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHWlw6"&gt;The research found that in six out of seven countries, apart from Germany, tweets from right-wing politicians received more amplification from the algorithm than those from the left; right-leaning news organisations were more amplified than those on the left; and generally politicians’ tweets were more amplified by an algorithmic timeline than by the chronological timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HNMZKC"&gt;Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/rml-politicalcontent"&gt;blog post on the subject&lt;/a&gt; was accompanied by &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/blog-twitter/official/en_us/company/2021/rml/Algorithmic-Amplification-of-Politics-on-Twitter.pdf"&gt;a 27-page paper&lt;/a&gt; that further describes the study’s findings and research and methodology. It wasn’t the first time this year that the company had volunteered empirical support for years-old, speculative criticism of its work. This summer, Twitter hosted an open competition to find bias in its photo-cropping algorithms. James Vincent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617972/twitter-photo-cropping-algorithm-ai-bias-bug-bounty-results"&gt;described the results at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RVCZhr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/bogdan-kulynych/saliency_bias"&gt;top-placed entry&lt;/a&gt; showed that Twitter’s cropping algorithm favors faces that are “slim, young, of light or warm skin color and smooth skin texture, and with stereotypically feminine facial traits.” The second and third-placed entries showed that the system was &lt;a href="https://github.com/erickmu1/Twitter-Algorithmic-Bias"&gt;biased against people with white or grey hair&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting age discrimination, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/royapakzad/image-crop-analysis"&gt;favors English over Arabic script in images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GneboW"&gt;These results were not hidden in a closed chat group, never to be discussed. Instead, Rumman Chowdhury — who leads machine learning ethics and responsibility at Twitter — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLwdzLiJywI"&gt;presented them publicly at DEF CON&lt;/a&gt; and praised participants for helping to illustrate the real-world effects of algorithmic bias. The winners were paid for their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSpO4o"&gt;On one hand, I don’t want to overstate Twitter’s bravery here. The results the company published, while opening it up to some criticisms, are nothing that is going to result in a full Congressional investigation. And the fact that the company is much smaller than Google or Facebook parent Meta, which both serve billions of people, means that anything found by its researchers is less likely to trigger a global firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY2895"&gt;At the same time, Twitter doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do this kind of public-interest work. And in the long run, I do believe it will make the company stronger and more valuable. But it would be relatively easy for any company executive or board member to make a case against doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsT4JZ"&gt;For that reason, I’ve been eager to talk to the team responsible for it. This week, I met virtually with Chowdhury and Jutta Williams, product lead for Chowdhury’s team. (Inconveniently, as of&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html"&gt; October 28th&lt;/a&gt;: the Twitter team’s official name is Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability: META.) I wanted to know more about how Twitter is doing this work, how it has been received internally, and where it’s going next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVIKsz"&gt;Here’s some of what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkHRZw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter is betting that public participation will accelerate and improve its findings&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the more unusual aspects of Twitter’s AI ethics research is that it is paying outside volunteer researchers to participate. Chowdhury was trained as an ethical hacker and observed that her friends working in cybersecurity are often able to protect systems more nimbly by creating financial incentives for people to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T022FV"&gt;“Twitter was the first time that I was actually able to work at an organization that was visible and impactful enough to do this and also ambitious enough to fund it,” said Chowdhury, who joined the company a year ago when it acquired her AI risk management startup. “It’s hard to find that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yviwWk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Often, only the loudest voices are addressed, while major problems are left to linger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1WZeIL"&gt;It’s typically difficult to get good feedback from the public about algorithmic bias, Chowdhury told me. Often, only the loudest voices are addressed, while major problems are left to linger because affected groups don’t have contacts at platforms who can address them. Other times, issues are diffuse through the population, and individual users may not feel the negative effects directly. (Privacy tends to be an issue like that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b39V4L"&gt;Twitter’s bias bounty helped the company build a system to solicit and implement that feedback, Chowdhury told me. The company has since announced it will stop cropping photos in previews after its algorithms were found to largely favor the young, white, and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAmzou"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsible AI is hard in part because no one understands fully understands decisions made by algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;. Ranking algorithms in social feeds are probabilistic — they show you things based on how likely you are to like, share, or comment on them. But there’s no one algorithm making that decision — it’s typically a mesh of multiple (sometimes dozens) of different models, each making guesses that are then weighted differently according to ever-shifting factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qop5FK"&gt;That’s a major reason why it’s so difficult to confidently build AI systems that are “responsible” — there is simply a lot of guesswork involved. Chowdhury pointed out the difference here between working on responsible AI and cybersecurity. In security, she said, it’s usually possible to unwind why the system is vulnerable, so long as you can discover where the attacker entered it. But in responsible AI, finding a problem often doesn’t tell you much about what created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3sYdW"&gt;That’s the case with the company’s research on amplifying right-wing voices, for example. Twitter is confident that the phenomenon is real but can only theorize as to the reasons behind it. It may be something in the algorithm. But it might also be a user behavior — maybe right-wing politicians tend to tweet in a way to elicit more comments, for example, which then causes their tweets to be weighted more heavily by Twitter’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnoQQc"&gt;“There’s this law of unintended consequences to large systems,” said Williams, who previously worked at Google and Facebook. “It could be so many different things. How we’ve weighted algorithmic recommendation may be a part of it. But it wasn’t intended to be a consequence of political affiliation. So there’s so much research to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZqQFo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no real consensus on what ranking algorithms “should” do&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if Twitter does solve the mystery of what’s causing right-wing content to spread more widely, it won’t be clear what the company should do about it. What if, for example, the answer lies not in the algorithm but in the behavior of certain accounts? If right-wing politicians simply generate more comments than left-wing politicians, there may not be an obvious intervention for Twitter to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZomK2G"&gt;“I don’t think anybody wants us to be in the business of forcing some sort of social engineering of people’s voices,” Chowdhury told me. “But also, we all agree that we don’t want amplification of negative content or toxic content or unfair political bias. So these are all things that I would love for us to be unpacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuXEYG"&gt;That conversation should be held publicly, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqW9Am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter thinks algorithms can be saved&lt;/strong&gt;. One possible response to the idea that all our social feeds are unfathomably complex and cannot be explained by their creators is that we should shut them down and delete the code. Congress now regularly introduces bills that would make ranking algorithms illegal, or make platforms legally liable for what they recommend, or force platforms to let people opt out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkQwRq"&gt;Twitter’s team, for one, believes that ranking has a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYK6LT"&gt;“The algorithm is something that can be saved,” Williams said. “The algorithm needs to be understood. And the &lt;em&gt;inputs&lt;/em&gt; to the algorithm need to be something that everybody can manage and control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQXO22"&gt;With any luck, Twitter will build just that kind of system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD3e7x"&gt;Of course, the risk in writing a piece like this is that, in my experience, teams like this are fragile. One minute, leadership is pleased with its findings and enthusiastically hiring for it; the next, it’s withering by attrition amidst budget cuts or reorganized out of existence amidst personality conflicts or regulatory concerns. Twitter’s early success with META is promising, but META’s long-term future is not assured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abz6qo"&gt;In the meantime, the work is likely to get harder. Twitter is now actively at work on a project to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/twitter-taps-crypto-developer-to-lead-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-effort/"&gt;make its network decentralized&lt;/a&gt;, which could shield parts of the network from its own efforts to build the network more responsibly. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also envisioned an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms"&gt;app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;,” giving users more choice around how their feeds are ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W4LoNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not sure it’s feasible for us to jump right into a marketplace of algorithms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ah0YTg"&gt;It’s difficult enough to rank &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; feed responsibly — what it means to make a whole app store of algorithms “responsible” will be a much larger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zVhn2"&gt;“I’m not sure it’s feasible for us to jump right into a marketplace of algorithms,” Williams said. “But I do think it’s possible for our algorithm to understand signal that’s curated by you. So if there’s profanity in a tweet, as an example: how sensitive are you to that kind of language? Are there specific words that you would consider very, very profane and you don’t want to see? How do we give you controls for you to establish what your preferences are so that that signal can be used in any kind of recommendation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr7GPp"&gt;“I think that there’s a third-party signal more than there is a third-party bunch of algorithms,” Williams said. “You have to be careful about what’s in an algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter stops opening links in AMP on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5nTGmtbTqPI7Nzn4DaMquqnFfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164308/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHPCJj"&gt;Twitter has quietly rolled back its support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) on mobile, according to a &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/amp/overview"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/christian_wilde/status/1460929280486031367"&gt;SEO consultant Christian Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;. The support page originally detailed how Twitter would automatically send users of its mobile apps to the AMP version of a page from links posted on the social network. However, at some point since October 21st, Twitter updated the page with a notice saying it’s retiring the feature by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXGXTT"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/twitter-rolls-back-amp-support-no-longer-sends-users-to-amp-pages-376168"&gt;to data from &lt;em&gt;SearchEngineLand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this retirement process appears to have been completed earlier this month. Now, attempting to visit a page from Twitter appears to send users directly to the regular web page, rather than an AMP version that may be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWBnkMaf-RAycN4vl1V27C_A_6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026927/msedge_OX1DnKyNyR.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s notice saying it’s retiring the AMP feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pXWd2B"&gt;Although Twitter notes that the AMP allows for “fast-loading, beautiful, high-performing mobile web experiences,” the technology has proved controversial since Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467149/google-accelerated-mobile-pages-caching-preview"&gt;introduced it in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the controversy centered around Google’s perceived control of the project, with some critics claiming that it amounted to Google’s attempt to &lt;a href="http://ampletter.org/"&gt;reinforce its control of the open web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjzIJn"&gt;But it also has more basic user interface problems for a platform like Twitter because of the way it can mess with URLs, when it makes pages appear to be from Google regardless of the website that created them. It’s an annoying situation that’s led to the creation of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;browser extensions which&lt;/a&gt; automatically redirect AMP pages to the original article URL to reduce confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWmGCh"&gt;Twitter’s support document doesn’t give a reason for its change in policy. A spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmMM0n"&gt;The social network’s move follows a policy change from Google itself in May 2020 when it announced that it would &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/amp-wont-be-required-for-googles-top-stories-section-335276"&gt;no longer require news sites&lt;/a&gt; to offer AMP versions of their pages in order to be featured in its search engine’s Top Stories section. The move was a long time coming following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095078/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-page-announcement-standard-web-packaging-urls"&gt;Google initiative launched in May 2018&lt;/a&gt; to take what the company had learned from AMP and turn its features into general web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHRvND"&gt;For more background on AMP, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17898006/google-amp-future-malte-uble-interview-vergecast"&gt;2018 episode of The Vergecast&lt;/a&gt; featuring an interview with AMP’s former tech lead Malte Ubl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s Grappleshot helps make the familiar feel new</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rga-H7rdmc3qs6nSTj9YVOaiikE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164175/8KMUico.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Halo Infinite is a familiar but different Halo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f5Zasn"&gt;I wasn’t ready to start sneaking around a Banished warship in my first few minutes in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign, but there I was facing down an army of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites. The initial thrill of the classic &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;music and the familiarity of the enemies was a nostalgia overload for a good few minutes, but after it all wore off I noticed the new Grappleshot. Oh, boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzaTPE"&gt;I first played &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; 20 years ago, and while the combination of grenades, melees, and an assortment of weapons and vehicles still remains today, the Grappleshot is an entirely new addition that transforms the campaign mode. It’s an ideal companion that left me excited and wanting to upgrade it fully during my first few hours of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMSLZ6PC8dB1lFIvTSCrddAVIHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024291/grappleshot.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Grappleshot Jackal shields to kill them easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvnfDF"&gt;You’re introduced to the Grappleshot in the early missions in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, as you fight your way outside toward the open areas of the Zeta Halo that the Banished enemies have taken over. The first level is incredibly vertical, and it acts like a subtle training mode to gently nudge you into mastering the Grappleshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdpsSV"&gt;While you can run, jump, and shoot enemies freely without it, zip lining toward a Brute and punching them in the face is incredibly satisfying. If Jackal’s shields are annoying, just Grappleshot the shield to force them to lower it. It’s also great for instantly figuring out those “How do I get up there?” moments, where you can just aim and transport yourself to areas that would be impossible to get to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzzwXY"&gt;I’ve been playing around with the Grappleshot for months during the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer previews, and I was impressed with its mobility there, but it has unlimited uses in the campaign. That means it really comes into its own. You can use it to navigate around quicker or to propel yourself toward an enemy, and it can also be used to retrieve items like guns or fusion coils. There’s only a short cooldown in the campaign mode, so the possibilities for speed running are going to be endless. I can’t wait to witness what talented players manage to accomplish here.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N02jXTW4lN_cr_pIwmVsSN7rMaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024268/halozeta.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One part of the Zeta Halo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="djao5x"&gt;The dark and eerie areas in the first few missions of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;where you’re first introduced to the Grappleshot are what you’d expect from classic &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a clear storyline and structure, and plenty of Banished enemies to eliminate. If you’re new to the franchise, the story itself takes place 18 months after the events of &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;, but the story and adventures really start to expand once you first venture outside onto the Zeta Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK7HQj"&gt;It’s here where &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; really sets itself apart from &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;games that have come before it. It still maintains a very &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved &lt;/em&gt;look and feel, but you can freely explore the Zeta Halo, and it’s filled with items to discover, high-value targets to eliminate, outposts to conquer, and of course areas of the main storyline to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvBQTz9FI22213So84El-W6POeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024294/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_11_18_14_23_19.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zeta Halo surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kVbGGw"&gt;While it certainly looks and feels like an open-world &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game at first glance, 343 Industries limits the areas of Zeta Halo you can explore until you’ve progressed and unlocked new areas. It’s difficult to tell right now exactly how big this map will be, but you can pan around and get a sense that there’s plenty to unlock. It certainly sounds vast, and I had to spend a few minutes simply standing still and appreciating the subtle audio of the environment and animals that surrounded me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOeXLR"&gt;You can also earn armor upgrades, improve your Grappleshot abilities, and much more here. I only experienced a few upgrades during my initial preview of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, but there are upgrades to stun grappled enemies for several seconds, reduce the Grappleshot cooldown by 40 percent, deliver a shockwave blast when holding melee while you grapple, and even increase the radius of the shockwave blast. I can’t wait to unlock all of these options and see how truly powerful the Grappleshot can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03v-pk1xkHTlnVHqLfT8CJPDn7U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024230/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_11_18_13_50_18.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grappleshot upgrades look promising.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Wk8h7"&gt;While you can explore the Halo Zeta surface and discover occasional skirmishes and battles, the first main campaign mission here is to infiltrate a huge tower that houses a Banished boss. It’s a dark, steam-filled location that really demonstrates just how good &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;looks running on the Xbox Series X, with lighting that requires you to activate a light on Master Chief’s helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMg78r"&gt;Out of all the initial missions in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, I enjoyed this one the most and it left me wanting more. The boss battle introduces you to the threat sensor, a projectile you can use to track enemies through walls and terrain. The threat sensor is particularly useful against enemies that like to cloak and hide away, and you’ll find high-value targets out in the Halo Zeta that do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjOTE4FhYNQ7I45pG22GBQPvLtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024250/Qi6iPb5.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite starts out dark, eerie, and steam-filled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yYCiqs"&gt;You can choose to equip the threat sensor when you need it in place of the Grappleshot, and I’m curious to see how the campaign progresses to unlock extra equipment and abilities. The progression system works through Spartan Cores, which can be found throughout the main campaign missions or across Zeta Halo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewxGY9"&gt;Once you unlock more vehicles, you can also summon them freely from outposts that you’ve secured. You have to battle Banished forces to capture outposts, following their six-month occupation of the Ring. These outposts reveal new Banished structures, extra high-value targets, and you can use them to rally UNSC Marines who are willing to accompany you on missions and defeat enemies. If you rescue marines out in the field or capture Banished bases, you’ll also earn Valor — a resource that lets you unlock new weapons, vehicles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTs4Qu"&gt;I’ve only played the first few hours of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; so far, and it already feels like there are many hours ahead of me. The Weapon, a new AI that bares a striking resemblance to Cortana, is introduced early on, and the fate of Master Chief and Cortana’s role in the story are still very much up in the air after just a few hours of gameplay. We’ll have a full review of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; next month, where we’ll find out just how big Zeta Halo is and discover the secrets hidden within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="yCVwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; already feels like a familiar but different kind of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and one that fans are going to enjoy exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
