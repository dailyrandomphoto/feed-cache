    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On the Blink&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tg6d49"&gt;Blink, the Kickstarter success bought by Amazon in 2017, has long been synonymous with inexpensive battery-powered home video cameras that don’t require a monthly contract for cloud recordings. Open-source projects like &lt;a href="https://homebridge.io/"&gt;Homebridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hoobs.org/"&gt;HOOBS&lt;/a&gt; have made the cameras even more extensible by allowing Blink’s temperature and motion sensors to work with smart home platforms like HomeKit and act as triggers for various automations. This combination of price and functionality led many smart home enthusiasts to buy Blink cameras in bulk for whole-home monitoring, especially those who don’t want to be beholden to a corporate overlord (and its requisite subscription fees). But instead of embracing its most passionate fans, Amazon has turned against them, threatening to terminate Blink accounts while challenging the very concept of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXEB61"&gt;To set the stage, I recently set up a Raspberry Pi running Homebridge with the goal of creating a single iPhone dashboard to tie my smart home together. I started automating my home about 12 years ago, long before you could buy into complete ecosystems from Amazon, Google, and Apple. Now it’s a devil’s brew of Z-Wave and Zigbee devices, some controllable with Siri, some with Alexa, and a few with Google Assistant. It’s held together with a smattering of IFTTT recipes and four disparate hubs from Ikea, Aqara, Philips Hue, and Vera. It works, kind of, but requires several different apps, many interfaces, and lots of patience, especially from my family. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A_yRo74edoTvcAxGgT5OS7R0Jq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440361/blink_garden_exposed.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homebridge turns this Blink XT outdoor camera into a temperature and motion trigger for other automations in Apple’s Home app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WVC13j"&gt;Over most of a weekend, I was able to configure Homebridge to link every one of my 50+ smart devices to HomeKit and each other in the Apple Home app. This allowed me to create rules that were previously impossible, like using the Blink XT camera’s motion sensor in my garden to trigger a Z-Wave siren and Hue lightbulbs at night. Nerdvana unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LofxYN"&gt;My sense of delight and intense pride lasted exactly one week before my Blink cameras suddenly went dead. The reason was delivered in an email from Amazon the next morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ph6qdh"&gt;“My name is Tori and I am with the Blink team. While doing a routine server audit, your account was flagged and subsequently disabled due to unsupported scripts or apps running on your system. The only automation that is permitted for use with the Blink system is through Alexa and/or IFTTT. Please disable these scripts or apps and reach back out to me so that I can re-enable your account.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cbeK1d"&gt;After a brief WTF exchange whereby I explained that Alexa and / or IFTTT are wholly inferior to the capabilities of Homebridge, Tori helpfully directed me to the exact paragraph of the Blink Terms of Service that I had violated. Terms which, admittedly, I was now reading for the first time (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5Vh6Nh"&gt;“We may terminate the Agreement or restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of Blink Services at our discretion without notice at any time, including if we determine that your use violates the Agreement, is improper, &lt;strong&gt;substantially exceeds or differs from normal use by other users&lt;/strong&gt;, or otherwise involves fraud or misuse of Blink Services or harms our interests or those of another user of Blink Services. If your use of Blink Services is restricted, suspended, or terminated, you may be unable to access your video clips and you will not receive any refund or any other compensation. In case of termination, Blink may immediately revoke your access to Blink Services without refund.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bsvLBE"&gt;It turns out that Amazon’s crackdown on Blink automators has been a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/comments/dpswdf/dont_use_blink_camera_homebridge_plugins/"&gt;known issue&lt;/a&gt; in the community for at least a year. My question is: why does Amazon bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcuRVA"&gt;My Homebridge integration may well be in violation of Blink’s terms and conditions, even if the terms seem unduly restrictive. But why is Amazon, owner of those massive AWS server farms that earned nearly $50 billion in 2020, resorting to such draconian measures in response to my meager deployment of five Blink cameras? I could see a crackdown on large-scale corporate installations hammering away at the Blink API, but why me and other small-time enthusiasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juxEcm"&gt;According to Colin Bendell, developer of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/colinbendell/homebridge-blink-for-home"&gt;Blink camera plugin for Homebridge&lt;/a&gt;, there are at most 4,000 homes using open-source plugins like his. “Even if we round up to 10,000 users, I think this is probably small potatoes for Amazon,” says Bendell, who should know. Not only did he reverse engineer the Blink app to mimic its behavior, but the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oreilly.com%2Flibrary%2Fview%2Fhigh-performance-images%2F9781491925799%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22381356%2Fblink-homebridge-crackdown-amazon-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;O’Reilly author&lt;/a&gt; and self-proclaimed IoT hobbyist is also the director of performance engineering at Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe6NTe"&gt;Blink could easily look the other way for small home deployments like mine without waving its rights. It says so right in the T&amp;amp;Cs it sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dAX92T"&gt;“Blink’s failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y2fkH5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon should be embracing Blink hobbyists, not vilifying them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Gn6U"&gt;But that’d be a cop out. Really, Amazon should be embracing Blink hobbyists. Homebridge is, after all, a project that extends Apple HomeKit to work with a wide variety of uncertified devices including cameras and doorbells from Amazon-owned Ring. And study after study have concluded that Apple device owners love to spend money. Surely this is a community Amazon should encourage, not vilify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roAQw4"&gt;At the risk of saying too much (please don’t shut me down, Amazon!), why is it that my two Ring cameras aren’t raising any red flags during “server audits”? I certainly check them more frequently as one is my doorbell. Perhaps it’s because I already pay a monthly subscription to Amazon for Ring and pay nothing to Blink. (Although sadly, even that early benefit has come to an end. As of March 18th, Amazon requires owners of newer Blink cameras to &lt;a href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/before-you-begin/blink-storage-options"&gt;pay a subscription fee&lt;/a&gt; to unlock every feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5M3tB"&gt;When I reached out to Amazon with the questions I raise above, and asked if enthusiast initiatives like Homebridge would be officially (or unofficially, &lt;em&gt;wink&lt;/em&gt;) supported, I was given this boilerplate response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16W8vE"&gt;“Blink customers can control their cameras through the Blink Home Monitor app, and customize their experience using the If This Then That (IFTTT) service. We are always looking for ways to improve the customer experience, including supporting select third-party integrations for our devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOhrMk"&gt;Gee, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuT2G6C3f7CEa9PnLpLG-3AHPoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440365/no_monthly_contract_blink.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Blink’s biggest advantages has come to an end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CVEVR3"&gt;We kid ourselves about ownership all the time. I say I own my house, but, in fact, the bank owns more of it than I do. I listen to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt; on Spotify, but those Premium playlists I’ve so carefully curated for years will be plucked from my phone just as soon as payments lapse. But somehow, Blink cameras were supposed to be different. They were for people drawn to Blink on the strength of that “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqitP0llkL0"&gt;no monthly contract&lt;/a&gt;” pitch. These were devices you were supposed to own without limitations or tithes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Jkv5S"&gt;How things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvbMES"&gt;In 2017, Blink stood alone in the field; today there’s Wyze, Eufy, TP-Link / Kasa, Imou, and Ezviz to name just a few of the companies making inexpensive wired and wireless cameras for every smart home ecosystem, including Amazon’s, often with better features and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NiJvzC"&gt;I’ve been a smart home evangelist for more than a decade, doling out advice to friends, often solicited, often not. Blink used to be an easy pitch: cheap and dead simple to install for normies, and highly extensible if you’re willing to put in the effort. But Amazon’s heavy-handed enforcement of T&amp;amp;Cs alongside the introduction of subscription fees have negated any advantage Blink once held over its camera competitors. While Blink sales will undoubtedly benefit from Amazon’s promotion machine, longtime Blink enthusiasts like myself will be taking their allegiances elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stromer ST2 e-bike review: too hot for Europe</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great speed pedelec hamstrung by EU regulations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mJSPk1"&gt;The words “Swiss design” conjure images of luxury watch movements and delicately sculpted eyeglasses, not hulking e-bikes with thickly welded frames and face-melting power. Stromer is here to challenge those assumptions and force a rethink of how its Swiss-made electric bikes, with top speeds of 45 km/h (28 mph), can disrupt urban transportation for the benefit of residents. I’ve certainly seen the light after testing a new 2021 edition ST2, Stromer’s first e-bike with a carbon belt drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07crmH"&gt;Broadly speaking, US cities have all of the fast e-bikes and no bicycle infrastructure, whereas European cities have all of the protective infrastructure and few fast e-bikes. It’s exceedingly rare to see fast e-bikes known as speed-pedelecs in my Amsterdam home, for example, where half of all new bikes sold are electric, and bicycles outnumber people by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8V4PL"&gt;It’s not that EU bike makers are an effete bunch of cheese-eating milquetoasts; they manufacture slow, underpowered e-bikes to avoid the draconian measures triggered by EU Directive 168/2013. It states that any e-bike that goes faster than 25 km/h (15.5 mph) with a continuous rated power above 250 watts is to be treated the same as a gas-guzzling moped. Makers of s-pedelecs like the Stromer ST2 are subjected to a grueling certification process that then requires owners to hold a moped-class driver’s license, liability insurance, and registration. By contrast, a similarly specced Class 3 e-bike in the US usually requires... nothing, other than a helmet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRpZmd"&gt;Regulating speed-pedelecs is a good thing, but they should be specifically targeted and not just shoe-horned into existing rules that curtail adoption, stifle innovation, and increase costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ebBr7"&gt;To make matters worse, speed pedelecs are banned from riding on the vast majority of the ubiquitous bike lanes that famously protect helmet-less Dutch bicyclists in cities like Amsterdam. Why? Because mopeds are banned, and the law doesn’t differentiate. &lt;em&gt;Fuck that.&lt;/em&gt; I wasn’t going to put my life at risk for this review by riding alongside heavy (and dangerous) automobiles just because European regulators can’t get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbSAdP"&gt;Over the entirety of March, I spent my days fawning over the sophistication of the Stromer ST2 while fuming at lawmakers for holding back s-pedelecs from their full potential as car replacements. While I’ll be reviewing the ST2 on its own merits, it’s nigh impossible to recommend to Europeans without first considering the operational rules by which it’s constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JA2W3L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10447591"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJUKSW"&gt;Before diving too deeply into why European rules suck, let’s start with what makes the new Stromer ST2 so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LFaJ6"&gt;The ST2 is Stromer’s all-rounder model in a &lt;a href="https://www.stromerbike.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/mystromertechsheetmy21produktmatrixneurzv2en.pdf"&gt;range of s-pedelecs&lt;/a&gt; that run from the entry-level ST1 to the ST5 (there is no ST4), with prices ranging from $4,199 / €4,628 to $11,699 / €11,428 and higher depending on configuration and options. Stromer’s motors range from 670W and 35 Nm of torque to 850W and 48 Nm. All Stromers are pedal-assisted e-bikes without throttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzYzz2"&gt;The ST2 starts at $5,699 / €6,128 and is fitted with a 750-watt Stromer CYRO Drive IG motor mounted on the rear hub. It produces a modest 40 Nm of torque to accelerate the bike up to 45 km/h (28 mph) from a standstill as safely and effortlessly as possible. A torque sensor ensures that power is delivered just as soon it detects a harder press on the pedal. The Gates Carbon belt drive linked to an internal five-gear hub propels the sturdy aluminum-framed bike forward on 27.5-inch wheels sporting high volume Cycl-e ST tires custom-designed by Pirelli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG01Gc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rj0dI5MzctdAE3bdXlQU6Kc_NaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445572/verge_DSC_3547_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big tires designed by Pirelli provide sure footing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NcVGeQR0S-GPavOc2Ma7nGDxQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445570/verge_DSC_3567_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battery is removable for easy charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U-PDfKzjLuU4DHfwku0rDQGO6Sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445581/verge_DSC_3470_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU requires moped license, registration, and liability insurance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cu_c6swP_gVYMdfHfuoO5zTbckg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445626/verge_DSC_3495_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power, light, and horn within easy access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5sqJx"&gt;My ST2 with the large-sized sport frame options came standard with fenders, a kickstand, and a mini rack; it did not come with the optional front and rear suspension. It weighs just shy of 33 kgs (72 pounds), which is undeniably heavy for an e-bike. But that mass makes the ride feel rock solid at top speed, without any worrisome wobble or flex when riding over bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbBJHz"&gt;Safety is also boosted by custom front and rear hydraulic disc brakes, an electric horn, daytime running lights, and a Roxim Z4E Pro headlight that can produce between 600 and 900 lumens at night. (A dazzling 1600-lumen option is available.) There’s also an integrated brake light around back. The required rearview mirror is useful to see overtaking motorists on roads, but it makes the bike quite wide. This resulted in a few slapped car mirrors before I got a feel for the added width. Fortunately, the mirror folds to make it a bit easier to walk the bike through narrow hallways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WeR8Bs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Stromer ST2 battery eject|101689" data-volume-uuid="5ed7aaa95" data-volume-id="101689" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-770" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyless battery makes a pleasant “thunk” when ejected after a touchscreen and button combo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qU48tm"&gt;My ST2 review bike came fitted with a 48V, 618Wh removable battery rated for up to 120 km or 75 miles, though I’d estimate real-world range for an aggressive rider like me is about half that. I managed just shy of 50 km (31 miles) with 10 percent charge remaining, according to the Stromer app, before deciding to top up. The ST2 has a customizable regenerative braking feature to make the most of the battery. That flat terrain I tested on didn’t benefit from the extended range allowed by the recuperation that’s possible on long steep declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFkSYB"&gt;I did about half of my testing while illegally riding on bicycle lanes because responsible individuals can regulate their speed for the slower flow of congested city riding. If a powerful Ferrari can share city roads with slower Hyundais, then certainly a powerful e-bike can share a dedicated lane with traditional bicyclists. Putting the ST2 into low-power mode makes this easy. My riding was an even mix of max power (setting 3) at max speed (up to 47 km/h, according to the integrated display) when commuting outside the city center, and lazy 20 to 30 km/h jaunts at low power (setting 1) around town. A beefier battery with a stated range of up to 180 km (110 miles) is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvevnP"&gt;The + and - buttons on the left grip make it easy to toggle between the three power modes, while the right grip is home to the shifter. The excellent 5-Speed Sturmey Archer shifter is smooth and reliable and conveniently works from a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="MEe4Lr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10447581"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7czTVY"&gt;The touchscreen display integrated into the top tube is the interface to a bike OS that’s overwrought, in my opinion, though some might like having access to every configuration option (and there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;) right on the bike. I do not, especially not when all that overhead makes the bike take 20 seconds just to boot, an eternity if you’re in a hurry. My bike was also configured to boot into a lock screen that was frustratingly slow to respond to the five taps required to enter my secret passcode. The display also easily washes out in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG2q9f"&gt;In my experience, it’s rare to make any changes once a bike is set up to your liking, meaning it’s best to offload more advanced features to an app. I prefer simple displays that boot fast and serve as a simple dashboard for basics like power setting and battery remaining. Stromer’s app is already very complete, offering lots of ride statistics and bike diagnostics in addition to options to tune the ride to your preferred balance of speed, torque, and agility. (I rode exclusively with the default “standard” setting.) The Stromer OMNI app is one of the best e-bike apps I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOg4kz"&gt;The ST2 is as high-tech as they come, fitted with Bluetooth to auto-lock / unlock the bike when in range, GPS tracking, and 3G data for over-the-air software updates. An anti-theft mode shuts off the motor and starts blaring the horn to scare off thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3QqgQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A true car replacement that beat a Tesla Model 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEOzQp"&gt;S-pedelecs can nearly reach the 50 km/h speed limit of most European cities, which is why they’re often pitched as true car replacements. Traditional e-bikes can already replace car commutes for many, but their top speed of 25 km/h means you’ll have to accept an extended travel time (while getting outside for some exercise). To test this theory, I “raced” a friend to a golf course to the north of Amsterdam; he in his new Tesla Model 3, me on the Stromer ST2 with a six-club pencil bag slung over my shoulder. His 30-minute trip took me just 27 minutes, and I had to wait 5 minutes for a ferry to arrive. Technically, I cheated by occasionally riding at top speed on &lt;em&gt;deserted&lt;/em&gt; bike lanes I wasn’t allowed to use... but should have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFk9lfBZsGdSyD4Owa9bLjwdrBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445520/verge_DSC_4224__1__2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speed pedelecs are forbidden on Dutch bike lanes like the one above and must share roads with cars instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g5Ndh8"&gt;Now, about EU directive 168/2013. As the name implies, it was conceived years before it was fully enacted on January 1st, 2017, which is part of the problem. It failed to anticipate the explosion of electric personal mobility devices we’ve seen over the last four years, especially in countries like the Netherlands where half of all new bicycles sold last year were electric. The directive splits e-bikes into two categories of “type approvals”: type L1e-A includes electric cargo bikes like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Carqon&lt;/a&gt;, while type L1e-B includes s-pedelecs like the Stromer ST2 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; gasoline-powered mopeds. Any e-bike maxing out at 25 km/h and 250 watts of continuous power is exempt from the directive and treated exactly like a regular bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g53jxW"&gt;Type L1e-B vehicles are limited to a maximum speed of 45 km/h and maximum continuous rated power of 4,000 watts. It requires mopeds and s-pedelecs to be fitted with a rearview mirror, horn, brake light, and prominent license plate; while the owner must be at least 16 years of age, wear a moped-rated helmet, possess a moped (type AM) driver’s license, be covered by liability insurance, and pay to have the vehicle registered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p6xOMf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why would any company bother?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7JqdNV"&gt;Critics like the European Light Electric Vehicle Advocacy group &lt;a href="https://www.bikenews.online/index.php?route=bossblog/article&amp;amp;filter_tag=E-Bike+Solutions&amp;amp;blog_article_id=270"&gt;LEVA-EU&lt;/a&gt; argue that because it was designed primarily for mopeds with combustion engines, the current type L1e-B approval process is unnecessarily complex and burdensome for bike makers. S-pedelec manufacturers are required to comply with &lt;a href="https://leva-eu.com/is-eu-type-approval-dangerous-for-speed-pedelec-riders/"&gt;1,036 pages&lt;/a&gt; of text, much of which is about moped safety and emission concerns that simply don’t apply to speed pedelecs. The result is higher costs passed onto consumers and curtailed adoption and innovation because... why would any company bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWWINp"&gt;Because Europe is Europe, there’s often variance in how regulations are set into law in each member country. While I complain about s-pedelec access to bike paths in Amsterdam, at least some bike lanes still allow them, unlike other European countries. Conversely, Belgium gives owners the choice to ride their s-pedelecs on any bike path or any road with a maximum speed limit of 50 km/h. It’s policy is informed by an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/10/4/87"&gt;effusive in-country study from 2019&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="POcgyP"&gt;The speed pedelec has the potential to be a sustainable alternative for cars with internal combustion engines for commuting purposes. For the Belgian case, commuting with a speed pedelec can solve problems regarding congestion and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PYjAEv"&gt;At the close of 2020, Stromer bikes registered in Belgium (4,061) were more than double that of my Dutch home (1,558), &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/market/nieuws/2021/02/stromer-solidifies-foothold-in-speed-pedelec-market-as-european-sales-grow-10139703"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bike Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And despite being the market leader for s-pedelecs throughout Europe, Stromer produced just 12,417 s-pedelecs in 2020, which is the same number of slow e-bikes Amsterdam-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;VanMoof makes in a month&lt;/a&gt;. European S-pedelec demand is clearly being stifled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xdqHK"&gt;So, what’s to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zkClKC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10447634"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAK9YH"&gt;The good news here is that the European Commission seems keen to address the regulations that currently govern e-bikes. In October, the EC asked TRL, a UK-based mobility researcher, to initiate a review of the EU’s type approval process required by EU directive 168/2013. TRL recently concluded its findings and &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/laws-regulations/nieuws/2021/03/do-not-introduce-e-bike-type-approval-trl-recommends-to-european-commission-10140091"&gt;recommended that s-pedelecs&lt;/a&gt; be moved out of the L1e-B moped category and into the far less restrictive L1e-A category. L1e-A type approvals currently cover 1,000-watt e-cargo bikes capped at 25 km/h and some vehicles with throttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyFycZ"&gt;It’s a positive sign but still “unfortunate” for s-pedelecs from the perspective of LEVA-EU. The advocacy group &lt;a href="https://leva-eu.com/leva-eu-position-on-review-for-zero-emission-tailpipe-vehicles/"&gt;has been pushing for an entirely new set of vehicle regulations&lt;/a&gt; for zero-emission vehicles like e-bikes, standing scooters, and electric skateboards based upon weight and speed only, not maximum continuous power. LEVA-EU believes that vehicles with similar levels of kinetic energy should be subjected to similar rules. It would therefore distinguish between vehicles with a maximum speed of 25 or 30 km/h and those capable of 45 or 50 km/h, instead of trying to bend the current regulations dictated by Directive 168/2013 (and the &lt;a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/laws-regulations/nieuws/2019/05/latest-eu-commissions-decision-changed-legal-status-of-e-bikes-10135911"&gt;related Machinery Directive&lt;/a&gt;) to the realities of modern transportation. While the TRL did recommend to “create a dedicated approval process for PMD [personal mobility devices] separate from Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and the Machinery Directive,” it capped this at a max speed of either 25 or 30 km/h, thus excluding s-pedelecs from the PMD category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9dGJ9"&gt;The EC isn’t bound by TRL’s recommendations so we’ll have to wait until 2022 for it to reveal its legislative proposal. Even then, any proposal would have to be negotiated with the member states; a process that could go on for years before new legislation is enacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHRqq3qbcoQEQJUfPRdEB1xReSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445618/verge_DSC_3452_ps_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stromer ST2 is also available in dark gray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xwUdbq"&gt;As much as I’d love to call for revolution and demand that urban commuters act on the moral obligation to disobey the unjust laws governing s-pedelecs in Europe, I can’t really apply the logic I used for a short-term review to long-term ownership — especially not with ST2 prices starting at $5,699 / €6,128. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xVpya"&gt;If you’re in the US, then no problem. But anyone in Europe interested in owning the ST2 or any speed pedelec that falls under the current L1e-B type designation had better do their homework. Not only do you need to factor in local laws that might differ from EU rules, but also the costs to register and insure yourself for such a nascent and confusing transportation category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVX7Nv"&gt;The Stromer ST2 is easily the most sophisticated and thrilling e-bike I’ve ridden since I began reviewing the category back in 2016. It also did the rarest of things by letting me glimpse a better future that’s just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KSEIhE"&gt;S-pedelecs could help accelerate European initiatives to &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en"&gt;green our cities&lt;/a&gt; and reclaim all of that space allocated to idling cars. But that won’t happen until EU regulators first remove the barriers to adoption and then create incentives to get city-dwellers out of their cars, even the electric ones, and onto bikes like the Stromer ST2. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds blindingly obvious Kindle feature to make book covers your lockscreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VSY_nxRq0k_yaOcxq3IUwAPAVP8=/0x26:1242x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135475/coversfliptheswitch_mobile.jpg._CB656387720_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to enables the Display Cover feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlKZPb"&gt;Amazon Kindle owners can now set the lockscreen image to the cover of the book they’re reading. The long overdue Display Cover feature, first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-display-cover-212808686.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was previously only available after &lt;a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information"&gt;jailbreaking&lt;/a&gt; your device (and a popular motivator to do so). Amazon says that it works with “most books, magazines, comics, and Manga.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCJe2k"&gt;The Display Cover feature is only supported on some Kindle devices without ads. These devices include the Kindle (8th, 10th generation), Kindle Paperwhite (7th, 10th gen), Kindle Oasis (8th, 9th, 10th gen), and Kindle Voyage (7th gen). If you can’t recall which Kindle you have then &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GK33S847NN4V6Y83"&gt;click here to identify it&lt;/a&gt;. Promotions on ad-supported devices can be disabled for $20, or by calling into customer support and asking &lt;em&gt;real nicely&lt;/em&gt;, according to many reports on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/mpu1ry/finally_removed_ads_from_my_kindle_love_it/"&gt;redditkindle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IqjaR"&gt;Supported Kindle devices running the latest firmware can activate the Display Cover feature by enabling the Show Cover option under Settings, Device Options. Just be sure whatever you’re reading is something you’re willing to advertise, m’kay weirdos?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM and LG Chem will reportedly announce Tennessee battery factory on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAByQlshoindLbrk4X5kLzQj5Wg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135443/GM_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new GM logo heralding its electric future.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFgCkZ"&gt;On Friday, General Motors and LG Chem are expected to announce a new $2.3 billion battery factory to be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee, say reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/LG-and-General-Motors-expected-to-set-up-EV-battery-plant-in-US"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-announce-second-us-battery-plant-tennessee-with-lg-chem-sources-2021-04-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/gm-expected-announce-tennessee-battery-plant-friday-77102235"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It would be the second US battery joint venture for the American and South Korean giants, after the pair first announced a $2.3 billion battery cell manufacturing plant in Lordstown, Ohio back in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZWkvx"&gt;The Spring Hill batteries will be used for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; electric SUV, say sources speaking to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. GM already announced that Lyriq will be powered by GM’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;scalable battery architecture called Ultium&lt;/a&gt;. Batteries based on Ultium would offer power ranging from 50 to 200 kWh that could allow for a driving range of 400 miles or more. The Cadillac Lyriq will be assembled at a Spring Hill plant starting next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oo6fwX"&gt;GM grew to be the largest automaker in North America on the back of combustion engines. Now it needs to ramp up production of electric vehicles in order to become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt;, and meet its goal to halt sales of light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2035. Having a ready supply of batteries is therefore a fundamental concern for GM’s future. The company had already vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025 and even redesigned its logo to look more like an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Silicon Valley’s Clipper all-in-one transit card finally adds Apple Pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bgr7rKNpctXB6qHCg5snumj5Akg=/0x0:1025x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134477/clipper_iphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPelC0"&gt;Silicon Valley might seem like a shining beacon of technological progress to some onlookers, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;natives know&lt;/a&gt; it can be weirdly hit and miss — like how the San Francisco Bay Area has long had a &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; tap-to-pay card that’ll let you onto practically every form of public transit, and yet never let you simply tap your phone or smartwatch to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daXw9q"&gt;Until today — because starting today, &lt;a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/whats-happening/news/clipperr-launches-iphone-and-apple-watch-debuts-new-mobile-app"&gt;the Clipper Card supports Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, including its Express Mode where you don’t need to wake the device or open an app first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiZ8h6"&gt;You can now use almost any recent iPhone or Apple Watch to board BART (which serves the East Bay and San Francisco), Muni (San Francisco’s bus and light rail system), Caltrain (which connects San Francisco to the peninsula and South Bay), VTA (South Bay buses and light rail), and even the ferry. (&lt;a href="https://transit.applepay.apple/san-francisco"&gt;Find instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NXfIs8r5YRG4wYjH2wUeevMqPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447652/bam_map_orig.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Map by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.alexanderli.net/design/sfbamm" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a pretty good picture of the SF Bay Area’s interlocking transit systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bCYsaN"&gt;That means travel across practically the entire urban and suburban Bay Area without pulling a wallet out of your purse or pocket — particularly since many of those vehicles also fit bikes on board. It’s not quite as significant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13401092/apple-pay-japan-suica-felica-nfc"&gt;as when Apple Pay came to Japan’s Suica in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, since that rail network spans an entire country, but it’s a big deal for tech workers and natives like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3gbN"&gt;Or it would be, if I ever work in an office again. Not much demand for that at the moment! But I used to take the Caltrain &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; either BART or Muni to work each day, and Clipper was my constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq5Ewa"&gt;There are a few caveats still: you can only load any given Clipper Card onto a single device, so you can’t share it across an iPhone and an Apple Watch simultaneously. (You can just use two cards, though, and it supports a variety of Clipper passes, not just cash.) You’ll also need an iPhone 8 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 3 or later, and Apple warns that you should “keep your plastic Clipper card for Bay Wheels bikeshare use and your RTC [disability discount] card for fare inspection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVaU5F"&gt;Android users with Clipper Cards should see similar capabilities via Google Pay later this spring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287043/google-maps-pay-parking-public-transportation-cities"&gt;and you should be able to buy a card directly through Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D10nF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store hosted kiddie games with secret gambling dens inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0LZ9nJLSZ4OeSuHlIF-Xa1aNEo=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134221/terrible_gambling_app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RhM0S"&gt;In popular culture, access to an illicit gambling den is as easy as stumbling into the right shop and saying the password — or greasing some palms. Apple’s App Store apparently has a real-life parallel: today, app developer Kosta Eleftheriou discovered a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; kiddie game that’s actually a front for gambling websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWKDA"&gt;The secret password isn’t one you’d be likely to guess: you have to be in the right country —or pretend to be in the right country using a VPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbSIV"&gt;But then, instead of launching an ugly monkey-flipping endless runner game filled with typos and bugs, the very same app launches a casino experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AjfMMO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a silly platformer game for children 4+, but if I set my VPN to Turkey and relaunch it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s IAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/crnOOF0pNi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/crnOOF0pNi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750329972805633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqH4eB"&gt;The app, “&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1546731180"&gt;Jungle Runner 2k21&lt;/a&gt;,” has already disappeared from the App Store, presumably thanks to publicity from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-ios-game-secretly-turns-into-a-gambling-app-1846693222?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/eleftheriou-turkish-casino-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who each wrote about Eleftheriou’s finding earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHIgJH"&gt;It’s not the only one, though: the same developer, “Colin Malachi,” had another incredibly basic game on the App Store called “Magical Forest - Puzzle” that was also a front for gambling. I tried them both myself, and here’s some visual evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsE6EBjU55YPHvUqGouoXePJij0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447520/gif_scam_apps.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVzpHf"&gt;Here’s what Magical Forest looked like when you opened it from the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JbJoJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10449066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1sdmf"&gt;I accessed them from a VPN server in Turkey; While &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball &lt;/em&gt;notes that users in other non-US countries like Italy also seem to have been able to access the gambling sites, I tried them with a number of other locations including Italy without success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmkf3F"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;the multi-million dollar App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; that Eleftheriou uncovered earlier this year, it’s not hard to see why Apple’s App Store review program might have missed these — they largely look like your typical shovelware if you don’t know the trick, with only a handful of tells... like the fact that Jungle Runner uses a Pastebin for its privacy policies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeQPxzwFu1dkZMM6kcelor3xFo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447552/pastebin_jungle_runner.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q46Ola"&gt;It’s not necessarily clear to me that they’d be violating very many of Apple’s App Store policies, either. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#gaming-gambling-and-lotteries"&gt;Gambling apps are permitted by Apple,&lt;/a&gt; as long as they’re geo-restricted to regions where that gambling is permitted by law, and you could maybe argue that’s exactly what this developer did by checking your IP address. But I imagine Cupertino would frown on a gambling app masquerading as a kid’s game either way — and Eleftheriou suggests the gambling sites may be scamming people out of money, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IlyJoT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an icing on the cake, people in the reviews say that they deposited large sums for the promise of a bonus, but they never received the promised payouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising no one, the scammers aren’t even operating a fair casino.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750376978313226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYkbVJ"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bplVAO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbKF23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Resident Evil 4 VR remake is launching on Oculus Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNdqZkV2eeEO14MSqxFAo7f2gXk=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134047/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JgcRx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; will be rereleased in virtual reality on the Oculus Quest 2 headset. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4’s &lt;/em&gt;VR remake will be a collaboration between series publisher Capcom, Oculus parent company Facebook, and the independent studio Armature. While Capcom didn’t offer much detail, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2NBKqjKcAeo?t=2930"&gt;some early footage&lt;/a&gt; shows a first-person adaptation of the classic third-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFBjzH"&gt;Capcom announced its news during a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; showcase that also included a new trailer for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386449/resident-evil-village"&gt;non-VR &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oculus and Facebook Reality Labs will reveal more about the game on April 21st, when Facebook is holding its own VR showcase for the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2xPb"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series has tried VR before. The 2017 first-person game &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; let you play through the entire game with a PlayStation VR headset, which made the game arguably scarier but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;more difficult to play&lt;/a&gt;. Capcom also released a &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0102-CUSA06799_00-BH70000KITCHEN01"&gt;VR-only demo&lt;/a&gt; for that game. But this is the first full &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game that seems specifically designed for VR — and specifically for Facebook’s standalone Oculus Quest 2. (While it’s not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 &lt;/em&gt;will also support the original Quest, Oculus has pushed to make Quest games compatible with both headsets in the past.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nzkix"&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; remake that fans have called for, and non-VR users may still want to focus on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309983/resident-evil-4-hd-project-remake-remaster-mod-pc-textures-graphics"&gt;fan-funded remaster&lt;/a&gt; of the original game. But it looks like the series’ first foray into making games specifically for VR — something that could provide a very different experience than adding headset support to a non-VR game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can play the second demo for Resident Evil Village on May 1st, or earlier on PlayStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNP-bpbztMheYeU1Yj60Fw0Q2vg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133843/re_village_jan21_screens_creature_01_1611268587718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yr8voq"&gt;During today’s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that a second demo for its upcoming survival horror game, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village,&lt;/em&gt; will release on May 1st. That’s six days before the game’s official release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8iFxg"&gt;Unlike the previous “Maiden” demo, this demo will be playable on all platforms the game will releases on, including PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Windows PC (via Steam), and Stadia. The demo will allow you to play for 60 minutes and explore both the village and castle areas, regardless of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI1rIi"&gt;PS4 and PS5 users will have the option to preload the demo beginning today via the PlayStation Store. Additionally, players on these two platforms will receive early access to the demo on two separate weekends — April 17th at 5PM ET through April 18th at 4AM ET, and April 24th at 5PM ET through April 25th at 4AM ET. Each demo weekend will provide up to 30 minutes of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMDOXs"&gt;Capcom also released the fourth trailer for the game, which includes new footage and another look at Lady Dimitrescu. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 7th on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, and Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fyre Festival settlement reveals the true cost of schadenfreude — $7,220 a pop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmHOcSWZM7hNt9XE516mUIIycdg=/0x11:1184x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133701/fyre_festival_poster.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fyre Festival LLC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTKLcI"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Festival — think: The Hunger Games, but for influencers — have agreed to a settlement with 277 attendees for $7,220 apiece, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/arts/music/fyre-festival-settlement.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYK4el"&gt;Tickets for the 2017 “luxury” music festival on a remote island in the Bahamas that actually turned out to be a beach full of FEMA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WNFIV/status/857744138019753984"&gt;tents&lt;/a&gt; and some pathetic cheese sandwiches, cost anywhere from $1,000 to as much as $12,000 — more if you bought a package deal. Yes, really, because Fyre Festival organizers, while apparently not adept enough to coordinate hotel bookings and a caterer, did enlist big-name Instagram stars to sing the praises of the inaugural event, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;Kendall Jenner, who received $250,000&lt;/a&gt; for a post she’s since deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc6bFT"&gt;Organizers also (falsely) claimed that the island was once owned by notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Weird flex, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WYadx2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mz5kY3RsmKo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rv0szz"&gt;Jenner did not attend the event, but she too, eventually paid for it, in the form of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kendall-jenner-pay-90-000-settlement-promoting-fyre-festival-n1212011"&gt;$90,000 settlement&lt;/a&gt; last year. Organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. He was also &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fyre-festival-attendees-win-5-million-lawsuit-695806/"&gt;ordered to pay $5 million&lt;/a&gt; to two people who paid $13,000 each for VIP packages (did the sandwiches come with extra cheese slices?). McFarland’s business partner, rapper Ja Rule, was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtYThj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;hunger games, but for influencers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3oXrn"&gt;The festival that became a go-to example of schadenfreude and (yet another) cautionary tale about believing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15471112/fyre-fest-instagram-hailey-baldwin-bella-hadid-sponsored-posts"&gt;sponcon on social media&lt;/a&gt; was eventually the source of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;two documentaries, for Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. And because time is a flat circle, the tweet of the “dinner” from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;Fyre Fest is being offered for auction as an NFT,&lt;/a&gt; but at least the money there should go to a good cause: original tweeter Trevor DeHaas is having a kidney transplant and says he needs to raise $80,000 for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OM6Yrd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The dinner that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fyrefestival?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fyrefestival?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I8d0UlSNbd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Trevor DeHaas (@trev4president) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjH74g"&gt;The $2 million class-action settlement, reached in US Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, is currently awaiting final approval, with a hearing scheduled for May 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXfBmt"&gt;The final amount attendees receive could eventually be reduced, depending what happens with other creditors in Fyre Festival’s bankruptcy case. But at least the ticket holders have already had some practice in getting less than they were promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cBmAv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIOi29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please keep Anish Kapoor away from the whitest white paint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man with sunglasses on holding up a panel with a very bright white square painted on it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdbKYAQ4QhRaFyQ_CgWHDZHAih0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133636/ruan_xiulin_portraitLO.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiulin Ruan, one of the researchers who made the whitest white paint, holding up a sample. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jared Pike / Purdue University&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbkCOr"&gt;Researchers at Purdue University say they have created the whitest paint on record. In fact, they’ve now crafted an ultra-white paint twice: in October, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q4/this-white-paint-could-reduce-the-need-for-air-conditioning-by-keeping-surfaces-cooler-than-surroundings.html"&gt;they announced&lt;/a&gt; a white paint that was capable of reflecting 95.5 percent of sunlight. But they decided to outdo themselves with a new formulation, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/the-whitest-paint-is-here-and-its-the-coolest.-literally..html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, that reflects up to 98.1 percent of sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX2ttC"&gt;The thing about a very white paint is that, along with reflecting light, it also rejects heat. As any goth who has spent the day on the beach knows, black absorbs light and will heat up. The hope with an ultra-white paint is that it could be used on buildings to keep them cooler without air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Lfs"&gt;The science of the paint comes down to a high concentration of barium sulfate, a compound that’s already used in paints and photographic paper. The barium sulfate particles are different sizes, allowing the paint to scatter a broader range of light than if they were all the same size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjZTGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have concerns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OndOh"&gt;This all sounds very cool, but I have concerns. And that’s because one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2017/07/anish-kapoor-blackest-black/"&gt;well-known dramas&lt;/a&gt; in the art world has to do with the blackest black: Vantablack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gSSI"&gt;Vantablack is a material made with nanotubes that is able to absorb up to 99.99 percent of visible light. The most accessible form of it, a sprayable paint called Vantablack S-VIS, is exclusively licensed to the studio of Anish Kapoor so that he can monopolize the ability to make such groundbreaking artworks as... &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/man-injured-falling-into-anish-kapoor-hole-1335176"&gt;a big black hole in the floor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVF7YZ"&gt;Kapoor’s hogging of Vantablack incensed other artists so much that another artist, Stuart Semple, created “the world’s pinkest pink” pigment. (It’s unclear if it actually is the pinkest pink, but I guess scientists are still busy with black and white.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLHirM"&gt;The pink is available for anyone to buy, except for Anish Kapoor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Cw6Jlg"&gt;By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fLcu5n"&gt;The beef did not stop there, however, because Kapoor got his hands on the pinkest pink and posted to Instagram an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOWz73wgj7R/"&gt;extremely classy photo&lt;/a&gt; of his middle finger coated in it, with the caption, “Up yours.” Great guy, love the attitude. Semple then went on to create &lt;a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/art/anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-vantablack-blackest-black"&gt;his own ultra-black pigments and paints&lt;/a&gt;, which are available to everyone except, you guessed it, Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLB6o"&gt;So please, researchers who are bringing us ultra-white paint, do not let Anish Kapoor get anywhere near it. Ideally, anything that could be used to improve people’s lives while reducing the energy they use should be free and widely available. And my fragile psyche just can’t handle more paint-based art battles. &lt;/p&gt;
