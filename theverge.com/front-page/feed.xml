    <title>Amazon Prime Day kicks off on June 21st</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lnJmt"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the company’s annual shopping holiday, will take place on Monday, June 21st through June 22nd, the company officially announced today. The forthcoming summer dates mark a return to form; the retail giant has historically held its shopping extravaganza in mid-July but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332350/amazon-prime-day-delayed-us-india-august-coronavirus"&gt;postponed last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;most recent earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon previously confirmed this year’s Prime Day would take place in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaNVR"&gt;Like previous years, you can expect to find discounts on true wireless earbuds, 4K TVs of all sizes and panel types, video games, and more. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has become one of the best opportunities to get deals, whether they’re for gifts or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZbz5j"&gt;Amazon says that this year’s Prime Day “will feature millions of deals from top brands and more than a million deals from small and medium businesses.” The company says it’s investing more than $100 million to help small businesses during Prime Day, and Prime members will get a $10 credit to use during Prime Day if they spend $10 at “select small businesses” on Amazon from June 7th through June 20th. Throughout the event, the company will also spotlight deals on Amazon Live, a streaming platform on which brands and creators highlight various products sold on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFUMSs"&gt;Traditionally, the marquee event — which sees exclusive discounts on Amazon devices, clothing, electronics, and a host of other consumer goods — has been a huge revenue boon for Amazon, which, despite the ongoing pandemic, managed to bring in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22404044/amazon-earnings-q1-2021-performance-profit-operating-income"&gt;$108.5 billion in net sales in Q1&lt;/a&gt;. Third-party sellers alone &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-prime-day-2020-marked-two-biggest-days-ever-small-medium"&gt;earned more than $3.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the two-day event last year, however, the e-commerce giant has not disclosed total sales figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB8BJR"&gt;Since its inception in 2015, Amazon has leveraged the global shopping event as a way to retain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, which now top &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;more than 200 million&lt;/a&gt;, and bolster sales during what is often considered a slow period for retailers. Last year’s Prime Day essentially kicked off the holiday shopping season early, though Amazon likely wants to avoid running up against Black Friday and Cyber Monday, two of the biggest shopping days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anx475"&gt;This year’s Prime Day also takes place during a time of momentous change at Amazon. Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455126/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-july-5-birthday"&gt;set to become Amazon’s CEO&lt;/a&gt; on July 5th, and the company recently announced its plan to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;, an acquisition that will further bolster the company’s entertainment properties and likely help grow its Amazon Prime Video library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acucMo"&gt;As Amazon continues to grow, however, so do the labor disputes. Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;historic loss&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is challenging the results of its recent union drive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423366/amazon-union-election-appeal-hearing"&gt;in an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, employees continue to put pressure on Jassy and current CEO Jeff Bezos in regards to a multitude of issues, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy7ewR"&gt;Last year, Amazon workers in Germany even went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amazon-workers-in-germany-strike-on-prime-day.html"&gt;stage a Prime Day strike&lt;/a&gt; to protest for better working conditions and higher wages, a tactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;seen in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is turning a factory into a gallery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYDUWfWE4ELXhhfn8Rk1TmOpigY=/109x0:1311x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375180/photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GgZjm"&gt;Nintendo has announced that its Uji Ogura plant will be turned into a public gallery to “showcase the many products Nintendo has launched over its history.” The factory, located in the Ogura district of Uji, a city just outside Kyoto, was built in 1969 and was mainly used for manufacturing playing cards and hanafuda cards, which is how Nintendo got started as a business in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHDggt"&gt;“Nintendo has been discussing the possibility of building a gallery, as a way to share Nintendo’s product development history and philosophy with the public,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “To this end, the Nintendo Uji Ogura Plant will be renovated to accommodate the gallery, a decision reached after taking consideration of The City of Uji’s plan of re-developing the nearby Ogura Station area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHVeoF"&gt;Nintendo expects the gallery to be completed in its fiscal year from April 1st, 2023 to March 31st, 2024. Right now the working title is “Nintendo Gallery.” The facility will no doubt be popular with tourists visiting Kyoto, many of whom make the pilgrimage to Nintendo’s headquarters even though it’s a nondescript office block that’s closed to the public. And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;the new Super Nintendo World area&lt;/a&gt; at Universal Studios Japan is located fairly close in neighboring Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government’s been worried about DJI drones — the Pentagon now says they’re safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has now admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), releasing a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim isn’t being addressed at all today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZK8gA"&gt;But, according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;, the Pentagon said that it didn’t find any malicious code when it analyzed two drone models. The Department of Homeland Security previously &lt;a href="https://www.auvsi.org/sites/default/files/DHS%20report.pdf"&gt;ran tests on the DJI Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 Pro in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and didn’t find evidence of data being sent places it shouldn’t, and a new administration has seemingly come to a similar conclusion today. Another report &lt;a href="https://www.precisionhawk.com/blog/unmanned-aerial-intelligence-technology-center-of-excellence-conducts-risk-assessment-of-drone-technology"&gt;that looked at three DJI drones&lt;/a&gt;, including the Government Editions of the aforementioned drones, came to the same conclusion in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApNCS"&gt;The Pentagon’s report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the US government. As of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/01/2021-11304/addition-of-entities-revision-of-entries-and-removal-of-entity-from-the-entity-list-and-revision-of"&gt;today’s revision&lt;/a&gt;, DJI is still on the Entity List, which prevents US companies from selling any of their technology for DJI to use, and the Pentagon’s report comes as Congress is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;considering a law&lt;/a&gt; that would ban the government from buying Chinese drones for five whole years, starting in 2023. They’d have to rely on other approved drones from companies in the US and France instead; as restrictions have been placed on DJI, others have made drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;with hefty price tags&lt;/a&gt; to fill the government’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EmAFe"&gt;We’re also talking about pretty old DJI drones that have gotten the all-clear; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13508560/dji-mavic-pro-drone-review-price"&gt;we reviewed the consumer model of DJI’s Mavic Pro in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s offered many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review"&gt;far more competitive models&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSFRAr"&gt;None of the government scrutiny keeps you from buying a DJI drone. Despite all the accusations, DJI has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;still been able&lt;/a&gt; to continue creating and selling its consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEQVE7"&gt;Lawmakers are still trying to decide what to do about other Chinese products perceived to be a security risk as well: while the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454292/xiaomi-blacklist-removed-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;has rolled back the designation&lt;/a&gt; of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company”, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;seems like it still intends&lt;/a&gt; to keep a ban on Huawei products from being used in US infrastructure. The government has been so worried about equipment from Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei acting as part of its network infrastructure that it’s even considered removing the parts already in use. Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;the FCC estimated it would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” Chinese telecom equipment currently embedded in US networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOd3mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, its external GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0At8coQWAnATTi-CGE73BJpueFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374949/alienware-dell-11_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZG4To8"&gt;We recently noticed that Alienware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22440352/alienware-x15-x17-gaming-laptop-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-price-release-date-features-specs"&gt;just-announced X15 and X17 thin and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;vaguely light  gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are conspicuously missing a port — and it’s not because they’re thin-and-light, it turns out. Alienware has just confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier external GPU, and so these laptops won’t need that proprietary port anymore. The company isn’t saying whether it’ll offer a future eGPU, but pointed us to off-the-shelf Thunderbolt ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSyxA"&gt;The Alienware Graphics Amp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7079879/alienware-new-graphics-amplifier-laptop"&gt;was first introduced in 2014 for $299&lt;/a&gt; and designed to be a companion to the company’s midrange Alienware 13, giving it the vast majority of the power of a desktop graphics card plus four extra full-size USB ports when docked. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alienware-13-review-the-first-futureproof-gaming-lapto-1651514489"&gt;I liked the combo well enough&lt;/a&gt;. But over the years, Alienware added the port to practically every laptop (and some of its more compact desktops, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/27/9214017/alienware-x51-13-15-17-18-refresh"&gt;like the Alienware X51&lt;/a&gt; mini-tower and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924092/alienware-oled-laptop-alpha-r2-aurora-announced-pricing-release-date-e3-2016"&gt;Alienware Alpha R2&lt;/a&gt; console-sized PC) it released, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294631/alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price-features"&gt;the company’s flagship Area-51M&lt;/a&gt; which was designed to have built-in upgrades of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v3dMs8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cQfy-j1Ssw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zul4Ph"&gt;With an included 460W power supply devoted entirely to the GPU, and a price that dipped to $199 and occasionally $150, the Amp managed to stay competitive for quite a while &lt;a href="https://egpu.io/best-egpu-buyers-guide/"&gt;in the fairly niche market of eGPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which generally use manufacturer-agnostic Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of proprietary cables (and can often charge your laptop as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x3Owz"&gt;It’s not clear when Alienware discontinued the Amp. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201108140000/https://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/alienware-graphics-amplifier"&gt;The Wayback Machine shows&lt;/a&gt; it was still live as of November 2020, and Dell last updated &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178406/alienware-graphics-amplifier-supported-graphics-card-list" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its support page&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021 — without adding compatibility for the latest wave of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnkLc9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22367807/alienware-m15-r5-15-inch-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-edition-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;new Alienware M15 R5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429412/intel-11th-gen-h-series-laptops"&gt;M15 R6&lt;/a&gt; also omit the Graphics Amplifier port. It’ll be interesting to see if this is the end for Alienware’s dreams of upgradable laptops; certainly the Amp lasted a lot longer than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;the idea of offering new chips for the giant Area-51m laptop.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s Sonos-powered picture frame speaker is on its website right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vb4PAjM7WkQFvsOn6v2sb5yJYTQ=/0x681:1833x1903/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374913/527874AA_8623_4DAC_8326_F4755AEB19C4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9AfEGC"&gt;Confirming what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported back in April,&lt;/a&gt; Ikea tonight listed a new Symonisk “picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker” product on its website. The device, which is listed for $199, has not yet been announced — but it’s one of two new collaborations between Ikea and Sonos set for release in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPKkcf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F1%2F22464111%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the likely-to-be-removed website&lt;/a&gt;, the Symfonisk picture frame measures 22 inches high, 16 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Ikea says customers will be able to choose between “various interchangeable fronts,” and the frame will be offered in either black or white finishes. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;the previous two Symfonisk products&lt;/a&gt;, the picture frame is designed to blend into your home decor and not stick out as an obvious tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAwwDVf4sjPMFnyaXhgL_wvAZiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553758/CBC65B12_8E41_4A54_9B83_C8D83CC6089B.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBoNDk"&gt;“You can choose to hang it on its own on the wall as an eye-catcher, match it with your other pictures on a wall, place it on the floor, or lean it against a wall,” Ikea’s site says of the picture frame. Despite the name “picture frame,” it seems that you won’t be able to put your own photos into this frame; it’s more of an art piece. The front material is likely specially designed to help sound pass through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeFtnE"&gt;Ikea’s site confirms the Symfonisk picture frame will support Apple’s AirPlay 2, allow for stereo pairing — including as rear surrounds for a Sonos Arc or Beam soundbar — and can be controlled through the Sonos app just like previous Symfonisk products. It also has this quote from Sonos product manager Sara Morris: “By working together with the designers we were able to keep the thin edge of the picture frame while hiding a deeper acoustic volume behind it. Together with a waveguide, this let us make big room filling sound from what looks like a thin speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmFWuc"&gt;The other 2021 Symfonisk joint effort between Ikea and Sonos will be a redesigned table lamp speaker. June 14th is the latest rumored date for when the two companies will officially announce both products — even if Ikea got a little ahead of itself this evening. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As Disney Plus celebrates Pride, its parent is hit with sexual orientation discrimination suit </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney+" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGB-z9vFVpx2550IiQCvFzGHnps=/0x0:3562x2375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374854/1211180771.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo of the online video library Disney+ is shown on the display of a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="enTWCG"&gt;Even as Disney’s marquee streaming service celebrates Pride Month with a prominently positioned carousel of LGBTQ+ titles on its homepage, the company has found itself at the center of a sexual orientation discrimination lawsuit brought by an executive employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nqqPm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DISNEY-SEXUAL-DISCRIMINATION-SUIT.pdf"&gt;The complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, as reported earlier &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/disney-pride-sexual-orientation-discrimination-lawsuit-joel-hopkins-1234767315/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was filed today in a California superior court on behalf of television executive Joel Hopkins, lawyers confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Hopkins had been with the company since 1994. The suit alleges that around the time that he was promoted to vice president of production finance for Touchstone Television in 2000, it became known that Hopkins identified as gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1GTLA"&gt;At this time, despite his tenure and previous promotions within the company, Hopkins “experienced an ongoing pattern of discrimination, including, but not limited to, being passed over for promotions and not being paid at a level commensurate with other department heads,” the complaint states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXeiUr"&gt;In addition to allegedly being subject to what is characterized in the suit as unwarranted scrutiny and harassment, he was also allegedly blamed for problems that were not his responsibility as well as repeatedly overlooked for better opportunities for growth within the company. In some cases, these oversights were egregious to the extent that others with less or no relevant experience were promoted to these roles. He was also allegedly left out of executive meetings and alleges his role in the management of other employees was diminished as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTg69p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hopkins “experienced an ongoing pattern of discrimination, including, but not limited to, being passed over for promotions.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vj8C6a"&gt;According to the suit, Hopkins “made direct and repeated complaints to HR” about the discrimination he had experienced, but the HR department and his employers “provided no relief whatsoever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFHIjz"&gt;“After his sexual orientation become known to his superiors and after being discriminated against, and after being put on a dead-end career track and repeatedly denied promotions with no remedy or relief from HR, Plaintiff is informed and believes that yet again, in or around April 2021, several promotions occurred, but Plaintiff once again was not promoted,” the complaint states. “Plaintiff is informed and believes that these promotions occurred despite representations that Disney was hurting financially and was not promoting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnSxR0"&gt;The complaint was brought under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which bars workplace discrimination on the basis of, among other things, sexual orientation. The suit seeks compensatory damages for lost benefits and wages as well as medical expenses and emotional distress, in addition to trial and lawyers’ fees. It also seeks “punitive damages in an amount appropriate to punish Defendants and to deter others from engaging in similar conduct for all causes of action in which such damages are recoverable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GhI1l"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither Riverside Television Services nor ABC Signature Studios, which are also named as plaintiffs in the suit, immediately returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEFBtY"&gt;While The Walt Disney Company is being sued over allegations of sexual orientation discrimination at the corporate level, its tentpole streaming service has made Pride Month a key focus of content curation on its homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTiv0K"&gt;Disney Plus is the company’s crown jewel, and arguably its most consumer-facing product at present. The company’s business has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-wants-to-be-netflix-now-1845352173"&gt;essentially been reshuffled&lt;/a&gt; to focus almost exclusively on making Disney Plus a success. As Pride kicks off this month, a prominent “Celebrate Pride Month” column on the service features titles such as &lt;em&gt;Out,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Howard,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Runaways&lt;/em&gt;, and more than half a dozen other Pride-friendly titles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is once again taking your requests for a blue verification badge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kVA7UblHcVeS9-C3MqeVzJ_MmHo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374850/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgM9Z4"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1399876931135356936"&gt;reopened verification&lt;/a&gt; applications after pausing them last week, Twitter announced on Tuesday. The pause, which went in place on Friday, came just eight days after the formal relaunch of verification applications on May 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4pBwJ"&gt;When Twitter first reopened verification applications in May, it said that responses to applications would come back “within a few days,” but warned that they might take up to “a few weeks” depending on the volume of applications the company received. It’s not clear if you should expect similar timelines for a response following the pause and reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c0BcYi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Requests are open! Sorry about that pause –– now you can get back to your quest for a blue badge.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1399876931135356936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voD7OP"&gt;Twitter didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKFu4G"&gt;With Twitter’s new verification program, anyone is able to apply to get a blue check mark that denotes someone as a verified user. However, only six categories of accounts actually qualify for verification, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;according to Twitter’s revamped criteria&lt;/a&gt;: government; companies, brands, and organizations; news organizations and journalists; entertainment; sports and gaming; and activists, organizers, and other influential individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook employees call for company to address concerns of Palestinian censorship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dk6HOhkiTTQ-3pOxo1EIuWZW6uY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374670/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5TaWJr"&gt;Facebook employees are circulating an internal petition calling for the company to investigate content moderation systems that led many Palestinians and allies to say their voices were being censored, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19da5f33-1c83-42ae-993e-27529e89e8f7"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes weeks after Israeli airstrikes killed more than 200 people in Gaza, including at least 63 children. Israel and Hamas have now reached a cease fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRgwOB"&gt;Palestinian activists and allies have long accused social media companies of censoring pro-Palestinian content — and the issue has only gotten worse during the recent conflict. At Facebook, content moderation decisions are made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;third-party contractors&lt;/a&gt; and algorithms, and the process is less than perfect, particularly in non-English speaking countries. After Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/instagram-facebook-censored-al-aqsa-mosque"&gt;restricted a hashtag referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, pro-Palestinian activists &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;coordinated a campaign to leave one-star reviews of Facebook in the app store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcoTxx"&gt;It appears Facebook employees are taking note. “As highlighted by employees, the press, and members of Congress, and as reflected in our declining app store rating, our users and community at large feel that we are falling short on our promise to protect open expression around the situation in Palestine,” they wrote in the petition. “We believe Facebook can and should do more to understand our users and work on rebuilding their trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y68Lb2"&gt;The letter was posted on an internal forum by employees in groups called “Palestinians@” and “Muslims@.” It reportedly has 174 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVijy1"&gt;Employees are asking Facebook to do a third-party audit of content moderations decisions surrounding Arab and Muslim content. They also want a post by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he allegedly called Palestinian civilians terrorists, to be reviewed by the company’s independent oversight board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlnCQA"&gt;Last month, employees at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; wrote internal letters calling for executives to support Palestine. Employees at all three tech giants said they felt executives were unsupportive of Muslim workers. Some also wanted Google and Amazon to review a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-picks-amazons-aws-google-flagship-cloud-project-2021-04-21/"&gt;$1.2-billion cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; the companies had recently signed with the Israeli government. Yet no company had as immediate an impact on information surrounding the fighting as Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgFn3m"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Facebook spokesperson said the company has committed to an audit of its community standards enforcement report. “We know there were several issues that impacted people’s ability to share on our apps,” the spokesperson added. “While we fixed them, they should never have happened in the first place and we’re sorry to anyone who felt they couldn’t bring attention to important events, or who believed this was a deliberate suppression of their voice. We design our policies to give everyone a voice while keeping them safe on our apps and we apply them equally, regardless of who is posting or what their personal beliefs are.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, the SEC has noticed Elon Musk’s Tesla stock price tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXtzlFIP0mRJcJ5NfTzIQU--TEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374615/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NN4hiI"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission believes Elon Musk has violated his 2018 settlement agreement twice, according to correspondence obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-failed-to-oversee-elon-musk-s-tweets-sec-argued-in-letters-11622582765?mod=hp_lead_pos2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the SEC and Tesla. The agreement requires a lawyer to approve his tweets about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM6Vq"&gt;Tesla lawyers didn’t review Musk’s May 2020 tweet about how Tesla’s stock price was “too high imo” before he published it. The company’s lawyers also didn’t approve a July 2019 tweet about Musk’s goal to make 1,000 of Tesla’s solar roofs per week by the end of that year. The SEC sent the letters to Tesla in 2019 and 2020 shortly after each tweet, but has not taken any apparent enforcement action against Musk or the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCI6yj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="leabS3"&gt;Musk originally found himself in hot water with the SEC in August 2018 after he infamously tweeted he had “[f]unding secured” to take Tesla private at a price of $420 per share. (He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt;, and had only held preliminary talks with Saudi Arabia to fund such a move.) The agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;charged him with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; in September, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-law"&gt;two sides quickly settled&lt;/a&gt;. Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla, and also agreed to have his public communications (aka his tweets) vetted by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOGAGb"&gt;In early 2019, though, the SEC asked a judge to hold Musk in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18240568/elon-musk-tesla-sec-contempt-of-court-settlement-violation-tweet-twitter"&gt;contempt of court for violating the original settlement&lt;/a&gt;. Musk tweeted an estimate for how many cars Tesla would make that year that was higher than the company’s official guidance. The SEC discovered that Tesla’s lawyers had not approved the tweet, and took Musk and his company back to court. The two sides ultimately agreed to more specific vetting of Musk’s tweets about Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;especially around production, sales, or delivery numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b76YGP"&gt;The SEC wrote Tesla in August 2019 about the solar roof tweet, arguing it was a clear violation of the amended settlement terms. But Tesla said in response that Musk’s estimate was “wholly aspirational.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM8dRM"&gt;“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order,” Steven Buchholz, one of the SEC’s enforcement officials, wrote to Tesla in May 2020 in the letters the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; obtained. It was in response to the stock price tweet. Tesla responded that the tweet was simply Musk’s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxnHm6"&gt;Musk went on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; in late 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/9/18133591/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-60-minutes-interview-twitter"&gt;to say that no one has been approving his tweets &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; the settlement&lt;/a&gt;. His public attitude toward the agency hasn’t changed much from the open scorn Musk expressed on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. Last July, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1278764736876773383?s=20"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oil and gas leases suspended in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A polar bear seen with cubs at Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 2014, in North Slope, Alaska." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91a3EHoF1XPRyLaLUOboiCAe7kI=/0x1:5150x3434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374358/465903520.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZU9AIq"&gt;The Biden administration moved forward today with its plans to pause — and potentially halt — oil and gas drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Department of the Interior (DOI) announced today that it suspended leases that the previous administration auctioned off to oil and gas developers just weeks before Donald&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump left office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Sxhz"&gt;Today’s decision follows through on an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; President Joe&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Biden made on the same day of his inauguration, which asked the Secretary of the Interior to put a temporary moratorium on all oil and gas activities in the refuge. Oil and gas leases will be suspended while the Interior Department conducts a new environmental review, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-suspends-oil-and-gas-leases-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued today. Based on that review, the leases could be voided or subject to additional restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3LYwLk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Legal deficiencies” with the previous environmental review &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7cYBmS"&gt;The DOI said that it needs to address “legal deficiencies” with the previous environmental review conducted by the Trump administration. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is home to a dwindling population of polar bears and is where migrating caribou return each year to have their calves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iztK4l"&gt;The Trump administration carried out a hurried lease sale on January 6, giving companies permission to develop more than 430,000 acres of land in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Facing heat from indigenous and environmental advocates, major oil and gas companies decided not to bid on leases. So the land sold for dirt cheap — as little as $25 per acre for a total of $14 million. The state-owned Alaska Investment Development and Export Authority got seven of the nine tracts that were auctioned off. The Department of Justice then rushed its antitrust review of the leases, according to FOIA documents obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/01/biden-anwr-alaska-oil-491498"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They completed the review in a single day instead of the weeks or months it normally takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDP89j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Putting us on the right path forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xgeKDB"&gt;“I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognizing the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,” Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/biden-drilling.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/climate/biden-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/biden-drilling.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt; York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCaAJf"&gt;But Biden faces pressure from groups hounding him to do more to protect other areas of Alaska from oil and gas infrastructure. Last week, the Biden administration filed a &lt;a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/conocophillips_willow_doj_brief.pdf"&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; supporting ConocoPhillips plans to pump more oil out of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, just west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also proposed a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-11496.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&amp;amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov"&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; that would allow oil and gas companies to harass polar bears and walruses in the Beaufort Sea and Western Arctic as long as they’re not killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJGZ2N"&gt;Outside of Alaska, activists are calling Biden out for not intervening in two major pipeline battles. Last month, a federal court allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/21/politics/dakota-access-pipeline-continue-operation/index.html"&gt;keep operating&lt;/a&gt; while it undergoes an environmental review. And while Biden halted the construction of the Keystone XL, he hasn’t moved to stop the construction of Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356423/oil-gas-pipelines-abandoned-enbridge-line-3"&gt;first major pipeline abandonment and replacement project in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Opponents say thousands of activists are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nd-state-wire-environment-and-nature-business-5afd0c068906c4b9281e30a00a4e6268"&gt;gearing up for demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; against Line 3 this week. &lt;/p&gt;
