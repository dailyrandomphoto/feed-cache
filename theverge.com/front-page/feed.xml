    <title>Fortnite’s Galactus event was a giant arcade shooter — and now the game is down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/831lvmmxJYvB4txeF-bL6qec2NE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68142981/Fortnite_20201201161237.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Kt3S9"&gt;The Marvel-themed season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; ended with a Galactus-sized bang. As has been teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;since the debut of season 4 in August&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s current season concluded with a live event that pitted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players against the planet-sized supervillain in a dramatic showdown — and it ended with the game going down, replaced by a timer for the launch of season 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPCDea"&gt;For those who managed to get into the event, things started out pretty tame. I spent around half an hour just hanging around on the Avengers’ helicarrier while empty-handed, not able to do anything like build or pick up a weapon. Epic even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1333873453376663558"&gt;posted a message&lt;/a&gt; letting players know they were indeed in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0n6tei"&gt;When the event started properly, Galactus slowly made his way to the island before bellowing the ominous words “Beware. I hunger.” He then slapped the helicarrier out of the sky, and players were guided into the action by Iron Man himself. It was a strange event: in order to stop Galactus from destroying the island, players had to pilot a version of the iconic battle bus armed with explosives to feed the supervillain. Things played out like an over-the-top arcade shooter and eventually ended with Galactus exploding, leaving the island seemingly intact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p30ql5U63p3FBlPBfC0t42TCfwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22134838/Fortnite_20201201161905.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eD3xwDXVf_Mhq31q2irSvL4Fz78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22135591/Fortnite_20201201161719.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HOeAxxpCxedK7R06gkXI9tJ0SI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22134842/Fortnite_20201201161314.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJQoRo"&gt;There was also a tease connecting the events to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s own strange lore: things ended with a shot of main character Jonesy, in a suit, lying on the floor of a drab office. Currently, the game is down, with a countdown ticking away the hours until season 5 launches at 12AM ET tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiHdQQ"&gt;Leading up to the event, Galactus’ face could be seen looking in the background during battle royale matches, steadily growing in size with each day that passed. It also appears that developer Epic expected a big crowd, warning players to arrive an hour ahead of the 4PM ET kickoff time (though it ended up starting a bit later than that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmtWyG"&gt;Of course, this is just the latest in a series of dramatic live events in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In the past, that has included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;a mech versus kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;an explosion that flooded the island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;a Travis Scott concert series&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the most ambitious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;saw the entire island sucked into a black hole&lt;/a&gt;, shutting the game down for several days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;before the launch of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;: Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Salesforce is acquiring workplace chat app Slack for $27.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDZyQ59uEKpgSLQY81f8RgS9QKM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68137830/akrales_190410_3363_0096.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oDaS74"&gt;Cloud computing giant Salesforce is acquiring workplace chat app Slack, the two companies &lt;a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-has-held-talks-to-buy-slack-technologies-11606326392"&gt;rumblings of which began surfacing last week&lt;/a&gt;, marks one of the most consequential acquisitions in the business software industries in recent years and Salesforce’s biggest purchase ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="190ebj"&gt;Salesforce is paying $27.7 billion for Slack, according to the press release. “Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce’s common stock on November 30, 2020,” the announcement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWNzEX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms in enterprise software history.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnI40g"&gt;“Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms in enterprise software history, with an incredible ecosystem around it,” said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. “This is a match made in heaven. Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world. I’m thrilled to welcome Slack to the Salesforce Ohana once the transaction closes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqjwca"&gt;“Salesforce started the cloud revolution, and two decades later, we are still tapping into all the possibilities it offers to transform the way we work. The opportunity we see together is massive,” said Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. “As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can’t wait to get going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqk9BU"&gt;Slack has transformed from a fast-rising startup formed as a gaming company in 2009 into a major competitor of Microsoft with more than 12 million daily active users as of October of last year (and likely many more now, though the company has not disclosed concrete numbers) and a market value of close to $25 billion. The company, led by Flickr co-creator Butterfield, started primarily as an email alternative that pitched itself to startups, media companies, and other tech-savvy businesses to better manage interoffice communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V5fmn"&gt;But Butterfield and his team grew Slack into a full productivity suite with video meeting features, file hosting, IT administration, and all manner of other features typically offered by large enterprise corporations. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21132060/ibm-slack-chat-employee-rollout-microsoft-teams-competition"&gt;expanded its partnership with IBM&lt;/a&gt; to include the company’s entire 350,000-plus workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcT8JD"&gt;However, Slack has also struggled in the face of fierce competition from not just Microsoft, but Facebook and other companies that have launched their own versions of office chat and productivity platforms. The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19. The company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRdk3j"&gt;Salesforce, also a major competitor to Microsoft but in the cloud sector, is worth nearly $220 billion and has grown to become one of the largest software companies on the planet, thanks to its customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage sales online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zI371u"&gt;Both Salesforce and Slack have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195092/slack-new-user-records-coronavirus-pandemic-remote-working-growth-concurrent-users"&gt;only become more vital during the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; as companies worldwide have moved to remote work and moved substantial portions of their businesses online. Yet, unlike Slack, which has seen a rollercoaster of climbs and steep drops in its stock price, Salesforce has only seen its market valuation expand in recent months. Its shares peaked at an all-time high in September. Salesforce and Slack joining together ensures both platforms can better compete against Microsoft, Oracle, and other cloud and enterprise companies in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals that are still happening</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7Lr5YMWFblzi49LBJtVT60pcb8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042448/4311_Cyber_Monday_Still_Get.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QychB"&gt;Cyber Monday may be a thing of the past, but some of its best deals are still happening. Many retailers will keep some of them going a little longer this week, now dubbed “Cyber Week.” Between now and the winter holidays, you can expect the non-stop barrage of deals to slow down a bit. However, in an effort to keep you coming back to snag those last-minute gifts, some stores may reintroduce this year’s best deals at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ypw7fr"&gt;Below, you’ll find a few good deals on wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, video games, and more. If you like where a price is at, it may be a good idea to make a purchase now, as these deals could end any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHCSuC"&gt;We’ll be doing our best to keep this post updated during Cyber Week, including adding new deals when they arrive, and striking through expired deals. And if you’ve been around these parts before and are just looking for what’s new, you’ll find those deals at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X2yB5s"&gt;Latest Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yjWMLx"&gt;AirPods Pro are back down to $190 at Woot, matching the deal we saw just before Black Friday. Woot guarantees that your order will arrive before Christmas on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="izeuIq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FHs7p6"&gt;If you missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21725110/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-earbuds-cyber-monday-deal"&gt;Woot’s incredible deal on the Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;, don’t worry, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1602829-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nzkaeue_galaxy_buds_live_mystic.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has the wireless earbuds on sale for $120&lt;/a&gt; in black and bronze. It is not the lowest we have seen these bean-shaped earbuds for, but still an incredible deal. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; also has the Galaxy Buds Live on sale starting at $129, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1722751386730213452" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the earbuds for $130.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mv6joD"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; rereleased earlier this month and during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the game was marked down to $35 on PS4 and Xbox at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-Day-Ichi-PlayStation/dp/B0886YWLC9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725320376438453805" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter providing you a free copy on Xbox One and the Xbox Series X / S if you own one of Microsoft’s next-gen consoles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This phone shares a few similarities to the 8 Pro, like the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. Though, it doesn’t have wireless charging and its camera array doesn’t quite stack up as favorably. Also, it has a 90Hz refresh rate display compared to 120Hz on the 8 Pro, and the display itself is smaller (about 6.5 inches versus 6.8 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juEMEl"&gt;Speaking of the OnePlus 8 Pro, Amazon recently knocked an extra $50 off the Black Friday sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re an existing Google Fi subscriber, you can upgrade to the 4A with 5G and get $150 off, knocking the price down to $349. Not bad, considering that’s the same price as the standard Pixel 4A that doesn’t have 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W4BrrQ"&gt;For the first time, Brydge has discounted its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D6XQX14/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;W-Touch standalone trackpad&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10. Normally $100, it’s down to $70.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KTKnrb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D6XS52J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;W-Type wireless, full-sized Bluetooth keyboard&lt;/a&gt; is discounted by $20, bringing the price down to $40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekCZCJ"&gt;Samsung’s 2TB 970 Evo Plus NVMe SSD is $250 at Newegg &lt;s&gt;and Best Buy&lt;/s&gt;, beating the lowest price by about $40. A PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD like this will fit in only certain kinds of motherboards (so check before you buy).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="J1aM8G"&gt;For an even faster M.2 drive that’s actually capable of delivering quicker read/write speeds for both PCIe 3.0 and motherboards with PCIe 4.0 support, Samsung’s 500GB 980 Pro NVMe SSD is $120 (usually $150) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GL575DB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sFtw50"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi mesh routers are steeply discounted, starting with the single unit that’s $135 instead of $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMKD6SM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $139 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592195825667221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Wonder Woman 1984 will be the first title that HBO Max streams in 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzA3OL50cdP8h0JuOGA1dawRnoY=/100x0:2290x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68127973/Screen_Shot_2020_12_01_at_3.22.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NCnGKK"&gt;When Warner Bros. announced in mid-November that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will be available on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day it premieres in select theaters, I groaned. Not because of the decision to bring the movie right to the living room — that’s the right call — but I knew that, at the time, all content on HBO Max still topped out at 1080p. Resolution is one area where the service badly trails its competitors. But it turns out, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will be the first title that starts to rectify that when it’s released on December 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGSIOG"&gt;Today, WarnerMedia announced that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will stream on HBO Max in 4K. The film will also support (depending on what your setup is capable of) Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and HDR10. The 4K stream will be available on “Apple TV 4K, Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, Amazon Fire TV Cube / 4K Fire TV Edition smart TVs, Chromecast Ultra, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and supported Android TV devices.” Notably missing from the list, of course, is Roku; HBO Max remains unavailable on Roku’s platform as the two sides remain unable to reach a deal to put it there. HBO Max &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, but it seems 4K support will have to wait on those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R33ZBC"&gt;Director Patty Jenkins encouraged viewers to “find the biggest highest quality screen” they can when watching the movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fhWZhh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Excited to announce that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WW84?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WW84&lt;/a&gt; will be the first film on HBO Max available in 4K Ultra HD, HDR 10, Dolby Vision AND Dolby Atmos! Can’t wait. IN THEATERS on Dec. 25th and exclusively streaming in the US on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@hbomax&lt;/a&gt;. PLEASE find the biggest and highest quality screen you can!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/wNREvcTUjB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wNREvcTUjB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PattyJenks/status/1333861228695875584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OU2GwP"&gt;This is the very start, and HBO Max will “expand these capabilities to further films and TV series, as well as adding support for additional devices, throughout 2021.” I really hope that WarnerMedia expedites that timeline as much as it can; competitors like Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and others already tick off all of the checkboxes that home theater enthusiasts care about. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every type of user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Android apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chromebook can be more useful than a mediocre Windows laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many of the best Chromebooks are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the Lenovo Chromebook Duet as the best Chromebook for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2020 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, Google Pixelbook Go, the Google Pixelbook, and the HP Chromebook x360. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UgFhp"&gt;An honorable mention is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous laptop with a unique color and 4K AMOLED display, which didn’t quite make this list because of its unfortunately short battery life. We’re looking forward to reviewing Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook with a thin 2-in-1 design, and the affordable IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook which has a unique chassis and an SD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;The Best Chromebooks in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Kzk7Pm"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyRBlc_lGNtkqv1-Yw1w1JfYnaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698824/mchin_181029_4126_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WtaeAS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7t2YpZ"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best budget Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyoOMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Asus Chromebook Flip C434" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYnULfa3HJrkV86b9C2G9N0GGc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138755/vpavic_190731_3630_0080_result.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vaH8VJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="h53Xe7"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: HP Chromebook x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_ywzr_RXTQ5_V71rLE_aoXdE6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138761/vpavic_190731_3630_0083_result.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best Chromebook Google has ever made is the Google Pixelbook Go, which has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is the best Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell Inspiron 14 is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, offering a sturdy build, backlit keyboard, and built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;7. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best Chromebook from Samsung is the Chromebook Plus v2, which has a microSD slot and an extra front-facing camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is one of the best Chromebooks for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited now lets you stream music videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXKy9mA4YL-d7W0yo2ENFrVDLN0=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68098258/Screenshot_20201201_131735_Amazon_Music.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvqPsZ"&gt;Amazon is adding a large vault of music videos to its Amazon Music Unlimited service. Unlike some competitors like YouTube Music, Amazon’s videos are only available to paying subscribers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/01/amazon-music-unlimited-subscribers-can-now-stream-music-videos-in-the-app/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — not listeners on the ad-sponsored free tier. But the selection seems on par with other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ifE4"&gt;You’ll now see music videos show up as their own section in search results and on artist pages. There will also be music video playlists to watch through. As with YouTube Music, there’s a toggle on the now playing screen to switch between the music video and just the audio of whatever you’re currently listening to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0LGXk"&gt;The debut of music videos comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583123/amazon-music-x-ray-trivia-song-tracks"&gt;Amazon brought its X-Ray feature to the service&lt;/a&gt; for US and UK customers in November as a way to display behind-the-scenes trivia and “fun facts” about currently playing tracks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8C0ZP"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited costs $8 monthly for Prime members and the standard $10 / month for non-Prime subscribers. That’s for standard streaming quality, and Amazon also offers an “HD” tier with lossless and hi-res streaming, which remains a unique offering compared to larger competitors Spotify and Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest shareholders sue over ‘toxic’ work culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9BuWQmhQZiwFE0bSZ6jB9Hadb8=/0x0:5329x3553/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68085150/1143515118.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9GwGmY"&gt;Pinterest shareholders are suing the company’s top executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, for allegedly enabling a culture of discrimination. The toxic work environment has hurt the company’s reputation, leading to a user boycott and financial harm, the complaint alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzODwN"&gt;The CEO “repeatedly placed himself before the Company, surrounding himself with yes-men and marginalizing women who dared to challenge Pinterest’s White, male leadership clique,” the complaint says. The company ignored or silenced employees who tried to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZllJkD"&gt;The plaintiff in the suit is the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, which oversees $8.5 billion in public assets, including retirement funds for thousands of Rhode Island teachers, firefighters, and nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIXESU"&gt;The suit claims Pinterest executives and board members breached their fiduciary duty by failing to respond to allegations of workplace discrimination. “Even when presented with widespread claims of race and gender discrimination at Pinterest, the [executives and board members] did nothing to address this misconduct,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNTsUD"&gt;Issues with Pinterest’s internal culture first surfaced in June, when &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks went public&lt;/a&gt; with allegations of racial discrimination and retaliation. The women helped lead some of Pinterest’s most high-profile initiatives, including banning anti-vax content and limiting the spread of plantation wedding posts, but were underpaid compared to white male colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS07W7"&gt;Two months after Ozoma and Banks came forward, Pinterest’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;former COO Françoise Brougher sued&lt;/a&gt; for discrimination and retaliation. She said she was left out of key meetings, given gendered feedback, and underpaid compared to her male colleagues, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When she spoke out about her mistreatment, she says she was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt6q4A"&gt;Brougher’s suit shined a spotlight on chief financial officer Todd Morgenfeld, who’d asked her “What is your job anyway?” in front of teammates and undermined her accomplishments in a performance review. When Brougher brought these complaints to Silbermann, he compared the conflict to “an old couple fighting over who would make coffee.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWGDWp"&gt;The shareholder suit says Pinterest executives violated securities law when they failed to disclose Brougher’s pay compared to male colleagues. This caused the company to file a “false and misleading” proxy statement to the SEC, deceiving investors about its compensation practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMfDSA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigated the finance team&lt;/a&gt;, finding new stories of unequal treatment for women and people of color at the company. McKenna Rogers, who worked there in 2018, said her manager asked inappropriate questions about her personal life, made a sex joke at a team happy hour, and retaliated when she tried to speak up. “After Rogers declined his advances and went to the HR department for help, her supervisor cancelled meetings, cut her off from work, and berated her,” the shareholder lawsuit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNImWR"&gt;This isn’t the first time shareholders have tried to hold companies accountable in the wake of significant press coverage. In September, Google’s parent company Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-settlement.html"&gt;settled a series of shareholder lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; claiming the company had created a toxic work environment where women were repeatedly sexually harassed. The complaints came after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?module=inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the company protected former executive Andy Rubin, paying him $90 million after he was investigated for sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMMQBv"&gt;Victoria’s Secret parent company L Brands also faced legal action after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; on the culture of misogyny at the company. Defendants hoped to get records and further investigate the firm, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-parent-company-sued-over-alleged-toxic-culture-2020-6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRBZku"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Pinterest spokesperson said: “Pinterest’s leadership and Board take their fiduciary duties seriously and are committed to continuing our efforts to help ensure that Pinterest is a place where all of our employees feel included and supported. We believe the actions we’ve initiated as well as the ongoing independent review regarding our culture, policies, and practices will help us achieve our goal of building a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze announces $20 smartwatch with nine-day battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aXwGFHQqliyIUp1qNbuVQ9zo2m0=/351x0:4149x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68067494/Two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfpKgF"&gt;Wyze, the smart home company best known for its range of budget internet-connected security cameras, has announced its debut smartwatch. The &lt;a href="http://wyze.com/wyze-watch.html"&gt;Wyze Watch&lt;/a&gt; will be available in two sizes — 44mm and 47mm — when it ships in the US in February 2021, and like the rest of the company’s lineup, it’s priced affordably at $20. Wyze’s announcement follows the release of the company’s first fitness tracker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150549/fitness-tracker-wyze-band-alexa"&gt;$25 Wyze Band&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VQcYM"&gt;The watch will ship with a fairly standard selection of smartwatch features, including blood oxygen monitoring, heart rate tracking, an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, nine-day battery life, activity and sleep tracking, and integration with Google Fit and Apple Health. However, the watch will also integrate with Wyze’s other devices; the company promises that it’ll support shortcuts to let you control products like its smart bulbs. It can also display your notifications, allowing you to read email previews and texts, though Wyze’s press release doesn’t explicitly say which mobile operating systems the watch works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0Y8dGFNTn1DFx_L7NmBQDbwVao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129850/Six.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 47mm version of the watch (pictured) comes with a 1.75-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-kyqWxAdqlw15Zhc_1nayvsDbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129849/Three.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze Watch will ship in February.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNdT9"&gt;In terms of specs, the 44mm Wyze Watch has a 1.4-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 320 and a 260mAh battery. The 47mm version has a 1.75-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 385 and a 300mAh battery. Both have 16MB of storage. Neither offer GPS tracking, or support for voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZuITm"&gt;It’s hard to see Wyze beating out competition from the likes of Apple or Samsung when it’s pricing its debut smartwatch at just $20. But if it can deliver on its modest promises to offer a simple, functional experience, then the Wyze Watch could become an attractive first smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board takes its first six cases</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9TKRb"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews Facebook moderation decisions, has &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/719406882003532-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-cases-and-appointment-of-trustees/"&gt;accepted its first cases&lt;/a&gt;. The six appeals involve content removed under Facebook’s hate speech rules, nudity ban, and misinformation policies. They’re now open for seven days of public comment, after which the board will determine whether the posts should have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxeF7l"&gt;Most of the cases involve users outside the US posting non-English content — a known &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight/facebooks-flood-of-languages-leaves-it-struggling-to-monitor-content-idUSKCN1RZ0DW"&gt;weak point&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook moderation — and at least two hinge on the nuance of someone publishing hate content to implicitly criticize it. One user posted screenshots of &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/30/malaysias-mahathir-post-on-french-killings-taken-out-of-context"&gt;offensive tweets&lt;/a&gt; from former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, for instance, allegedly to raise awareness of “horrible words.” Another post involved a user who shared an alleged Joseph Goebbels quote, but who appealed by saying they were comparing Goebbels’s words to a “fascist model” in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vx2pVL"&gt;Each case will be referred to a five-member panel that includes one person from the same region as the original content. These panels will make their decisions — and Facebook will act on them — within 90 days. The oversight board, whose &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-oversight/facebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-that-can-overrule-zuckerberg-idUSKBN22I2LQ"&gt;first members&lt;/a&gt; were announced in May, includes digital rights activists and former European Court of Human Rights judge András Sajó. Their decisions will be informed by public comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxV82"&gt;Five of the incidents were submitted by users, who have appealed over 20,000 decisions since the option opened in October. The last was referred by Facebook itself and deals with coronavirus-related misinformation — one of the platform’s touchiest subjects. Moderators removed a video that criticized French health officials for not authorizing unproven COVID-19 treatment hydroxychloroquine, which the video inaccurately referred to as a “cure.” The company later submitted it as “an example of the challenges faced when addressing the risk of offline harm that can be caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdJOTc"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has compared the Oversight Board to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870827/facebook-supreme-court-mark-zuckerberg-content-moderation-charter"&gt;a Supreme Court for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. It’s supposed to offer a fair appeals process for users who get their content removed — something that often feels missing on social networks, especially as they take stricter steps to remove false information or offensive speech. At the same time, it eases the pressure on Facebook to make moderation calls. Cases like the pandemic video decision, for instance, will set an independently decided precedent for when Facebook removes similar content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibUJJF"&gt;The Oversight Board — similar to the US Supreme Court — is largely supposed to interpret policies, not make new ones. Facebook has said it may also turn to the board for policy recommendations in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBRkWA"&gt;Many of Facebook’s problems involve the speed and scale of content moderation, not the exact nuances of interpreting its policies. The Oversight Board obviously can’t hear all the appeals cases, and we don’t know exactly how rank-and-file moderators will apply its rulings to everyday decisions. But it’s the start of a long-awaited experiment in managing Facebook (a little) more like a government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rXAoZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams gets an overhauled calling interface, CarPlay support, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qZoZZ"&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its calling features inside Microsoft Teams today. A new calling interface will now show contacts, voicemail, and calling history in a single location. It’s designed to allow Microsoft Teams to more easily replace your desk phone, with built-in spam call protection, reverse number lookup, and the ability to merge calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyMqEd"&gt;Microsoft Teams users will also be able to transfer calls between mobile and desktop soon, allowing people to quickly move locations in the middle of an audio or video call. The Teams app will let people join without audio on an additional device, or simply transfer the call and end it automatically on other devices. Microsoft says this particular feature will be available in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLcavWyrxelkRO0J7NYX_Cky9k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133229/microsoftteamscalling.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Microsoft Teams calling features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oSCK"&gt;People who regularly record meetings in Microsoft Teams will also see some new options. You’ll be able to record meetings to SharePoint or OneDrive, providing greater flexibility than being limited to Microsoft’s Stream service. That will also make it easier to share calls or transcripts with people outside a Teams organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RVOsY"&gt;Finally, Microsoft is also bringing CarPlay support to Microsoft Teams. This will allow cars with built-in CarPlay to control Teams and for people to use Siri to initiate or answer calls. It’s not clear when Microsoft Team will support Android Auto in the future, though.&lt;/p&gt;
