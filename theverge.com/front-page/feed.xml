    <title>Bird will double its size in Europe with massive $150 million spend</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLZjN2"&gt;Bird says it will spend $150 million on a major expansion in Europe. The Santa Monica-based scooter sharing company announced that it will bring its battery-powered two-wheelers to 50 new cities on the continent in the coming months, in addition to growing its fleet in its current markets. The move comes as scooter sharing continues to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/vc-investors-are-wild-for-europes-e-scooter-rental-startups.html"&gt;perform strongly in Europe&lt;/a&gt; amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKHvuW"&gt;To help oversee this new initiative, Bird is promoting to two employees to its executive team: Renaud Fages is named head of global operations; and Brendan O’Driscoll will be head of product, growth and data, overseeing both Bird’s global product strategy and its implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W9aZVI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtju1o"&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role not only in embracing micro-EVs, but in redesigning cities to safely promote their use,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKetJi"&gt;Bird said that portions of its $150 million investment will be spent “implementing the next generation of recycling and second life applications for vehicles, investing in industry-leading equity programs and securing partnerships across the region designed to improve transportation for all Europeans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJWo1A"&gt;Since it first arrived in Paris in 2019, Bird has seen huge potential for growth in Europe, with its more robust network of bike lanes and a culture less dependent on personally owned vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083751/bird-acquires-circ-electric-scooter-europe-asia"&gt;Bird acquired Circ&lt;/a&gt;, a leading electric scooter rental business in Europe and the Middle East, in January 2020. And the company now operates in over 50 cities on the continent, meaning this new investment will represent a doubling of Bird’s current footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmnPQn"&gt;But the company has also seen a number of setbacks too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335611/paris-electric-scooter-competition-lime-tier-dott-bird"&gt;Bird did not ultimately win one of the coveted permits&lt;/a&gt; to operate its scooters in Paris, &lt;a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-transport/tier-lime-et-dott-raflent-le-marche-londonien-de-la-trottinette-electrique-1294014"&gt;nor does it appear to be on track&lt;/a&gt; to be granted a license in London either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhZWav"&gt;Bird has grown increasingly reliant on revenue from its franchising program, in which the company sells its older scooters to small operators and takes a cut of each ride. The program, which is called Bird Platform, has led some operators to fall into deep debt, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has since launched Bird Platform in countries like Switzerland and Estonia, cheering investors who hope it will lower Bird’s labor and capital expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb8iV"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Bird was nearing a deal to raise more than $100 million in convertible debt from some of its existing investors. The debt, which could eventually be converted into stock, would help Bird avoid selling shares at a lower price than in earlier fundraising rounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7hy93"&gt;The company is also doubling down on direct-to-consumer sales, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448941/bird-air-electric-scooter-announce-price-specs"&gt;unveiling its $599 Bird Air &lt;/a&gt;last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India will reportedly introduce bill to make owning cryptocurrency illegal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TuZfbT6AJIj5UncEwNG4iLDVHmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971166/mdoying_180308_2373_0091still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1UM3B"&gt;India is reportedly moving forward with a sweeping ban on cryptocurrencies. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cryptocurrency-ban/india-to-propose-cryptocurrency-ban-penalising-miners-traders-source-idUSKBN2B60R0"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the country’s legislature will introduce a bill that criminalizes trading, mining, issuing, transferring, or possessing cryptocurrency. The bill is likely to pass if it’s introduced, giving India some of the world’s strictest digital currency laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFomoo"&gt;Under the plan, people who own these digital assets would have six months to liquidate their holdings. &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; source, a government official, didn’t specify the punishment for breaking the rules after that. But a 2019 government panel recommended a jail sentence of up to 10 years for cryptocurrency-related offenses. The official says the discussions are in their “final stages,” although there’s no strict timeline for introducing the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pTti"&gt;The Indian government &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANTVg2GJYkmVpDg-m9DEVgD9JUp1wMIZoZsO5FtdJPNvp8Mr_qb4UZrDQ695KbtwcFyZUdUASR1qhHDcg1ToEWe3YnwukJaWt-su65i9Q1fgaTcZUPUHWqwybgbgzDcQoR-Yl0PQkVw6zWfgErdSt3MhZDT-tHeUZLTzVsRgAy2M"&gt;outlined its plans in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it published an agenda for the upcoming legislative session. That agenda included banning “all private cryptocurrencies” in India, with some exceptions to promote the general use of blockchain technology. The goal is to roll out an official government-issued digital currency while outlawing private alternatives like Bitcoin — which reached &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-record-high-trades-as-high-as-59755-on-saturday-idUSKBN2B50B1?il=0"&gt;a record high&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, trading at $59,755.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn9Wbx"&gt;No other large country has implemented this kind of ban on cryptocurrency. China, which has some of the harshest policies, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-didnt-ban-bitcoin-entirely-says-beijing-arbitration-commission"&gt;prohibits trading coins&lt;/a&gt; but does not outlaw owning them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhCezp"&gt;The in-progress proposal follows a years-long fight between cryptocurrency traders and the Indian government. India’s central bank cracked down on Bitcoin in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43669730"&gt;banning banks&lt;/a&gt; from dealing in virtual currencies. Its Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/"&gt;overturned the decision&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, but it didn’t necessarily preclude passing a new, even stricter law — like what’s on the table now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook strikes News Corp deal to license news from Australian media outlets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISMtkvnt2MdvraASgbPRgaLmKiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971020/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCbuNr"&gt;Facebook last month shut off the ability for Australian users and media organizations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;share news links in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems the company’s extraordinary measure has resulted in a compromise for the most interested parties as media giant News Corp has &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/"&gt;struck a licensing deal with the social network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jgd8HD"&gt;Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is a multi-year one that gives Facebook’s news platform access to major News Corp Australia properties, including news.com.au, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;. Google similarly struck a deal with News Corp last month, as the threat of a new Australia law regulating tech company payments to news organizations loomed overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEl2Rb"&gt;Facebook’s news shutdown in Australia wasn’t designed specifically to increase pressure on News Corp. Instead, Facebook wanted concessions from the Australian government about the then-forthcoming media bargaining law, which stipulated that major tech platforms like Facebook and Google would need to pay news publishers to access their content. Google also threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia, but it ended up &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;striking its own deals instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1Mt8t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook pushed back against Australian’s media bargaining law, and it won&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1cTyAd"&gt;In a predictable turn of events, Facebook received its desired concessions, the largest of which involved negating the forced arbitration portion of the bill that Silicon Valley reviled if prior commercial agreements were struck, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;restored the ability to share news&lt;/a&gt;. Australia then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;passed the law&lt;/a&gt; and everyone more or less came out unscathed. Yet part of Facebook’s initial opposition to the law was that it gave the most powerful publishers too much negotiating power, and News Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/how-much-influence-does-the-murdoch-media-have-in-australia-20201015-p565dk.html#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20by%20academics,print%20newspaper%20readership%20across%20Australia."&gt;far and away the largest and most pervasive media conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nMYX"&gt;“Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s global policy chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; in a public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0K52d"&gt;Following the Australia showdown, Facebook said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;commit $1 billion to news industry deals over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; to foster partnerships with media organizations, with the unspoken stipulation that it not have to face another media bargaining law like Australia’s. (Facebook said it reserves the right to shut down news in Australia again if it so chooses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lb8fc"&gt;It appears Facebook and News Corp have made up, and this new deal will make News Corp-owned publishers accessible on the Facebook News platform in Australia. In addition to news.com.au and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which has a separate deal as a broadcast organization, News Corp says it’s also licensing content from major newspapers like &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; in Victoria, and &lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;, as well as numerous regional publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVvao9"&gt;“The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,” said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. “Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvNLI"&gt;“We’re glad to have this deal in place and look forward to bringing Facebook News to Australia,” wrote Faceboo’s global news partnerships chief Campbell Brown. Andrew Hunter, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia and New Zeland, said in a statement that “the agreements with News Corp Australia and Sky News Australia mean that people on Facebook will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp’s network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricut is limiting the use of its crafting machines with a monthly subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3o6SBYpD-XO0MJUHOsvroA4ZZo=/65x0:3263x2132/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970906/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_11.52.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C9ADxy"&gt;Cricut machines offer a customizable, automated way to speed up the precise cutting required in crafting projects, but the capabilities of these devices are about to be limited by an upcoming update. &lt;a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/new-features-and-updates-coming-to-design-space/"&gt;Cricut is updating&lt;/a&gt; the machines’ accompanying software, Design Space, by putting caps on uploads that could restrict the number of projects Cricut owners are actually able to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgJF0N"&gt;Getting a Cricut ready to cut requires using premade patterns or uploading original designs to an application called Design Space. That’s been free and unlimited for all users in the past, but now Cricut is limiting users to 20 free uploads per month. To upload more, owners will soon have to subscribe to Cricut’s Access Standard plan for $9.99 per month / $95.88 per year or Access Premium plan for $118.88 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnvzWl"&gt;Anything that’s previously been uploaded will be able to stay in Design Space without any changes or limits, but it’s important to understand that to use a modern Cricut, you need to use Design Space in some capacity. And Cricut machines themselves can cost anywhere from around $179 to $399, before the potential subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBSE6bVcM2KP01Dtz6Vi1wdk6Go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_11.39.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Cricut Explore Air 2, one of the many Cricut machines that require the use of Design Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OTAR0e"&gt;At its most basic, Design Space is required to upload designs created in other apps so they can be formatted to work with Cricut machines. For example, a pattern for a paper flower made in Adobe Illustrator or a logo sketched in Procreate can be uploaded so the Cricut machine knows where to cut on whatever material is being used, whether it’s paper, fabric, vinyl, or even wood. Design Space works on its own as a creation software, but if you subscribe, it becomes more fully featured, with access to exclusive fonts, images, and patterns. Even with the optional subscription for more features, many users still choose to create their work elsewhere and only use Design Space for preparation before cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmndz8"&gt;Now with this new upload limit, a subscription is needed to restore the functionality crafters original bought a Cricuit for: creating as many projects as needed, with the only limit being materials, rather than an arbitrary number set by a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yydrQY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wh1_EYJHCdY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=5&amp;amp;start=5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSPA1P"&gt;Beyond the ever-present, scary reality that companies can limit the capabilities of a product you “own” after the fact, multiple Cricut owners have contacted &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about an even more glaring problem: projects can often require multiple uploads to complete, meaning that 20 upload limit could be reached even faster. This could be because of user error or a complex project requiring multiple pieces, but for any person who uses a Cricut in their business, that means they could very well be forced to subscribe if they want to keep up their normal level of productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20nAVj"&gt;In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Cricut said it remains committed to its plan and “creating the best possible experience for [its] members”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OqdDB4"&gt;Cricut announced changes to our Design Space software, including new Offset and Project Collection features, as well as an update to personal uploads, limiting image and pattern uploads to 20 per month for members without a Cricut Access subscription. All users will still be able to design and cut regardless of uploads. Cricut remains dedicated to creating the best possible experience for our members, and we will continue to support our community of makers as our top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="564Jy5"&gt;The response to Cricut’s planned change is also boiling over on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cricut/"&gt;the company’s unofficial subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. Cricut users have shared the contact information of Cricut employees and launched &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/cricut-cricut-design-space-update-petition"&gt;a Change.org petition&lt;/a&gt; in protest of the upcoming update. Cricut says it will start prompting users to subscribe in Design Space in the next few weeks until the upload limit goes into effect at an unspecified date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies can silently reroute your texts to hackers, sometimes for just $16</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItHDnY_V1jYkVxkKkyUSYNDOJdY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970810/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tm63Om"&gt;There’s a newly discovered attack on SMS messaging that’s almost invisible to victims, and seemingly sanctioned by the telecom industry, uncovered in &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The attack uses text-messaging management services that are aimed at businesses to silently redirect text messages from a victim to hackers, giving them access to any two-factor codes or login links that are sent via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZYiLU"&gt;Sometimes, the companies providing the service don’t send any sort of message to the number that’s being redirected, either to ask permission or even to notify the owner that their texts are now going to someone else. Using these services, attackers are not only able to intercept incoming text messages, but they can reply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egjkJP"&gt;Joseph Cox, the &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reporter, had someone successfully carry out the attack on his number, and it only cost the attacker $16. When he contacted other companies providing SMS redirection services, some of them reported that they had seen this sort of attack before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGr2de"&gt;The specific company that &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;used has reportedly fixed the exploit, but there are many others like it — and there doesn’t seem to be anyone holding the companies to account. When asked why this type of attack is even possible, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon simply directed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to contact CTIA, the trade organization for the wireless industry. CTIA wasn’t immediately available for comment, but it told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it had “no indication of any malicious activity involving the potential threat or that any customers were impacted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xxie2"&gt;Hackers have found many ways to exploit the SMS and the cellular systems to get at other people’s texts — methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17695132/att-sued-over-lost-cryptocurrency-sim-swap-theft"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin"&gt;SS7 attacks&lt;/a&gt; have been seen in the wild for a few years now and have sometimes even been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;used against high-profile targets&lt;/a&gt;. But with SIM swapping, it’s pretty easy to tell that you’re being attacked: your phone will completely disconnect from the cellular network. But with SMS redirection, it could be quite a while before you notice that someone else is getting your messages — more than enough time for attackers to compromise your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcFGQV"&gt;The main concern with SMS attacks are the implications they could have for the security of your other accounts. If an attacker is able to get a password reset link or code sent to your phone number, they would then have access to it and be able to get into your account. Text messages are also sometimes used to send login links, as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; found with Postmates, WhatsApp, and Bumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTlhuP"&gt;This also serves as a reminder that SMS should be avoided for anything security related, if possible — for two-factor authentication, it’s better to use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy. Some password managers even have support for 2FA built in, like 1Password or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"&gt;many of the other free managers we recommend&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are still services and companies that only use text messages as a second factor — the banking industry is infamous for it. For those services, you’ll want to make sure that your password is secure and unique, and then push both for them to move away from SMS and for the cellular industry to work on making itself more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maybe don’t sell your friend’s art as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0C7eYWDTFab9qv9ZKnGPSs6TiM=/86x0:616x353/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970397/capsule_616x353.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJmThr"&gt;I get it — despite all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;warnings about climate change&lt;/a&gt;, you or someone you know has &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;Scrooge McDuck-sized dollar signs in their eyes after realizing a pinch of blockchain is all you need to turn a JPG image into cold hard cash, and now you’re casting about for something — anything — to turn into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt; while the initial gold rush lasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdMwew"&gt;Then, you spot it: something that doesn’t exactly belong to you. You’re not going to sell &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, right? And yet that’s kinda what indie game developer Jason Rohrer is attempting to do, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/game-artists-not-happy-that-developer-is-selling-their-1846465316"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: sell NFT copies of 155 digital paintings that he originally commissioned for his game &lt;em&gt;The Castle Doctrine&lt;/em&gt; as individual artworks online. Which... I mean &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; he’s legally got the rights, even though NFTs didn’t exist back then? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6SAuty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDAWfT"&gt;Except Rohrer isn’t even trying to pretend they’re his — he credits each artist on &lt;a href="http://thecastledoctrine.net/crypto.php"&gt;his new crypto gallery page&lt;/a&gt;, calling them his “personal friends,” and says he’s willing to “share” with them if they “bring in loads of auction money and back-end royalties.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6athpf"&gt;Some of his “friends” were not particularly happy about this level of generosity, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, and you should go read &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/game-artists-not-happy-that-developer-is-selling-their-1846465316"&gt;their biting responses in full&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s one to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7CjAo0"&gt;Canabalt and Overland developer Adam Saltsman described the NFT auction as a “a lose-lose proposition for me in the short term.” ”Either Jason does more gross public shit using my art, or else I have to like...talk to Jason, and spend some of my life doing that, which also sucks,” Saltsman told Kotaku in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oZtBfF"&gt;At press time, it’s unclear if Rohrer realizes the irony in continuing to use the phrase “PROTECT WHAT’S YOURS” as his website header image. (He has removed some pieces from the site at the artist’s request, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwwQBFDsOZNTvMY56VuQ-TJNsKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372734/headerFinal__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zO9kMd"&gt;I have to admit, I’m curious: would you ever buy an NFT from someone who &lt;em&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;produce the art? Since an NFT is effectively a digital autograph, I’d much rather own one from the original artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5x5hb"&gt;Perhaps that’s why no one has yet purchased &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/87283591157440911579395974666033012279231858385679051518079761392621806682113"&gt;this famous photo&lt;/a&gt; of a famous anonymous 4Chan post about how “literally anything can be art.” Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/2/11629454/this-post-is-art-framed-4chan-post-sells-for-90900-on-ebay"&gt;a framed copy of that post once sold&lt;/a&gt; for nearly $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc4WPjJ_4WifjwI8VfD_LBl-hk=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970393/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDRwsd"&gt;Microsoft Teams is currently down worldwide. Microsoft says it’s attempting to bring the service back online after “a recent change to an authentication system” took some Microsoft 365 services down. While a roll back to the change has taken longer than Microsoft expected, it’s now complete and Teams, Azure, and other Microsoft 365 services should be coming back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAD6y0"&gt;The issues started around 3:30PM ET, and Microsoft quickly confirmed they are affecting users worldwide. This is the first major Microsoft Teams outage since the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492688/microsoft-outlook-office-teams-azure-outage-down"&gt;went down back in September&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other Microsoft 365 services like Office 365 and Outlook. Microsoft also blamed its previous outage on a configuration change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0XyVE6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The update has finished deployment to all impacted regions. Microsoft 365 services are showing decreasing error rates in telemetry. We’ll continue to monitor service health status. Additional information can be found at &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEUj8uj65N"&gt;https://t.co/AEUj8uj65N&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1371581388508573698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVBRDR"&gt;Azure Active Directory also &lt;a href="https://status.azure.com/en-us/status"&gt;experienced issues&lt;/a&gt; as part of this outage, and Microsoft’s Xbox prepaid codes &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live-status"&gt;weren’t working&lt;/a&gt;, either. Xbox party chat continues to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1371572788436160514"&gt;intermittent for some users&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vecWP"&gt;WarnerMedia even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1371586952470921216"&gt;delayed the virtual premiere&lt;/a&gt; for Zack Snyder’s Justice League, due to Microsoft’s services outage today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ge5Zzl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Alas. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zc20uVC5b1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zc20uVC5b1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julia alexander (@loudmouthjulia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1371586952470921216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XEwYwC"&gt;Microsoft now has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million people using its Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; communications app every day. The service has grown rapidly during the pandemic, as students and businesses moved online for remote working and learning. As a result, a worldwide outage like this has now affected millions of people trying to use Microsoft Teams to communicate with co-workers, teachers, or fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3n3Ua"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, March 15th 6:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with latest information from Microsoft, and WarnerMedia delaying its virtual premiere due to the issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Summit B15 review: average business</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Functional but could be better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Z93JmH"&gt;This year, multiple companies primarily known for gaming laptops have been branching out into the portable business and productivity sector. It’s a crowded field already, but Razer made quite a splash with its excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;, which has an elegant chassis, a 16:10 screen, and just a touch of its company’s signature RGB lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC0P0f"&gt;In this review I’m looking at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"&gt;Summit Series&lt;/a&gt;, which is MSI’s attempt to enter the same space. The series includes the Summit E line — which includes discrete GPU options and is priced to compete with top dogs like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; — and the Summit B line, which starts at $999 and sits squarely in the midrange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwht5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10388520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60wLLz"&gt;I’m discussing the Summit B15 here — I looked at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"&gt;Summit E15&lt;/a&gt; last fall. The base B15 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. I tested the more expensive configuration, which costs $1,249 and has a Core i7-1165G7 (one of Intel’s top 11th Gen processors), 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The system puts solid specs in a nice chassis, but there are a few misses that make it a bit expensive for what it offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of MSI’s Summit B15 with the LED indicator on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcyVpFp3_M-FXJeQLEzBzKGvac8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361112/mchin_190604_4465_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 720p IR webcam does not support Windows Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad of the MSI Summit B15 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnGqU293H97TJqyVqJA_0P5fUng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361116/mchin_190604_4465_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the fingerprint sensor in the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj8JKW"&gt;The most appealing facets of the Summit-Series laptops are their look and build. They have a smooth black finish, an aluminum build, a classy backlit keyboard, and a lustrous new MSI logo on the lid and bottom bezel (no dragon to be found, a first for MSI). MSI claims the B15 has “military-grade durability,” and while that’s a difficult claim to test, there’s very little flex in the B15’s lid and keyboard. And at 3.53 pounds and 0.67 inches thick, it’s light for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeMIXg"&gt;All in all, though, the B15 has a bit of a utilitarian look, especially compared to the E15. The latter has some small flourishes that add up to a classier vibe — there are gold accents around the touchpad and edges of the hinge, for example, where the B15 is straight black. One other thing about the B15’s chassis — it’s one of the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen. Touch the lid one time, and a visible smudge will remain. I used the sides of my fists to reposition the laptop while taking photos and still had to wipe it down between shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqSPVs"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice-looking and nice-feeling chassis. But there’s nothing exciting about it, and you’ll be wiping it down a lot if you want to maintain a clean look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the right side, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJV_7SgZ1mzxrqBthkB7gIgMims=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361114/mchin_190604_4465_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-A and a microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xtyl99"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series looks like it was made for the boardroom","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"},{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series are slim business laptops for remote workers ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"},{"title":"MSI GS66 Stealth proves the RTX 3080 can handle QHD just fine","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pkezmy"&gt;The useful port selection is a highlight, given the thin chassis. It includes a USB-C (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, DP 1.4a, and USB 4.0), two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one combination audio jack, one microSD reader, and one HDMI jack, in addition to the barrel-plug power port. You also get an RJ45 Ethernet dongle in the box, which is handy. I also appreciate having USB-A ports on both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrLrJW"&gt;I also like the keyboard backlighting, which looks quite classy and wouldn’t be out of place in an office setting. The keys have a nice texture and 1.5mm of travel. Three nitpicks to note: First, the Fn key is half-sized, and I found it a pain to hit. Second, there was occasionally some internal rattle inside the deck, which was annoying. Third, the keys are more mushy than they are clicky, and they’re a bit shallower than the best keyboard keys around. Subjectively, I made more errors on this keyboard than I normally do. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdLDmTXjEX7et2zQFEYXP4aObF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361115/mchin_190604_4465_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audio jack, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, and power port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jv12Kr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I05xAM"&gt;The display, similarly, is functional with caveats. It covers 98 percent of the sRGB gamut and 76 percent of AdobeRGB, and it maxes out at 258 nits. That’s an acceptable range of color coverage and is functional enough for office use, but it’s too dim to use easily in bright settings. I would expect more from a $1,249 laptop. Additionally, it uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion among premium business laptops for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgrIZN"&gt;The one component I really don’t like is the touchpad. It’s a bit small for a 15-inch laptop, and I sometimes hit the fingerprint sensor (built into the top-left corner) and the top plastic as I was scrolling. It also isn’t the smoothest I’ve ever used, and my fingers would skid across it a fair amount. Both the material and the click feel a bit plasticky compared to what you might find in a nicer model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvUOq"&gt;The Summit’s performance is good. I didn’t encounter any problems while running it through my usual office work. The integrated Iris Xe graphics aren’t suitable for serious gaming but can run lighter fare if that’s your thing. I could occasionally feel the system chugging under the keyboard while doing more intense tasks, but it never got too loud or too hot. You can swap to the “Silent” cooling profile in MSI’s control panel if fan noise is bothering you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="dwmGAB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388525"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvQMX"&gt;With that said, two disappointments came out of my testing period. First, the audio from the B15’s two speakers isn’t terrible and works just fine for video calls, but it delivers tinny percussion and practically no bass. I also heard occasional distortion at maximum volume, though I could eliminate it by bumping the sound down a notch. My test unit’s microphone also wasn’t working on Zoom calls initially. It turned out Zoom had the wrong device set as the default input. If you run into this problem, clicking “Test Speaker and Microphone” before joining your meeting should resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pVB51"&gt;Second disappointment: the battery life. Running the B15 as my daily driver at 200 nits of brightness, I only averaged five hours and 13 minutes. This isn’t entirely unexpected, as it only has a three-cell 52Wh battery — similar to what some 13-inch laptops come with at this point. On this 15-inch laptop, it’s not enough to power you through a full day if your workload is similar to mine (around a dozen Chrome tabs, Slack, occasional Zoom call, that sort of thing). One thing to note is that the B15 comes loaded with Norton, which I’ve seen be a serious battery drain in the past. I ran a battery trial before uninstalling that software and only got four and a half hours. After I nuked the bloatware, the B15 got closer to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSXyYY"&gt;All told, the Summit Series is a fine first step for MSI. In a market where business-focused laptops commonly cost multiple thousands of dollars, there’s absolutely an audience for something like the B15, which is light, attractive, and functional for just over the $1,000 mark. It looks and feels like a laptop you’d bring to a business meeting, and it has a top Intel processor with cooling that can handle it. Professionals on a budget could certainly do worse. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Determined to succeed” is the Summit Series motto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="63sCEo"&gt;But given the unremarkable audio, battery life, and the other areas of the chassis, I still think that people who are willing to spend a bit more will benefit from doing so, especially folks who can live with less RAM and storage. A better screen, better speakers, and better battery life can make a big difference in the daily experience, and while the B15’s nice chassis, plentiful storage, and business-specific features are worth a premium for some folks, they won’t be everyone’s top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq7f0h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 4:29PM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated to include a resolution to an issue that I initially faced with Zoom audio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s new curved iDrive display is a ‘major step’ toward autonomous driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbYB-LEuEzXB16PSQdV7IhBo62s=/0x0:8065x5377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970330/P90415786_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bPBQIN"&gt;BMW is pulling the curtain back on its next iteration of iDrive, the software and infotainment platform that has served as the centerpiece of the automaker’s in-car experience for the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iZawX"&gt;The eighth version of iDrive will mostly live on a new “curved” display that starts behind the steering wheel and extends halfway across the dashboard. This involves merging the 12.3-inch instrument cluster and the central 14.9-inch infotainment screen into a single unit angled toward the driver. The size of the screen will vary, depending on the vehicle, but the screen will have the appearance of “floating,” the automaker said. The new iDrive will make its debut later this year in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;BMW’s new iX electric SUV&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162530/bmw-i4-electric-sedan-concept-geneva-motor-show-2020"&gt;BMW i4 electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="53lgip"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The brain of this car will also be a significant improvement over past models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Ykzp"&gt;The brain of this car will also be a significant improvement over past models, BMW says. The onboard computer will be able to process 20 to 30 times the data volume of previous models, or around double the amount of data that was previously possible. This will enable a greater fusion of the vehicle’s sensors, which will help enable higher levels of autonomous driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lP4pmp"&gt;According to BMW chief technology officer Frank Weber, iDrive is a “major step” toward fully autonomous vehicles. He explained that iDrive is designed to support both Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous driving systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvro0b"&gt;“It is not an evolutionary step from what we had in the [previous] generation,” Weber said. “It’s an all new, all new system when it comes to sensors, computing, [and] the way it was developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlgNQR"&gt;Advanced driver assistance systems, defined as Level 2 by the Society of Automotive Engineers, include lane keeping, blind-spot detection, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Most major automakers include some version of advanced driver assistance in their vehicles today. Level 3 refers to highly automated driving, also called conditional automation, where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xkctBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an all new, all new system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGKZWe"&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving. Audi, for example, said its A8 sedan would come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15952510/audi-a8-level-3-autonomous-driving-self-parking"&gt;a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot&lt;/a&gt; that, when active, would relieve human drivers of the need to pay attention during stop-and-go traffic. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/shift/why-level-3-automated-technology-has-failed-take-hold"&gt;But the feature was contingent on approval from local authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Jam Pilot remains dormant in most markets around the world. Audi has no plans to activate the feature, and Level 3 automation remains a morass of legal, regulatory, and business-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNWPCY"&gt;Weber wouldn’t say when BMW would introduce Level 3 automation and hinted it was conditional on racking up more test miles in vehicles equipped with the new version of iDrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S34xM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10393766"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7D9IS"&gt;“Nobody currently can offer at start of production Level 3 capabilities, because you need so many test miles,” he said. “And so you need a production vehicle, and then you run all your validation tests for Level 3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EyAQ"&gt;iDrive can be controlled with touch, voice activation, or gesture control. There are three main layouts: Drive, in which drivers can use a “dynamically changing area in the center of the information display to show individually selectable information”; Focus, “designed for extremely dynamic driving situations”; and Gallery, which minimizes the driving content “to clear as much space as possible for widget content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4ZOAM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HygksK"&gt;There is a theme of personalization that runs through the automaker’s new software update. BMW’s Personal Intelligent Assistant, built on top of Microsoft’s Azure cloud system, will “adjust to the driver’s individual needs and routines,” the company says, making it “a central operating channel of human-machine interaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHbWSW"&gt;The virtual assistant, which has been available in BMW’s cars for a number of years, will play the role of a “digital character which can engage in natural dialogue with the driver and front passenger – similarly to a relationship between humans.” Expect some similarities to Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX system or Volvo’s Android-powered Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw1URc"&gt;Using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, iDrive will be able to load a driver’s personal settings as soon as they start approaching the vehicle by sensing their key fob or smartphone. BMW describes this as a “great entrance moment,” which includes geometric projections, lighted door handles, and other lighting effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkfVE6"&gt;There will be three driving modes: sport, personal, and efficient. These control driving functions like engine throttle, steering characteristics, regenerative braking, and chassis settings, as well as internal and external sounds. New modes may be added via over-the-air software updates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZNB8u"&gt;Information about navigation, parking, and EV charging will be fully integrated into iDrive. BMW extends its theme of personalization to its mapping capabilities with a new feature called “learning navigation,” in which the vehicle will learn and anticipate the destination the driver is likely to head for next, based on the driver’s personal ID. This is meant to be a time saver, as well as a way to identify possible road hazards that may delay the journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwhKl3"&gt;iDrive will support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly, the company said. For several years, BMW had the dubious distinction of being one of the few automakers to charge its customers an annual fee to mirror their smartphone’s display on their car’s infotainment screen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;BMW reversed that decision in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and since then offers both CarPlay and Android Auto to its customers for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk produced a techno track about NFTs he’s selling as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axKfWQkvxZYNOZ9kVBSt7_HJpkM=/0x0:1114x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_3.56.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ko8hvU"&gt;Elon Musk is getting in on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT gold rush&lt;/a&gt; by selling a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893"&gt;new electronic music track&lt;/a&gt; he’s apparently produced as an NFT. Yes, you’ve heard that right — it’s a song about non-fungible tokens, which Musk appears to have minted (or plans to mint) on the blockchain. Musk did not include a link to the NFT, so it’s not clear if it’s already live or if Musk plans to initiate the sale at a later date. It’s also not clear on which platform Musk intends to sell the NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfuM9D"&gt;We also don’t know if the song has a name, but we have some clues. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893"&gt;looping video&lt;/a&gt; attached to the song Musk posted to Twitter on Monday displays the words “Vanity Trophy” orbiting around a golden orb affixed to the top of a literal trophy reading “HODL,” short for the phase “hold on for dear life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HyBl9u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m selling this song about NFTs as an NFT &lt;a href="https://t.co/B4EZLlesPx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B4EZLlesPx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1371549960030842893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQaUzw"&gt;The HODL acronym, though it’s believed to have potentially originated as a drunken misspelling of the word “hold,” is both online slang and a kind of rallying cry for the bitcoin community, because it ostensibly encourages crypto enthusiasts not to sell their tokens. It’s worth noting here that Musk is a huge proponent of bitcoin. Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; last month and plans to accept it as form of payment for its electric vehicles in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x8kGe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8WhCUe"&gt;At various points in the short video, the words along the trophy shift from “computers” to “never sell” while a female vocalist sings lyrics over top like “NFT for your vanity” and “computers never sleep.” Did I mention that the trophy also has little gold dogs, or “doges” if you will, rotating around it, too? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Omobeh"&gt;As for the song itself, well... there’s not a lot to say. It’s loosely a techno song if you want to dig into the genre (with some electro house vibes thrown in), and that’s appropriate considering Musk named himself the “technoking” of Tesla in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;real filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMwTPG"&gt;It’s not very good, though by the standards of Musk’s previous work in the electronic music scene — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116427/elon-musk-song-edm-soundcloud"&gt;certifiable not-quite-a-banger “Don’t Doubt ur Vibe”&lt;/a&gt; — I’d say it’s an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
