    <title>Poly’s new monitor has a built-in mic, camera, and even lighting for video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bUvUYO2YSHBpz7oVr5eR5w-dMG8=/0x0:1613x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761456/Studio_P21_In_call_Lifestyle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poly’s P21 display has a built in webcam, microphone, speakers, and lighting.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Poly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mN7yuw"&gt;Poly, the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;brand launched&lt;/a&gt; after headset-manufacturer Plantronics bought video conferencing company Polycom &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/02/1532616/0/en/Plantronics-Completes-Acquisition-of-Polycom.html"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is announcing a new lineup of office gear for the work-from-home era. There’s the $129 Poly Studio P5 webcam, the $599 Poly Studio P15 Personal Video Bar, and the $815 Poly Studio P21 Personal Meeting Display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnaohW"&gt;The P21 display is particularly interesting. Although it’s fundamentally a 21-inch monitor, it’s designed to make the most of video calls. It’s got a built in webcam with a physical privacy shutter, microphone, and integrated stereo speakers. There’s even a pair of ambient lights on its left and right sides to keep your face well-illuminated on video calls. Its stand doubles as a wireless charger, and there are video call shortcut buttons along the bottom of the screen, including one to quickly mute your microphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca12Eu"&gt;There’s no mention of the monitor’s resolution or panel type &lt;a href="https://www.poly.com/us/en/products/video-conferencing/studio-p/studio-p21?utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_source=press_release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GL-PS-FY21Q4-OzProductLaunch%E2%80%94EN&amp;amp;cnid=7013t000001l3I1"&gt;on its product page&lt;/a&gt;, and Poly is specifically pitching it as a “second or backup display” despite advertising it as “pro-grade.” So suffice it to say, this probably isn’t going to replace your main monitor anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex7nMzlL-D3HysGKaeuo0NASNSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278097/Studio_P15_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jzZA0mm_B0RunKBQ4b_n1VVVRX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278098/Studio_P5_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poly Studio P5 webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMJJmE"&gt;The P15 Personal Video Bar is a 4K webcam (capable of automatically keeping you in frame) with a built-in speaker and microphone. Then there’s the Poly Studio P5, a 1080p webcam with up to 4x digital zoom, and a built in USB Type-A connector that lets you plug a headsets’ wireless receiver directly into the back of the camera. Both cameras have built-in privacy shutters. It’s also selling bundles of its Studio P5 webcam with an included headset or speakerphone, starting at $149.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjYOdC"&gt;Poly has been in the video conferencing business for a while, first as Polycom, and as Poly since &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;its 2019 rebrand&lt;/a&gt;. Its latest product launch follows a huge increase in the amount of people working from home which is expected to continue long after the immediate health dangers of the pandemic pass. The last year has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21199521/webcam-shortage-price-raise-logitech-razer-amazon-best-buy-ebay"&gt;seen webcam shortages&lt;/a&gt; as people upgraded their home video calling setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aedALW"&gt;All three new products will be available beginning in April, Poly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HX1KA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqiwUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony sold 4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5AZ__pvMlw_E9osPwEfPdXr1Vs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761261/vpavic_4278_20201030_0301.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gxWfOb"&gt;Sony shipped 4.5 million PlayStation 5 units worldwide in 2020, as revealed by information &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q3_supplement.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; alongside the company’s latest earnings report. The number highlights Sony’s current ability to mass-produce the console, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;extremely difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; since its launch in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZv49A"&gt;Demand for the PlayStation 4 dropped dramatically year-on-year, with 1.4 million units shipped in the October-December quarter — a 77 percent decrease from the previous year. Sony actually managed to sell fewer PS4s in the holiday quarter than it did from July to September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lglW5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best quarter in PlayStation history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VI9X02"&gt;Sony’s gaming business overall performed much better than a year ago, with analyst Daniel Ahmad &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1356860649402425344"&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; that it was actually the best quarter in PlayStation history. Revenue increased 40 percent to 883.2 billion yen ($8.4 billion), partly driven by PS5 sales. Operating profit was up by 50 percent to 80.2 billion yen ($763.3 million) because of higher game sales, PlayStation Plus subscriptions, and better margins on PS4 hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2H7Fd"&gt;Sony does note, however, that expenses related to the PS5 launch offset some of its profit gains, and also confirms that the PS5 hardware itself is being sold for less than it costs to make. A loss was incurred due to “strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than the manufacturing costs,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZV4S3"&gt;There’s not much to read into PS5 sales numbers until people who want to buy one are actually able to do so. But at the very least, the console’s launch seems to be broadly comparable in size to the PS4’s; the PS4 also shipped 4.5 million units in its launch quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj8lNK"&gt;Microsoft didn’t release specific sales figures for the Xbox Series X or Series S with its earnings report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, but the company did say that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s next folding phone is coming on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkhnGnxiwkQIkLnmrqkWocgmnoU=/0x0:690x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761147/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KEqkw4"&gt;Huawei will announce a new flagship foldable phone later this month, according to a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K0bsQcYma"&gt;Weibo post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s official page. Based on the name, the Mate X2 sounds like it should be a more substantial followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;original Mate X&lt;/a&gt; than Huawei’s last foldable phone, the faster and slightly tweaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lFCft"&gt;Unless Huawei is being deliberately cryptic, the teaser image for the Mate X2 actually suggests that the phone could possibly switch to a different folding screen design with the flexible panel on the inside, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Mate X phones had a single panel that wrapped around the outside when closed, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole’s Flexpai devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzTHsP"&gt;Otherwise, there’s not much in the way of details on the Mate X2 yet. It’s likely that it’ll have the same Kirin 9000 processor found in the Mate 40 Pro, and of course Huawei probably still won’t be able to include Google apps and services on board, limiting the device’s viability outside of China unless something changes unexpectedly quickly with the new Biden administration’s approach to sanctions. Huawei’s hardware is always worth paying attention to, though, so stay tuned for more news and details on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This hypercar is China’s first Belt and Road electric vehicle project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGjN1FpR9y9fq633G-tmexhqCig=/0x61:2047x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761011/473ADF4A_12AD_49FD_A400_E6F67E8D930A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Silk EV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QaDl3Y"&gt;A new engineering and design startup called Silk EV headquartered in Italy’s venerable Motor Valley is more than just another attempt at making an electric hypercar. It’s also the latest arrow in the quiver for China’s massive Belt and Road project, though the first that deals with electric cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN9aT0"&gt;Silk EV announced on Tuesday that it will co-develop an “ultra-luxury hypercar” called the S9 in the home region of Lamborghini and Ferrari with First Automobile Works (FAW), China’s original state-owned automaker. The S9 will be part of the Chinese automaker’s longstanding Hongqi brand, which means “red flag” and was once exclusively made for high-ranking Chinese government officials before becoming more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgOVz7"&gt;The two companies didn’t release any specifications about the S9, or any photos, save for a teaser image. In a press release, Silk EV said the vehicles it makes with FAW will “combine a dynamic, sustainable, and exclusive driving experience with the use of cutting-edge technology and innovation, delivering to China and the world the next-generation of luxury new energy vehicles.” One of the few things announced Tuesday is that the car is being designed by Walter de Silva, who has styled vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Audi, and Lamborghini, and headed up design for the Volkswagen Group in the late 2000s and early 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxAZET"&gt;China’s Belt and Road initiative is a massive effort to spin up infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe, and Africa that, in total, roughly trace the old Silk Road. The projects span dozens of countries and vary in size and scope. There are massive railways, hydropower plants, dams, and bridges. And in some places, like Djibouti, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11304.pdf"&gt;China is attempting to do nearly all of the above&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JowODN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Belt and Road has, until now, been more about infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysxqGA"&gt;While the Chinese government frames the Belt and Road initiative as one &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OubM8bD9kck"&gt;ripe with diplomatic and economic opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, the country has been accused of saddling some of its smaller partners with debt, leaving them susceptible to Beijing’s influence. Other projects have been criticized for favoring, or even requiring, the use of Chinese construction companies during &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative"&gt;unusually opaque bidding processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu9Pap"&gt;The best of China’s many EV startups have long aimed to expand outside the country, though only one — XPeng — has followed through on that promise &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;after beginning deliveries to Europe in December&lt;/a&gt;. Larger, more established automakers have kept their focus on exploiting the vast opportunity for consumer electric vehicles inside China, especially after the government began favoring clean energy vehicles a few years ago. (Commercial vehicles are a different story; major automaker BYD, for instance, sells electric buses in the US.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd8zvF"&gt;With electric vehicle technology maturing, and China controlling the bulk of the supply chain, an outward expansion from an established player only makes sense. And FAW is an unsurprising partner for Silk EV. Not only is the company’s Honqi brand recognizable throughout China, but FAW has shown an interest in electric vehicles, having helped kickstart EV startup Byton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W5O7c"&gt;Byton once had its own global ambitions. But it ran into financial trouble last year and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;now retreating from the US&lt;/a&gt; and reportedly being rolled up into FAW. (Former CEO of Byton Carsten Breitfeld, who now helms Faraday Future, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875328/byton-carsten-breitfeld-first-auto-works-chinese-government"&gt;accused the Chinese government of exerting influence on the startup through FAW in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HApV4u"&gt;While Italy makes sense as a target market to make and sell a hypercar, it’s also a logical political partner for a project like this, as it was the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-china-president-idUSKCN1R40DV"&gt;first G7 nation to endorse the Belt and Road initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epV2j"&gt;Xu Liuping, the chairman and party secretary of FAW, said in a press release that the joint venture with Silk EV “marks a major milestone under the Belt and Road initiative for China, Italy and the global automotive industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPUoWn"&gt;“It is a unique opportunity for FAW to build on its legacy of carmaking excellence in Jilin province — the center of China’s automotive industry — and for FAW Group to come together with Italy’s Motor Valley — renowned for its luxury and racing automotive heritage, integrated ecosystem, and world-class engineering — to become the new benchmark in new energy vehicles,” Xu said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Cyberpunk 2077 security exploit makes installing mods risky business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3YvDPiRl_8CpmUj2bTUEkT02yU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760452/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiPRVQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red has warned players that installing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; mods or custom save files on the PC could pose a security risk (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the company’s tweet, there’s apparently a “vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs.” The game’s official mod tools were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252373/cyberpunk-2077-official-mod-support"&gt;just released last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcAmqN"&gt;The company warns users not to install files from unknown sources, though &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that pretty much rules out all mods unless you can read and understand their code. When you’re dealing with a vulnerability that could potentially lead to arbitrary code running on your computer, it’s probably best not to risk it until a fix is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="slw3Z0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you plan to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CyberpunkGame&lt;/a&gt; mods/custom saves on PC, use caution. We've been made aware of a vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs. Issue will be fixed ASAP. For now, please refrain from using files from unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED CS (@CDPRED_Support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPRED_Support/status/1356604047671898112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5n7rV"&gt;This isn’t the first problem CD Projekt Red has faced with the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; mod system — the company also had to ask players to stop installing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253112/cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves-sex-mod-ban"&gt;mods that allowed them to have sex with Keanu Reeves’s character.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GameStop stock roller coaster has come to the dip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jw82xSwkSVKVbtxGqKKUfAJ689k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760120/slack_imgs.com.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbFmvo"&gt;It hasn’t been a good day for WallStreetBets, as GameStop’s stock has plummeted today. AMC, the community’s other bet, dropped as well. But unlike previous dips, the stocks don’t appear to be rallying. Prices stayed low for the entire trading day, something that hasn’t happened since WallStreetBets became a household name one week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIMZV"&gt;When the market closed today, the price of GameStop was $90 even, an 81 percent drop from GameStop’s peak at $483, and a 58 percent drop from its price of $218 on Friday evening. AMC is down too, closing today at $7.82, which is a 61 percent drop from its peak at $19.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDB84w"&gt;It’s hard to believe that in August of last year, GameStop was trading at $4.50. Between then and last week, some investors bet that the stock was undervalued, driving it up to around $30 a share. Then, the WallStreetBets subreddit decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;it would take the stock to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, punishing those betting against it and attempting to make money in the process. The idea of buying at $4 a share and selling for $400 obviously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;captured the public’s imagination&lt;/a&gt;, and millions rushed to give trading a try as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;the GameStop meme&lt;/a&gt; went mainstream — taking AMC and others along for the ride as investors realized they could pump those stocks too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it’s not the same picture, just the same shape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T82PDq"&gt;As to whether this is the end of GameStop’s wild ride, it’s almost impossible to tell. The past week’s peaks, dips, and drops have been detached from the underlying businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfZbAJ"&gt;Part of that is the culture of WallStreetBets itself. Praising people for not selling their stocks, and ridiculing those that do is a recipe for a community that’s going to be stubborn. And now it’s started telling itself that the drop is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/"&gt;due to hedge fund market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owGj8F"&gt;If this news has made you feel like reading about other stock market shenanigans, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; has an article &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html"&gt;that compares what’s happening now to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze&lt;/a&gt;, and Vox’s &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22262271/gamestop-bubble-robinhood-henry-blodget-interview"&gt;has an interview with Henry Blodget&lt;/a&gt;, who was involved with the Dotcom bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWQ7E"&gt;As for the people who have deep losses from today’s dive? They’re hoping for a rally, so they can at least sell for what they bought in for. Some, like Dutch student Evan Oosterink, are counting on it — he bet about $10,000, which represented “years of savings from his parents and some government college loans,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/gamestop-stock-plunge-losers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt; He lost about $9,000 today, but is still holding the stock in the hope that he can recoup his loss. “Being a part of WallStreetBets, it’s like a religion you’re devoted to,” he said to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VfUu0E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was lovely reading those stories on Reddit about how GameStop stock changed their lives and will help them pay medical bills, save pets etc and I really, really, really hope they sold &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kcjwf4NNnN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kcjwf4NNnN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1356615785280602119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next macOS Big Sur update should make iPad apps look less awkward on the Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eiVcuQ_-cPPj7W5HLErWfl5YFQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760005/akramer_201113_4290_0023.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEfu9W"&gt;Apple just yesterday released its latest update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; with improved Bluetooth reliability and a handful of bug fixes. And today, it’s rolling out the first beta of macOS Big Sur 11.3, which will bring further refinements to Safari, Reminders, Apple Music, Apple News, and other apps. This update will also try to improve the experience of running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs, which can still be a little awkward at this early stage (and without a touchscreen display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxHDgd"&gt;iPadOS apps will now appear larger than before — if your screen size allows for it — and beta testers will find a new preference pane for iPhone and iPad apps that’ll let them better personalize the “touch alternatives” keyboard commands. Touch alternatives allow for “keyboard alternatives for tap, swipe, and drag gestures, and enables multi-finger gestures using the option key and a trackpad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c8j3Kj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TPnC0Y"&gt;Big Sur 11.3 will make Safari’s start page more customizable, letting you rearrange the different sections (favorites, Reading List, Siri suggestions, etc.) to your own liking. Developers will gain the ability to make extensions that run on the new tab page, and they can also take advantage of a new web speech API to integrate speech recognition on their web pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASHWiF"&gt;As for the Reminders app, you’ll be able to sort your reminders based on title, due date, priority, or creation date. And with this update, Apple will let you easily &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; your reminders if a paper copy might prove helpful when running to the store or completing other tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3YSYK"&gt;Apple Music gets small tweaks like a shortcut to your “Made for You” personalized playlists and mixes. Live and upcoming special events will be highlighted in the For You tab, as well. The Apple News app is undergoing some design improvements in the Apple News Plus tab to make your magazines and newspapers easier to reach (and download). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMd199"&gt;And like the upcoming iOS 14.5 update, macOS Big Sur 11.3 adds support for the latest Xbox and PlayStation DualSense controllers; the same compatibility is coming to Apple’s mobile devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;as part of iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another SpaceX Starship nails clean test flight, but explodes on landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8npTmWOZcXIP4itqoW_RehdKC4=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759903/spaceship_crash_space_x.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NofPJn"&gt;SpaceX’s latest Starship prototype launched on Tuesday, soaring miles above its South Texas facilities in a successful flight demonstration before exploding during the landing attempt. It’s the second failed landing in a row, after a previous prototype, SN8, launched and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;failed to stick the landing in December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5wSAQ"&gt;This week’s launch demo — one of many in the books already — follows weeks of tension between SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration, which approves test launches like this one. During its high-altitude test launch with SN8 two months ago, the company violated its FAA launch license. This triggered an investigation that held up today’s SN9 flight and frustrated SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a7ctV8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX launched the thing anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UKOxg"&gt;In a statement Tuesday morning announcing SN9 was clear to fly, the FAA confirmed the previous violation: Before SN8 launched, the agency had denied a request from SpaceX to waive public safety limits associated with the flight, but SpaceX launched the thing anyway. It’s still unclear what safety limits SpaceX wanted to waive in connection with the launch. The FAA declined to specify and SpaceX has yet to respond for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeUvD1"&gt;On Tuesday, with fresh FAA approval for a flight plan that “complies with all safety and related federal regulations,” the 16-story-tall rocket lifted off from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas test facilities around 3:30PM ET under clear skies, reaching an altitude of 6.2 miles (10km) — a bit shorter than SN8’s target altitude of 7.7 miles. After that, SN9 shut down its three engines to begin a free-falling dance back to Earth, tilting on its side to test new aerodynamic flaps and attempt a “belly flop” maneuver. If all had gone well, the rocket would have landed vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lto3dKdhzczNI3XoXx12q_ZheY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277204/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.31.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SN9 just before it’s untimely end.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Otrm3I"&gt;Instead, SN9 slammed into the ground at a roughly 45-degree angle, perishing in an explosive fireball just like SN8. “We had another great flight up to the 10km apogee... we’ve just gotta work on that landing a little bit,” said SpaceX engineer John Insprucker, who usually only narrates the company’s live video feeds for routine Falcon 9 launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwpek7"&gt;The FAA opened an investigation into the SN9 landing explosion, it said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that “although this was an uncrewed test flight, the investigation will identify the root cause of today’s mishap and possible opportunities to further enhance safety as the program develops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vv6h8"&gt;The landing explosion sprayed debris on SN10, another Starship prototype that stood ready for SpaceX’s next test flight. The company wheeled SN10 out of its towering, rocket-shaped facilities last Friday night to make room for future prototype construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAqbfO"&gt;On the live stream, Insprucker reminded SpaceX’s audience that the SN9 flight, though it ended in a dramatic explosion, was a test, and a number of test objectives were met. It was the “second time we’ve flown Starship in this configuration, we’ve got a lot of good data, and the primary objective to demonstrate control of the vehicle in the subsonic re-entry looked to be very good. And we will take a lot out of that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iCloud for Windows version that let you sync Apple passwords is no longer available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENAPCS-OGtplT01iFYBniRzXrSI=/0x191:1646x1288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759891/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_2.06.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aRJcj0"&gt;Apple’s rocky rollout of iCloud password sync on Windows has hit another bump: you can no longer download the version of the app that allowed syncing passwords from your Apple devices with your Chrome web browser on a Windows PC (&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-pulls-update-supports-icloud-keychain-windows-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmexperts+%28Windows+Central%29"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Version 12 of Apple’s iCloud for Windows app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;released last week with supposed support for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, but the Chrome extension to make it work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;wasn’t available until two days ago&lt;/a&gt;. Now, version 12 is gone from the Windows Store, with version 11.6 taking its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zfrDY"&gt;Weirdly, the changelog on the Windows Store still says that the password syncing functionality is present. However, upon downloading, the app shows the version as 11.6 in the top right. We verified this for ourselves, and you can see there’s no password sync option in our first screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7oNrUboWdOSOEC6x_1IIm2O0NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277292/icloud_11_6_windows_store.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The version of the app we downloaded today, 11.6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_KytxKImNL0D4_h7hiRU8q4Gms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263753/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Version 12 of the app with the passwords option, downloaded January 27.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YwPEQX"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/apple-pulls-icloud-12-icloud-passwords-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the late-to-the-party Chrome Extension is still available on the Chrome Web Store, at least for now. Anyone still on version 11 of the iCloud for Windows app, though, won’t be able to upgrade and take advantage of the extension anyhow. But if you currently have version 12 on your computer, Windows won’t make you downgrade to the previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ4mX"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple pulled the update — the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj/"&gt;reviews for the Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; aren’t good, but many of them are users reporting that it doesn’t work on Mac, which it’s not designed for. Whatever the reason, this has been one of the messier rollouts I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory. The story, it seems, is the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;the last time I wrote about iCloud Passwords for Windows&lt;/a&gt;: if you want them, you’ll have to wait a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38qlEt"&gt;Apple was didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is stopping some people from posting feed photos to stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ScEb4_-npAzLyPdoND6uGBMCPqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759782/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQe0RZ"&gt;Instagram is disabling the ability to share (and reshare) posts from your feed to stories as part of a test to see how it changes engagement with the popular feature. The company announced the change in a notification banner sent to users in “select countries” where the test is being conducted, &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-tests-removing-the-option-to-share-feed-posts-within-stories/594255/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Media Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;writes. We’ve reached out to Instagram for specifics on exactly which countries are participating and will update if we hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvh9UE"&gt;“We hear from our community that they want to see fewer posts in Stories,” the notification starts. “During this test, you won’t be able to add a feed post to your Story.” Resharing posts to stories is a fairly common practice, though it does create situations where you’ll see a post in your feed and then immediately see that post duplicated in your friend’s stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xEelxU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;instagram users: I wish people stopped sharing so many feed posts to their Stories&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;instagram: &lt;a href="https://t.co/KQkBbVY45v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KQkBbVY45v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1355090232316743685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6l7VZq"&gt;However annoying this situation may be, it’s worth noting that sharing posts to stories is how many artists, businesses, and organizations get in front of users, due to Instagram’s algorithm favoring friends and family. For example, shoving feed posts in stories opens up the opportunity for the mutual aid organization in your neighborhood to get more donations. Taking away the ability to reshare is responding to a behavior Facebook and Instagram encouraged in the first place by placing stories so prominently in the app and offering the ability to share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWIPWw"&gt;For now, disabling reshares remains a test, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;the changes to likes&lt;/a&gt; the company considered and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/10/21429144/instagram-redesign-test-reels-shopping-adam-mosseri-interview"&gt;the variety of new app layouts it has prototyped&lt;/a&gt;. But the timing is a bit ironic: Twitter is currently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1337111365757100033?s=20"&gt;testing the ability to share tweets to Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt; as stickers. So you might start seeing a lot more reshares in your stories from an entirely different social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7UHfl"&gt;
