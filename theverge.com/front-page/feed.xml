    <title>Ditto’s true form is this comfy chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76plLvYqZtwhlNoHH6q-xWa6uaI=/96x0:1953x1238/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455760/EoV6U3HXMAERXJj.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cAidnN"&gt;A Ditto chair is on its way to Japanese retailers. It exists somewhere on the spectrum of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14251970/pikachu-stuffed-doll-toy-weird-melting"&gt;big gut Pikachu&lt;/a&gt; and a bean bag chair, and, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pokejungle/status/1334607368089427972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1334607368089427972%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fditto-has-morphed-into-a-chair-for-your-home%2F"&gt;PokéJungle&lt;/a&gt;, it costs roughly $250. The whole situation is a nice lavender and appears very, very squishy. Just behind your seated body looms Ditto’s eternal smile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aNfpN"&gt;As a pokémon, Ditto’s whole schtick is imitating &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; pokémon. It turns into anything it wants, albeit with the same unnerving, wide-mouthed smile of its blubbery purple form. You’ll notice I did not say &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; form because I humbly submit that it’s this Ditto chair. While likely not canon, it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0d8Tae"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;they made a ditto chair, so 2020 is saved! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mU84xrSFQe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mU84xrSFQe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ☃️ (@Rokashi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rokashi/status/1334876871079694338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq2woP"&gt;I’m right about this. No questions at this time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube hit Ryan’s World comes to Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o-TIL6yT9KuOTY16yT3Q598gZE=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455644/RW_Roblox_Characters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9xEIc"&gt;Ryan’s World is expanding to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. The hit YouTube channel is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F4882738396%2FRyans-World-Launch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F4%2F22152447%2Fryans-world-roblox-level-youtube-ryan-kaji#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching its own virtual world&lt;/a&gt; inside the popular kids game, which allows players to create their own spaces and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrjFWS"&gt;Players will be able to drop into a sprawling digital world inspired by the YouTube show and explore a racecourse, a fire station, a beach, and a school, among other locations. There’s also a Rainbow Road-esque path into space and a strange box labeled “MYSTERY PETS.” The game world is supposed to launch on December 5th at 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAv8F8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been around for more than a decade, but the game’s popularity has soared since the beginning of the pandemic. It now has 31.1 million daily users, up 82 percent year over year, and the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;filed to go public&lt;/a&gt;. As it’s grown, more and more mainstream names have carved out a space inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to meet its huge audience. Lil Nas X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557275/lil-nas-x-roblox-virtual-performance-announced-holiday-old-town-road"&gt;performed a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; there in November, and the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594054/ready-player-two-roblox-treasure-hunt-ernest-cline"&gt;hosted a treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; to tie in with the release of &lt;em&gt;Ready Player Two &lt;/em&gt;earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ryan’s World in Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKoq3BjCUamLCvz6ASW7R5ycuhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22144602/RTR_MKT_RobloxStil_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ryan’s World&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AyknTu"&gt;Ryan’s World has likewise been growing. The YouTube channel, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions"&gt;started with toy unboxing videos&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, has grown into a multimedia kids empire. The channel’s star, Ryan Kaji, has a TV show on Nick Jr., a racing video game available on major consoles, and a toy and clothing line sold at major retailers. The channel just made plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575169/youtube-ryan-world-amazon-show-animated-nickelodeon-ott-streaming"&gt;a new show on Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPGX7a"&gt;Kaji has been regularly playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; on one of his YouTube channels for more than two years, so offering a Ryan’s World level that viewers can later visit seems like a natural expansion. Though &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is free to play, it also offers creators a way to make money by selling items inside their game worlds. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/9-year-old-youtube-star-ryan-kaji-opens-virtual-world-on-roblox-11607079600"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Ryan’s World location will sell gems that can be exchanged for virtual goods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: what we learned about 2021 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verge 2021 Lede" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkj9OP847yaf5J3JYQ8RKmYfWmU=/1x0:5001x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455621/VRG_2021_v02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="StT2Mp"&gt;We’re at the point in 2020 when we’re hearing about everyone’s plans for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnmVdN"&gt;Here are a few things we learned this week about the upcoming year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lENpZI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bKUBIe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor will power the Android flagships of 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cq3JMT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai will step down on January 20th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="rn7cUL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has always been about the future, so our podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is well-prepared to discuss what’s on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aKqWqq"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9994688251&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VLL8Y1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reporter Julia Alexander joins &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn to discuss WarnerMedia’s decision to release all of its new 2021 movies — including Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;adaptation, the &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;sequel, &lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;, and others — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. Julia explains why this move is shaking up the movie industry and what this means for the future of cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DN8sV9"&gt;In the second half of the show, news editor Chaim Gartenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;explains the details behind Qualcomm’s newest processor&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapdragon 888, which will power some flagship Android phones in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xp0qeD"&gt;We’ve also got a few things to talk about regarding the Federal Communications Commission — including the next &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22048854/trump-nathan-simington-fcc-ajit-pai-section-230-moderation"&gt;potential FCC commissioner&lt;/a&gt; after Chairman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;Ajit Pai steps down early next year&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22037118/trump-section-230-repeal-ndaa-rider-facebook-twitter-moderation"&gt;another publicized threat to Section 230&lt;/a&gt; of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZSti6"&gt;It looks like &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has our work cut out for us next year, and &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; will be here to catch all of the news — but first, let’s listen to what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFM4lS"&gt;Other stories from this week:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGGw5PwDrzANZ-regrcl3nOYK_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19086558/akrales_190820_3597_0150.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Unlike the regular Switch, this model has a few standout features that make it one of the best-looking Switch models to date. It includes pastel green and blue Joy-Con, a white dock adorned with images of the Nook family, and the back of the Switch has an embossed design with little icons associated with the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XhVrAn"&gt;If you are looking for just the regular Nintendo Switch, you can get a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-joy-cons-system-with-mario-glassware-bundle%2FB204620X.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo Switch with neon joy-cons for $300 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This is different from the standard Switch purchase as it also includes some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; glassware at no additional cost. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUJLvUA3JhGEkMaXYRnoetEh8aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21940650/nintendo_switch_animal_crossing_new_horizons_edition.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out GameStop. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $84&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $46&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, you can get &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-with-Super-Mario-Odyssey-Full-Game-Download-Code%2F925436036&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one plus a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for $99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; though there is limited stock. If that sells out, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UL8Rr"&gt;Of course, there are also third-party options to choose from, especially if you liked the GameCube controller’s design. Amazon is currently running a deal that allows you to buy &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qu1XX6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three of PowerA’s wireless game controllers for $95&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great deal, especially if you plan to play multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos One Wi-Fi speakers are $40 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GKzkr0aVAS2gxRbUu2vdLWG4l0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455485/cwelch_171017_2068_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rw75jc"&gt;Sonos ran an all-too-short one-day sale on its Wi-Fi speakers last week for Black Friday. The good news is that they’re discounted once again at Best Buy and Amazon, though the price cuts aren’t as steep. Both the Sonos One SL without microphones and the Sonos One (Gen 2) are $40 off at either retailer. This puts the One SL at $140 and the One (Gen 2) at $160. Neither are best-ever prices, but given that they’re within $10 of their lowest costs, we thought you’d like to know about these deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFbttj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="c09uL9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTWctu"&gt;If HBO Max caught your attention yesterday with the news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all Warner Bros. films released through 2021 will debut day-and-date on the streaming platform&lt;/a&gt;, you understandably might want a subscription for yourself or to gift to someone else. For new and returning subscribers, you can save 20 percent by prepaying for a six-month subscription to the service. Instead of $90, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;it’ll cost you $70&lt;/a&gt;. Just note that this is non-refundable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ebjbmw2Vapdacy4wLrBoBLYrO9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072255/cod_black_ops_cold_war_2.png"&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCall-of-Duty-Black-Ops-Cold-War-Activision-PlayStation-4%2F248299136&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCall-of-Duty-Black-Ops-Cold-War-Activision-Xbox-One%2F501702889&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; version of the game now costs $50 instead of $60. If you’re already gaming on the PS5 or Xbox Series X / S consoles, you’ll spend $60 (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCall-of-Duty-Black-Ops-Cold-War-Activision-PlayStation-5%2F176630812&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCall-of-Duty-Black-Ops-Cold-War-Activision-Xbox-Series-X%2F727753868&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;) instead of $70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5jVRd"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that if you get the PS4 / Xbox One version, there’s a $10 fee associated with getting the next-gen patch for either the PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. So if you just don’t want to fuss with that, get the pricier next-gen version instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to the new Verge Deals newsletter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiArMl4cJ98Hh7gEpBIB6Wca_XE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455407/Verge_Deals_Hero_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gJWi5w"&gt;Every day we scour the internet looking for the best deals and sales on the products that we’ve tested and confirmed. We share those deals with you through our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; coverage in both daily and weekly roundups. Now you can get those same deals and sales in your inbox every week through our new &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaPSmZ"&gt;Subscribers will receive a Friday dispatch containing a handful of the best deals from that week. Like our coverage on the site, we aren’t focused on minuscule price drops on random tech products. Each newsletter will contain the best current prices on tech we’ve used and enjoyed, or that we at least feel comfortable recommending. And occasionally, we’ll include deals that are exclusive to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPhFxo"&gt;If you want to subscribe to get &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-approved deals in your inbox, sign up in the box below. For now, we’re keeping this to a weekly cadence (with the occasional break for holidays), but if we expand on it and decide to do it more frequently, we’ll be sure to let you know. And of course, should you choose to no longer want to receive the newsletter, unsubscribing will be as easy as signing up. Because deals can sometimes change after we send the newsletter, its contents will be posted to the site on Saturday mornings reflecting any necessary updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ST1NNZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="92ACWr"&gt;Stay tuned for our first newsletter coming later this afternoon and if you’re also interested in more frequent emails with the latest tech news and commentary, be sure to sign up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046395/processor-newsletter-tech-computers-gadgets-software-dieter-bohn-consumer"&gt;Dieter Bohn’s &lt;em&gt;Processor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which goes out a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian is a video game hero, and the new episode finally turns up the difficulty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJMTIkvHvrSu1aTWgHPr65DzDrk=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68455313/HUC2_FF_003159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mHAdse"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/11/25/20978320/the-mandalorian-video-game-comparison-disney-plus-fetch-quest-armor-upgrade"&gt;It’s often been commented&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is designed a lot like a video game. The Mandalorian himself feels like a player character, running around a galaxy full of people who are always in need of something, doing different side-quests for NPCs in exchange for help or a new piece of gear. (That’s part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;what makes him such a great fit in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QwD1k"&gt;But in season 2, episode 6, “The Tragedy,” those comparisons are even more pronounced with the reintroduction of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; characters that first appeared &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; high-level video game enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jtPJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian, season 2 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and the 1995 PC game &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star War: Dark Forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNeJNs"&gt;Dark Troopers are back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEG0uv"&gt;Originally introduced in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Dark Forces&lt;/em&gt;, the Dark Troopers were meant to be a possible successor to Stormtroopers, with nearly indestructible armor that was proof to lightsabers. (Interestingly, the armor is not made of Beskar, but rather “Phrik.” There is a surprisingly large number of nearly indestructible rare metals in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.) And instead of fallible human warriors, the Dark Troopers were battle droids that (at least in theory) would be more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zyuGZ"&gt;The genesis of the Dark Troopers, though, is a more practical one. &lt;em&gt;Dark Forces&lt;/em&gt; was the first attempt from LucasArts to make a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; first-person shooter, one that drew heavily on the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; but added more exploration and objective-based gameplay than the classic shooter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RkBbrHvzPg1spn3E9UvQubM-2TU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22144480/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_9.12.10_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Dark Trooper, as seen in Dark Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nbeMP3"&gt;And while the “canon” explanation for the Dark Troopers was as a bigger, badder Stormtrooper replacement, the real-world explanation is even simpler. As a video game — one specifically built to emulate the original &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Dark Forces&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t have been very fun to play if the entire game was simply mowing down wave after wave of the run-of-the-mill Stormtroopers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yAT2s1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More powerful, challenging enemies were needed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4fttz5"&gt;More powerful, challenging enemies were needed: hence, the various models of Dark Troopers, who were harder to fight and wielded far more powerful weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59QZL6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Forces&lt;/em&gt; was excised from the “official” &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; canon when Disney bought the franchise and reset the universe; their inclusion in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; marks their first on-screen reintroduction in the new Disney timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUuLBp"&gt;And while the return of old Legends elements into the current continuity isn’t a new thing, what’s particularly notable is that the Dark Troopers are once again taking the similar role for our live-action video game analogue. After spending multiple episodes (think of them as individual levels) watching Mando power right through legions of bog-standard Stormtroopers, it’s no wonder that a more powerful foe would be needed to stop him. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvC08XGN0pygiDZOkdJsc7XCZgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22144462/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_9.01.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Flpe3O"&gt;“The Tragedy” makes that clear: between Mando, the returning sharpshooter Fennec Shand, and the re-armored Boba Fett, there’s virtually nothing that two whole platoons of Stormtroopers could do to stop him. Because for all the hype over the might of the Empire’s legions, in practice, Stormtroopers are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad at their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcPUoy"&gt;The Dark Troopers are the logical solution — of course the Empire would have been exploring new options to replace the objectively not very useful Stormtroopers. And if they’re anything like their original video game counterparts, it’s likely that Mando (and his friends) will have a pretty tough fight ahead of them to save Grogu (née Baby Yoda) in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="juwL1F"&gt;After all: what’s a video game without a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/12/27/21038233/the-mandalorian-darksaber-black-lightsaber-bo-katan-moff-gideon"&gt;boss battle&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Becca Farsace tests and reviews wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeAjum7pb4pBu-0t9Wf5xayeFnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68454979/bfarsace_201130_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wireless Earbuds come in many shapes, sizes, and at many different price points. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfygW5"&gt;Wireless earbud reviews don’t just happen. Three weeks ago, I got my hands on seven pairs of wireless earbuds to see which is the best option under $100. This might sound like Christmas Day for many, but the sight of such a pile on my desk for me spells ear pain and the inevitable feeling of needing to find new music to love or podcasts to be fascinated by. Don’t get me wrong, I love my job but what no one told me about reviewing tech is it takes time and dedication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QarqVo"&gt;When researching what earbuds I wanted to test, I started with reputable companies with established customer service operations. I also sent many Slack messages to my co-worker Chris Welch who also reviews wireless headphones for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Then, the earbuds started flowing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnVlmP"&gt;I always start my earbud testing the same: wear each model for at least one battery cycle to get a sense of pairing, controls, battery life, and comfort. A good wireless earbud has to check four boxes for me: good sound quality, solid Bluetooth connection, comfortable fit without being too large, and enough battery life for at least four hours of continuous listening. Oh! And a good mic is a big plus, but I also realize that not everyone talks on the phone as much as I do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fYaK1sJZSSUZMZnHsvTS6eKtvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141596/adiaconis_201202_4322_0001.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds Z are light and comfortable even during long listening sessions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touch controls are important for folks who don’t want to take out their phones to control their experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skullcandy Indy Evos have a really snug fit that will feel secure for first-time wireless earbud users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq7sAM"&gt;For this video I tested Skullcandy’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Sesh-True-Wireless-Earbud/dp/B0857JLRFJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$59.99 Sesh Evo&lt;/a&gt;, Skullcandy’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Indy-True-Wireless-Earbud/dp/B084SC59D7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99 Indy Evo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-buds-z#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.1more.com%2Fproducts%2Fpistonbuds-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$49.99 1More PistonBuds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-215TWS-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08L9QWQ1Z/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=JBL+Tune+215TWS&amp;amp;qid=1607006280&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$69.99 JBL Tune 215TWS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Charging-Resistance-Connection/dp/B086PB4J44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$30 JLab Go Air&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725525814770003251" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99 JLab Epic Air ANC&lt;/a&gt; earbuds. Those are the regular retail prices for each model, but these frequently go on sale and it’s not hard to find any one of them for even less than their sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38usrG"&gt;In the first round of testing, I made three eliminations. First, Skullcandy’s Sesh Evos for their very large-sized buds that never stayed in my ears and their very plastic, cheap-feeling case. Next, the 1More PistonBuds were eliminated for needing to pull the right bud out of the case first so that it would connect to the left bud, which would then connect to my phone — a tediously clumsy process. If I didn’t pull the PistonBuds out in that order, the left bud would connect to my phone before connecting to the right bud and then only play media out of the left bud. And lastly, the JLab Go Airs were cut because of their open case design which, although it has magnets to keep the earbuds seated, resulted in them coming out of their case in my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesxxm"&gt;With four pairs left, it was time for round two: natural selection. At this price point, the difference in each model is fit, build quality, and connection. I keep all of the headphones that are still in play in a pile on my desk and every morning I see what I naturally gravitate toward the most and when. Very quickly, I was able to determine my favorite pair. Although they lack a lot of the touch controls I like on other models, I kept going back to the $49.99 OnePlus Buds Z.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus Buds Z deliver a full sound in a small, affordable package." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPhEbpBGp3SbOTFb5E-5_HHjuaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053533/oneplus.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds Z, pictured on a shelf, are great budget wireless earbuds that cost only $50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vklG88"&gt;The OnePlus Buds Z’s 10mm drivers deliver a full sound with decent separation of highs and lows, but above all else, they have a kicking bass. There is IP55 water resistance and the silicone ear tips block out enough loud noise to be able to hear music clearly, even on the subway. I take each of my top picks on a few subway rides to test how much sound is being blocked and how strong of a Bluetooth connection they have. On my nightly walk around Brooklyn it never felt like a hassle to bring the Bud Z’s small, light case and I found I could comfortably wear the buds for long listening sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu3Y7C"&gt;Typically, at the point in my testing where I have chosen a winner, I would have my friends over for a cookout and spring earbud testing upon them. Right after dinner, I would grab my top picks and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and we would go around testing each pair. This time, I had to rely on more Slacks to Chris Welch and just one trusty friend. But even with a smaller pool, the choice was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8PKf4"&gt;From the balanced sound quality with decent bass, a mic I could use on Zoom calls, and a comfortable fit, the Buds Z feel more premium than the other earbuds in this price range. They also have a case that doesn’t feel plasticky, although it lacks wireless charging, one of my favorite features. At this price, though, there’s really little to complain about. Check out the video for more information on the OnePlus Buds Z and to see what I choose as my second and third choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYtHVw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6WJOY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the lieutenant governor pushing Democrats to get serious about weed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvGQYBTSK2KzG2b8D9YKzp7asPo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68454986/VRG_ILLO_4317_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman thinks legalization is the biggest popular issue no one wants to take on&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dYe6y7"&gt;In the wake of the 2020 election, Democrats are looking for answers — and if you ask John Fetterman, the answer is marijuana. Pennsylvania’s unorthodox Lieutenant Governor has established himself as a kind of unofficial spokesman for the state’s efforts to legalize the drug, both in his public statements and on his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. And while the issue makes many politicians nervous, Fetterman is insistent that it’s far more popular than they realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuepxS"&gt;“America wants this and is ready for this and has been ready for it,” Fetterman said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And no matter what it is that does it for you, whether it’s revenue, justice, jobs, freedom, farmers, veterans, there are so many reasons to support it. The only reason against it is this vestigial reefer madness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxOe8b"&gt;Fetterman is exasperated that neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to have the political will to make it happen, despite a recent groundswell of voter support. He and Governor Tom Wolf have repeatedly tried to push for state legislation in recent months, as it became clear neighboring New Jersey would soon pass a decriminalization bill of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSldFR"&gt;“We either do it now and take advantage of what we can do in Pennsylvania, or we’re going to lose a lot of revenue to our neighboring states,” Wolf said during an October press conference. Tax revenue from cannabis, Wolf argues, could prove invaluable for revitalizing Pennsylvania’s pandemic-ravaged economy. Leaders of the Republican-controlled state legislature however, have called legalizing &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/12/pa-senate-gop-leader-opposes-recreational-marijuana.html"&gt;recreational pot “reckless and irresponsible.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2Y5F"&gt;Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana in 2016 and opened its first dispensaries in 2018, but the drug is still illegal without a doctor’s approval. But as legalization gains ground across the country, there’s increasing pressure on states like Pennsylvania. As of this writing, medical marijuana is legal in 35 states; recreational weed is legal in 15 states and the District of Columbia, despite remaining illegal at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="spFQ0g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the unambiguous winner in November of 2020 was weed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJWPXu"&gt;When he ran in the Senate primary in 2016, Fetterman says he was the only candidate nationally calling for legalization, a cause he has pushed in some form or other ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaX05K"&gt;“I don’t shrink away or call it ‘unfortunate’ or something,” he says of his party’s position on cannabis. “Thank goodness that Trump wasn’t savvy enough to say, ‘you know, what? legal weed!’ They can argue about what happened in the election in 2020. But the unambiguous winner in November of 2020 was weed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uph67Z"&gt;Indeed, in every state where marijuana legalization was on the ballot this year, people voted in favor. Arizona, Montana, and New Jersey voted to approve recreational cannabis sales to people 21 and over, while Mississippi voted to approved medical marijuana use. And perhaps even more significantly, the measures in Arizona and Montana both called for past marijuana-related crimes to be expunged from people’s records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CckFX0"&gt;Had President Trump prioritized legalization, Fetterman adds, he thinks the 2020 election would have turned out much worse for Democrats. “I think if Trump would have legalized weed and would have made a push for for pardons, and totally upended it and removed prohibition, I think he would have actually won quite handily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOve8g"&gt;Legalizing marijuana is not a new subject for Fetterman, who says he uses over-the-counter, THC-free CBD gummies and ointments for aches and pains and general well-being but does not smoke marijuana himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dww9i0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am honestly incensed that this was kept from me for my entire life because of reefer madness.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H9CKe1"&gt;“I am honestly incensed that this was kept from me for my entire life because of reefer madness,” he says. “And I find my outrage directed at the medical community too, that had no qualms about unleashing the Kraken on the American people with Oxycontin and opioids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXiAvP"&gt;Before he was elected lieutenant governor, Fetterman, who holds a master’s in public policy from Harvard and is known for his trademark wardrobe of a gray work shirt and cargo shorts, spent 13 years as the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania. The job paid $150 a year in a community where 35 percent of people live below the poverty line. He and his wife, Gisele, still live in Braddock with their three kids, and even though he holds statewide office now, Fetterman carries reminders of the borough on his skin. He has Braddock’s zip code tattooed on his left arm, and his right arm has the dates of nine of the ten homicides that occurred in Braddock during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0YXLt"&gt;In the summer of 2019, Fetterman went on a listening tour across the commonwealth, visiting all 67 counties to find out whether there was in fact widespread support for legalizing recreational weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdkwFc"&gt;“It was an earnest, goodwill, full on conversation, and by far the most interactive discussion of a public policy topic in Pennsylvania’s history, without a doubt,” he says. “And you know, I’m smart enough to know how to read an electoral map and I could have picked which counties I wanted. But I wanted to hear from everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88jBjy"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190925_Pennsylvania_Report_on_Adult_Use_Recreational_Marijuana-.pdf"&gt;report complied from Fetterman’s listening tour&lt;/a&gt;, 65 to 70 percent of Pennsylvanians said they approved of adult-use cannabis legalization. “And that’s what’s so crazy about it, is that there are so many what we call mainline Republicans in Pennsylvania that would love to just sit in their backyard by their fire pit after a long day and just take the edge off with a vape pen of weed,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4GEtX"&gt;And, he notes, Pennsylvania already has a thriving weed market, albeit an illegal one. “It’s a shit show, and it creates all kinds of externalities that people, especially people of color, are ground up by. And that needs to change,” he says. “We need to figure out a mechanism that balances the freedom and the distribution of it with the acknowledgement that it needs to generate revenue that can be used for the greater good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="evZmSR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration would leave it up to states to decide on legalizing recreational weed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CO3J7Y"&gt;Some of that enthusiasm has trickled up to the national level. &lt;a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/"&gt;The official 2020 Democratic Party platform&lt;/a&gt; calls for decriminalizing marijuana use via executive action and supports legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, but it leaves it up to states to decide whether to legalize weed for recreational use. During the campaign, President-elect &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/justice/#"&gt;Joe Biden called for&lt;/a&gt; decriminalizing cannabis use, expunging prior convictions, and taking cannabis off the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6842187/drug-schedule-list-marijuana"&gt;schedule 1 drug list&lt;/a&gt; — which includes heroin and LSD — to allow research. But Biden would leave decisions about whether to legalize recreational marijuana up to states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSqa7r"&gt;Previous decriminalization bills have stalled out in Congress, with the Democratic-led House putting forth legislation only to see it die in the Senate. The House tried again to include banking reform for marijuana companies in a second coronavirus relief package in August, but the Trump administration and Senate Republicans balked. Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/cannabis-appears-more-job-democrats-new-stimulus-bill-1504393"&gt;Mitch McConnell scoffed that the bill&lt;/a&gt; “mentions the word cannabis 68 times, more than the words jobs or hire are mentioned in the entire bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmYWQi"&gt;The House is&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/house-gets-ready-for-historic-vote-on-federal-marijuana-prohibition-192829701.html"&gt; expected to vote this week&lt;/a&gt; on a bill that would remove marijuana from the controlled substances list. The MORE Act, introduced by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), would effectively eliminate marijuana prohibition and require that federal courts expunge prior marijuana arrests from people’s criminal records. But getting the bill through Congress would require buy-in from Senate Republicans, who are unlikely to play ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xz17jz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“weed helped a lot of people get through this pandemic.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BWBsx"&gt;Given the gridlock at the federal level, Fetterman worries that national Democrats will leave drug policy on the back burner. “I think they’re going to say ‘we have other priorities,’” Fetterman says. “And I’m thinking, ‘no, no you don’t,’ because weed helped a lot of people get through this pandemic. And it would help a lot of other people dial back their addictions to other things like opioids and alcohol and other things. It’s really the perfect time for it. And all it involves is saying ‘yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4m3C9"&gt;Fetterman believes that Illinois — which opened its first dispensaries for recreational use in January — is a model for Pennsylvania to pursue full legalization. Sales of marijuana in Illinois are likely to &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/cannabis/2020/12/2/22146660/illinois-weed-sales-could-top-1-billion-in-2020-expert-says"&gt;surpass $1 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, state officials say. Fetterman winces at what he sees as revenue left on the table in Pennsylvania; according to the auditor general, legal weed could bring &lt;a href="https://www.paauditor.gov/press-releases/auditor-general-depasquale-says-state-could-reap-581-million-annually-by-regulating-taxing-marijuana"&gt;$581 million a year into Pennsylvania’s coffers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="perZ8A"&gt;“I’m a realist, and it’s not like I can sit at a desk and craft [legislation] myself, this is going to have to involve by definition, the GOP,” Fetterman says. “And right now this is a party with its head in the sand trying to deny this even though they know we’re right about it. I don’t want the perfect to become the enemy of the good. But we’re not going to be able to get to where Illinois is anytime soon unless there’s a sea change in the Pennsylvania GOP mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIEPva"&gt;Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, however, are currently preoccupied with the state of the presidential election and Trump’s attempts to overturn his loss. Fetterman has been a reliably vocal critic, mocking the president and the GOP on his Twitter account and in interviews. “The echo chamber on the other side is so desperate to find something to excite and mollify the snake handlers in the party,” he says. “And they know, there isn’t one person in leadership that honestly believes any of it. It’s all just carnival barking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSuNzl"&gt;Still, Fetterman thinks both parties share some of the blame for failing to legalize cannabis, and he is particularly incensed that the segments of the party responsible for putting Biden in the White House continue to bear the brunt of the effects of drug laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DCBPe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the Democratic Party is to the right of South Dakota on legal weed, and it’s like, ‘what the hell is wrong with you?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNG01m"&gt;“I find the Democrats’ platform on it cowardly, and, on the wrong side of history,” he said. “So the Democratic Party is to the right of South Dakota on legal weed, and it’s like, ‘what the hell is wrong with you?’” Fetterman says. “The Democratic Party owes its electoral success in this election to Black and brown communities. And they are disgustingly, disproportionately impacted by weed prohibition more than anybody.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivso0S"&gt;Although he hasn’t committed to any specific race, observers think &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/toomey-exit-kick-starts-2022-guesswork-among-pa-politicos/"&gt;Fetterman is likely to run for Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA)’s Senate seat&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. (Toomey has said he won’t seek reelection.) That would put him in a much stronger position to advocate for permanent change to marijuana laws at the national level. But for now, he sees the issue of legalizing weed as an urgent matter for the Keystone State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="djv6NO"&gt;“Forty percent of our state is going to live a grocery store away from a Candyland of legal weed” in New Jersey, Fetterman said. “It’s inevitable. So you can either be rolled over by it or you can be a frontrunner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbixK7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lye5f6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Return to Bird World is the real soundtrack to a fake sequel to a video game that doesn’t exist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Return to Bird World album cover art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hvOtI_Cr8QTI8aGvNKtW32TM-w=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68454844/Return_to_Bird_World_Cover___The_Verge.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Aliana Wong / Leon Chang&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlPYW8"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, players are brought back to the floating kingdom of Bird World thousands of years after the events of the original game to find the once-brilliant island has fallen into ruin. While the darker setting is a departure from &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/bird-world"&gt;the original &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new game still has one key trait in common: it doesn’t actually exist. But its soundtrack does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrfHqM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World &lt;/em&gt;comes from musician and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/585859882869469184"&gt;Twitter personality&lt;/a&gt; Leon Chang, who’s been releasing video game-inspired albums for the past few years. His first big project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15479308/leyawn-twitter-bird-world-album-video-game-soundtrack"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was ostensibly the soundtrack to an SNES-era game about a tiny bird embarking on an adventure. Even though you’ll never play it, the soundtrack offered an idea of what the nonexistent game might be about. You’d journey across a playful island, help out residents of a small village, and ultimately face a world-changing battle before saying goodbye to all the quirky characters you met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5i9f2"&gt;Chang said the idea for making a fake soundtrack came out of the music to which he was already writing and listening. “I like to write music that sounds like it comes from a video game, so why not make an album that’s based around a fake video game?” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="urddwS"&gt;&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2542532920/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;return to bird world by leon chang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFQK6M"&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Bird World &lt;/em&gt;has jumped to a new generation. The album has PlayStation-esque artwork and a sprawling length — an hour and a half — to match the expansive soundtracks that’d score games like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also more varied and less relentlessly cheery than the original. “The Mushroom God” seems to depict a melancholy deity whose land has fallen to ruin; “Sesame City” is fit for a bustling town with a futuristic edge; and “A World Descends Into Chaos” pretty much sounds like the name implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OaXdx"&gt;Chang said he started planning a &lt;em&gt;Bird World &lt;/em&gt;sequel almost as soon as the original came out (he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/933806013349842945"&gt;teased a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; as far back as November 2017). Feedback on the original was good enough to warrant the sequel, he said, but there was also plenty more he wanted to do. While writing the first album, Chang found that he had ideas for more songs that, as an amateur musician, he was still figuring out how to actually create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZMNnF"&gt;“On &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;, I wish I could have done more orchestral stuff and more soundtrack-y type of stuff, and now I have the ability to do that,” Chang said. “This next album just feels like taking all of that into as big of a thing as I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4QqIy"&gt;The album came together with the help of a “long-running Google Doc” where Chang sketched out the plot, characters, and settings of &lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World&lt;/em&gt;. While you won’t get to read the whole thing, you can get some of the details from a 28-page game manual that accompanies the physical release of the album — a double CD package that’s likewise meant to emulate those classic PlayStation RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KOHnf9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;game manual teaser:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;table of contents~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tracklist details~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mastered by me&lt;br&gt;mixed by me&lt;br&gt;engineered by me&lt;br&gt;recorded at my house&lt;br&gt;saxophone on "a world descends into chaos" by steve pardo &lt;a href="https://t.co/yz3Mdd85jp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yz3Mdd85jp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— leon (@leyawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/1330240053956792320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rthjqP"&gt;Listeners won’t know the whole story by the time they’re finished, but Chang designed the album so that there’s a narrative running from beginning to end. “I’m hoping people can get some of [the plot] out of the tracks,” he said, “but a lot is left to the imagination still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqO2Tr"&gt;Some tracks were created specifically to score locations or events Chang had in mind, while others started as songs that he later worked into the plot. Chang hired artists to create the album’s cover and the game manual illustrations (Aliana Wong and Titas Antanas Vilkaitis), and he wrote the copy himself. “I put all the copy and design together, and that took me forever to do,” Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1czxup"&gt;The result is another album that ought to leave you wishing you could play the game to which it belongs. The album &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;comes out today on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; and will be available on other streaming platforms starting Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
