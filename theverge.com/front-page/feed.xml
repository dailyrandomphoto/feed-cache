    <title>Rocket Lab unveils details of new reusable Neutron launcher</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPyIhX"&gt;This morning, small satellite launcher Rocket Lab unveiled the details of its future, more powerful Neutron rocket — a launch vehicle optimized to carry satellites into orbit for future mega-constellations. Made out of a special carbon composite that Rocket Lab created, Neutron will also be mostly reusable, designed to land on a landing pad after launch — similar to how SpaceX lands its Falcon 9 rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5udAj6"&gt;“This is not a conventional rocket,” Peter Beck, Rocket Lab’s CEO, said during the unveil, livestreamed on YouTube. “This is what a rocket should look like in 2050. But we’re building it today.” As of now, Neutron is slated for its first flight in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRWFlk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not a conventional rocket.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLOTve"&gt;Rocket Lab already has one rocket called Electron, which the company has been launching to orbit since 2017. Electron is meant to carry relatively small satellites into low Earth orbit, to capitalize on the small satellite revolution. But in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;Rocket Lab announced its intention to build another bigger rocket called Neutron&lt;/a&gt;, along with plans to go public via a SPAC merger. It was a big change for the company, since Beck once vowed he’d “eat his hat” if he ever made a reusable rocket or a larger rocket. During the March announcement, he did, indeed, eat an actual hat from a blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGLWHN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0thW57QeDM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJC4hG"&gt;Neutron will stand at 131 feet (or 40 meters) tall, towering much higher than Electron which is just 59 feet (18 meters) tall. Propelled by seven new main engines called Archimedes, the rocket will be capable of putting between eight and 15 tons into low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab claims the vehicle will be perfect for launching medium-sized satellites that are part of proposed mega-constellations, massive satellite initiatives aimed at providing broadband coverage to the Earth below. However, Beck envisions other opportunities for Neutron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWtWDk"&gt;“It’s great for geostationary deployments, human spaceflight, and of course, my personal favorite, interplanetary,” Beck said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gUwVhu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s great for geostationary deployments, human spaceflight, and of course, my personal favorite, interplanetary.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="swTvbB"&gt;Perhaps the most notable thing about the Neutron design is that it will be reusable, meaning practically every single part of the rocket will be returned to Earth after launch. It also bucks modern convention of how most orbital rockets work nowadays. Typically, rockets are launched in “stages” or parts that are stacked on top of each other. During launch, as a rocket rapidly gobbles up its propellant, the first stage of the rocket — or most of the rocket’s body — will eventually break away and fall back to Earth. Depleted of fuel, the stage becomes needless weight. As the rocket body falls away, the upper portion of the rocket — or the second stage — will ignite its engine (or engines) and propel the payload farther into space and deploy it into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAc3IV"&gt;Neutron will be a little different. Rather than stack the stages on top of each other, Rocket Lab plans to put the second stage &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the first one. The second stage, propelled by one Archimedes engine, will be attached to the payload and stay housed inside of the full body of the rocket, completely protected during launch. Once in space, the top of the rocket will open up, releasing the second stage / payload combo. The two then continue their journey into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vR9wG2CBsB97Sq8FQAaZ36Wbt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057857/Neutron_Hungry_Hippo_Fairing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation of Neutron’s “Hungry Hippo” fairing design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbecEv"&gt;And that’s where things get weird. For most typical rockets these days, the main payload or satellite being launched is encased inside of a nosecone, or fairing, during flight. The bulbous structure on top of the rocket protects the payload during the climb through Earth’s atmosphere. Once in space, the fairing then breaks apart and falls back to Earth, where it’s usually lost. That won’t be the case with Neutron. Instead, the fairing will &lt;em&gt;hinge&lt;/em&gt; open, allowing the payload to deploy into space while keeping the fairing attached to the rocket. That way, the fairings never leave the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zva0Cv"&gt;“The answer is not throwing away the fairings or even trying to catch them,” Beck says. “The best way is never get rid of them in the first place.” Rocket Lab refers to the fairings as the “Hungry Hippo” fairing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0g8Vl"&gt;Once the second stage and payload are on their way, the main body of Neutron — with fairings in tow — will return to Earth and land upright on a landing pad. An animation of the process is very reminiscent of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket landing on a launch pad after takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjhiD3a2eASrg0QMucGj7rDfNjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057864/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_8.31.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beck with the battering ram and stainless steel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eb4fIa"&gt;During the presentation, there were plenty of subtle digs at SpaceX. For one, Rocket Lab does not plan to land Neutron on ships in the ocean, like SpaceX does. Plus, the fairing design seems to be in direct response to SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039860/spacex-falcon-9-payload-fairing-mr-steven-net-catch"&gt;which tried for years to catch the fairings of its rocket&lt;/a&gt; using big nets attached to boats. While the company was successful in catching the fairings a handful of times, ultimately SpaceX abandoned the initiative due to poor reliability. Instead, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1379744947453054981?s=20"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in April&lt;/a&gt; that SpaceX would retrieve the fairings out of the water and refurbish them for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMrH5n"&gt;Another nod to SpaceX came when Beck discussed the material from which Neutron would be made. Beck knocked stainless steel, the main material SpaceX is using to build its new Starship rocket. To further his point, he used a battering ram to hit a sheet of stainless steel, showing how it bends. Instead, Neutron will be made out of a special carbon composite material created by Rocket Lab, which the company insinuated is sturdier. (The battering ram, of course, didn’t bend that one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs8Pzy"&gt;However, one thing that Rocket Lab can’t quite claim is that Neutron is &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; reusable. Just like with the Falcon 9 rocket, the second stage will not return to Earth once its puts the payload into orbit. But if it works, it will be a unique type of vehicle that’s not on the market yet. Rocket Lab says it’s already working on prototypes and that the Archimedes engine will do its first test ignition sometime next year. Until then, Neutron may look cool, but it’s still just an animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbvWnF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the metaverse is more than Mark Zuckerberg’s dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A stylized image of Mark Zuckerberg staring at a Meta logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jTXoRSXHzP1CbuLTvNvTpBCOy0=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219269/VRG_VRP_Metaverse_Thumbnail_textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjC5Ci"&gt;The company formerly known as Facebook has bet big on the metaverse. CEO Mark Zuckerberg hyped the already popular term in October, when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;changed the company’s name to Meta&lt;/a&gt; and led viewers through its dizzying vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8q2j5g"&gt;But “the metaverse” is a much bigger — and more confusing — idea. From its origins in science fiction, it’s become a catchall for anything that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;mixes people’s physical and virtual lives&lt;/a&gt;. That includes virtual and augmented reality headsets; 3D virtual worlds like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;; and decentralized Web3 services including cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens or NFTs. Lots of “metaverse” proponents don’t agree on a single definition for the word &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; on how much people are already living in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex778f"&gt;While Meta is making big investments, other companies have already built metaverse-style platforms — some, like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; developer Linden Lab, years before Facebook even existed. Here, we delve into the ambiguities of 2021’s most omnipresent tech buzzword and why it might not look like &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these companies have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The quest to make an AI that can play competitive Pokémon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7jo5dj4YmRkbiV1tE-VJg0oibE=/106x0:5749x3762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219243/Switch_PokemonSwordPokemonShield_artwork_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;AI wanna be the very best, like no one ever was&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7OSqWX"&gt;An AI can beat a chess grandmaster. An AI can become the &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; esports champion. But creating an AI that could play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;at the competitive level has been a more elusive problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cggh9D"&gt;Thanks to the variety of monsters, stats, moves, and items, a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;battle has hundreds of thousands of factors for any player — or machine — to consider. But that hasn’t stopped some people from trying. Most recently, Future Sight AI, created by computer scientist Albert III, successfully made it into the top 5 percent of the competitive ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV9DTg"&gt;Albert posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvj7CmTRkg&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheThirdBuild"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; explaining how it all works, but to summarize, the bot takes in all the information it can about the current state of the game, extrapolates the possibilities for all the turns it could take, looks a couple of turns ahead to how these would play out, and then chooses the option that can lead to the highest number of best outcomes. By doing all of that within 15 seconds, turn after turn, it can beat all but the very best human players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ly0bE"&gt;That’s pretty impressive, especially when you consider that Albert had almost no experience with artificial intelligence or other major aspects of the program before he started working on it. “I took classes in college about machine learning, [but] the real question is: was I paying attention?” he laughs. “The main software that it runs on is called Node.js. I hadn’t touched that at all before I started this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="hXTj3C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhvj7CmTRkg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BCAhYS"&gt;“Even though computer science is my day job, it’s something that I love so much that I can’t help but do it in my free time, too,” he says. That passion, combined with pandemic boredom, propelled him to look into an idea that was first inspired by his interest in basketball. “[Some websites] would do this thing where you’d be able to watch a game and see the team’s current chance of winning, and I thought about doing that for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “Then just kind of one thing led to another and then I ended up with an AI on my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="46WHZu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One thing led to another and then I ended up with an AI on my hands.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYV6oQ"&gt;One thing leading to another is a pretty good summary of Albert’s work on Future Sight AI. He says he wanted to learn new skills and simply broke them down into small enough tasks until he was able to create his vision. “This is such a bad reference but there’s that song in &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2&lt;/em&gt;, called ‘&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6g1yQV0dIY"&gt;The Next Right [Thing]&lt;/a&gt;.’ It’s just that. Just keep doing that until you get somewhere,” he says. Nowadays, for example, he knows Node.js so well that he can use it in projects at his day job, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh58uX"&gt;His step-by-step approach means that he actually wasn’t aware of previous attempts to make similar AIs. Earlier projects are not as well documented as Albert’s, though there have been a few varying success levels that gained some attention within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7p4l0"&gt;An early example was &lt;a href="http://doublewise.net/pokemon/"&gt;Technical Machine&lt;/a&gt;, first created in 2010. Though it was updated through 2019, Technical Machine only ever fully supported &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;up to Generation 4 and did not create its own teams, one of the key features of Future Sight. Additionally, at the time of its release, the competitive ladder base was not established in the same way, so it’s difficult to tell how successful Technical Machine was overall. One Reddit comment, however, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/e8kwqj/want_to_create_a_showdown_ai_some_basic_questions/"&gt;stated that&lt;/a&gt; “Technical Machine at its smartest was still leagues worse than a normal player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnglzQ"&gt;Another example &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/3i4hww/pokemon_showdown_ai/"&gt;was posted on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 by a user who went by onmabd. Comments indicated that it was “one of the stronger bots to date.” The competitive ladder gives players a ranking of 1,000 to begin with, which then goes up or down depending on wins and losses. There’s no public way to view the data, and it changes over time, so it’s tricky to evaluate what a “good” rank is. However, during his creation process, Albert found that the average player’s ranking settles at around 1,170. Onmabd’s AI managed to reach 1,300, which would put it in the top 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pokemon European International Championships" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjVC2vFHtphSDFBcn18648xMoyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055386/875279370.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RneLoK"&gt;More recently, a user on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; community forum Smogon going by pmariglia shared &lt;a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/yet-another-pokemon-showdown-battle-bot.3648979/"&gt;another attempt&lt;/a&gt;. Their AI beat Technical Machine in a best of three and was able to reach a rating of between 1,250 and 1,350 — again, around the top 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq5ii5"&gt;Future Sight AI ranked at 1,550 on average during testing. Though Albert &lt;a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/future-sight-ai.3668916/"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; on Smogon “for making it seem in my video that [Future Sight] is the first bot of its kind or the first to get as far as it did,” (as well as detailing where the two projects take different approaches) he says that ultimately he’s glad he didn’t know that other people had already attempted his project. “I don’t know why I never thought to look into it [but] if I’d gone down their path I might have ended up with the same results,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtossU"&gt;He also was never expecting the video to gain as much attention as it did. For starters, when I ask about its creation, he laughs. “I have to reveal something,” he says. “That entire video was animated in Powerpoint. I have to say I don’t have much video production experience [so] I had an idea for what I wanted the video to look like and I just kind of kept working on it until I could get the tools that I knew how to use to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkxWVu"&gt;Then, there was the delayed reaction. Posted in July, it was only viewed about 100 times in its first three weeks. The next week, it jumped up to 300,000. (As of late November, it’s almost at 600,000 views.) Albert thinks that it was picked up by somebody in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; community who posted it to Twitter, causing it to blow up, but he never found out who.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FfsUg4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The whole point of what I’m doing is that I want to teach people about computer science.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHzoFL"&gt;He says that it was difficult to process the sudden influx of viewers, but that he was appreciative of how supportive the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;community was. “I kind of just had to take a step back a bit because the whole point of what I’m doing is that I want to teach people about computer science,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lK1Zgi"&gt;In particular, as a Black man, Albert wants to be the kind of representation he never had in the field. “I figured I have experience in public speaking, I like doing projects that people might find interesting, so really I wanted to put out a channel that said, ‘This can be an example of someone like you doing fun things in computer science.’ That’s genuinely the core of why I’m doing all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGqFwM"&gt;For now, his focus is on getting Future Sight playable in actual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;games. Thus far, it has used Pokémon Showdown, a community-created simulator that allows online battling and functionally forms the center of the competitive scene. But early on Albert was hinting that he wanted to make something that could tie in with the releases of &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl. &lt;/em&gt;Most recently, he’s managed to get it to beat the final boss of &lt;em&gt;Sword and Shield&lt;/em&gt;, despite not having any code to deal with Dynamaxing, which is banned in common competitive settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZacrK0"&gt;Beyond that, he doesn’t have too many concrete goals. “I mean this is such a corny thing, but I want it to be the very best like no one ever was,” he says, echoing the old &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; anime theme tune. “But seriously, I don’t know. I just started this for fun and I want to take it as far as I still find joy out of making it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="HEATvR"&gt;If you’re looking to step up your TV game and make watching movies and gaming more immersive, Govee offers a range of colorful lighting kits that also make for great holiday gifts. One of its most appealing products are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt;, which sync to whatever you’re watching on your 55-inch or 65-inch screen, making it appear as if the TV colors are bleeding out of the frame and onto your walls. Responsive LED strips like these are typically expensive, but right now Govee’s 2020 backlighting kit costs just $61 once you clip the $10 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the kit’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVGNj7"&gt;Prefer not to shop at Amazon? Govee is selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights"&gt;for $63&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725979/govee-tv-backlight-bars-review-specs-price"&gt;newer version&lt;/a&gt; of these lights, which farther extends the backlighting with Light Bars. Typically $150, you can &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-immersion-kit-wi-fi-tv-backlight-light-bars"&gt;buy this one for $130&lt;/a&gt; from Govee or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B09B7PY111?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$140 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Inb6v"&gt;If you intend to gift these to multiple people, Govee is additionally taking 5 percent off your purchase total when you buy two, 10 percent if you buy three, and 15 percent off if you buy five of them. Use the promo codes &lt;strong&gt;XMAS5&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; XMAS10&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; XMAS15&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the amount you’re purchasing. We found that both the 2020 model and this year’s version offer great value for the money, even before the discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="XieHFJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10896909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeCscB"&gt;If you missed out on a smart display deal during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you’re in luck: Walmart is now &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSmart-Clock-Gen-2-Grey-Color-Smart-Bulb%2F507060083&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a 60 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on the Lenovo Smart Clock 2 with a bundled Lenovo Smart Bulb, bringing the final sale price down to $25. The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display into a form factor that would be right at home on your bedside table. It’s one of the smallest smart displays you can buy, yet it still offers full Google Assistant capabilities and comes with a handy night light feature. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PzrRNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ybzbpN"&gt;The latest AirPods sold out relatively quickly after receiving some of their first significant discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Thankfully, however, Amazon still is selling the third-generation AirPods for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt; at checkout — the lowest we saw them drop to during the recent shopping holiday. That’s a $30 discount on the latest AirPods model, which sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over their last-gen counterpart. However, they lack active noise cancellation, which is found in the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ji1ZJE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10887582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="leY0cM"&gt;If you don’t mind buying refurbished, Sonos is discounting several products right now. For those interested in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt;, the first generation is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundup12221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the full retail cost when purchased new. Although the soundbar lacks support for Dolby Atmos like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. Sonos is also discounting the third-gen Sonos Sub, selling it for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp212121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g3-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$599&lt;/a&gt; refurbished. That is $150 less than if you were to purchase the wireless subwoofer new. The second-gen model, typically $699, is also selling for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp12121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g2-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKhOhp"&gt;All of the products in this sale will arrive in a box with all original accessories and cables, and they’ve been certified directly from Sonos. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;That means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. They also come with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="tqzyYp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;If you missed out on a great TV deal during Black Friday, fret not, because Amazon still offering a significant discount on many sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1.

    <title>Nvidia GeForce Now ‘RTX 3080’ membership tier arrives in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WONgmmhwy9Z4uocDO3OAB2U5Ew8=/0x0:1740x1160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218979/geforce_now.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of the devices GeForce Now streams to.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Vosai"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming service is getting an RTX 3080-themed upgrade in Europe. Nvidia announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;new membership tier in October&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s already available in the US. But, as of today, gamers in Europe can start streaming from the company’s new higher-performance servers, which offer improved resolutions, frame rates, and less latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZhDzi"&gt;The RTX 3080 membership tier offers up to 1440p / 120fps gameplay through PC and Mac, or up to 4K HDR / 60fps when streamed to an Nvidia Shield TV. That’s up from 1080p at 60fps with the current Priority tier. Session lengths can also extend up to eight hours long rather than six, and Nvidia also says the tier offers lower latency. The big tradeoff is price, with the new tier costing £89.89 / $99.99 for a six-month subscription in the UK, up from £44.99 / $49.99 for six months of the Priority tier. But in our testing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;results are impressive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SnUqpu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Costing £89.89 for a six-month membership&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVFit8"&gt;I should note that despite its name, the RTX 3080 membership tier doesn’t stream from servers literally equipped with retail RTX 3080 cards. Instead, it’s an Ampere GA102 chip on a server with an eight-core AMD Threadripper CPU, 28GB of DDR4 memory, and a Gen4 SSD. It’s a hardware combination that Nvidia says offers 35 teraflops of GPU performance, around three times what an Xbox Series X is capable of and actually more in line with the performance of an RTX 3090.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZCWmx"&gt;Nvidia is starting the new tier’s rollout for people who’ve preordered the membership tier in Europe and says that “rollouts for accounts will continue until all requests have been fulfilled.” It’s accepting new orders “pending availability.” As well as the expansion of the membership tier to Europe, Nvidia is also announcing the 20 games that are coming to its service this month, which include indie darling &lt;em&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekDRuw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBUFjS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As tech founders resign, Congress loses its favorite targets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/asowDC_7WU4YSAcpFFNnH1GgvuE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218955/acastro_211130_4903_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But they stand to gain a real chance at change&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="H6RgdA"&gt;On Monday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807578/jack-dorsey-rumor-resign-twitter-ceo-square-web3"&gt;he would be stepping down&lt;/a&gt; from the company he co-founded over 15 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiIDwi"&gt;The news came as a shock to both Twitter’s own users and its investors on Wall Street. But in Dorsey’s resignation letter to staff, he showed no surprise, writing that it was “finally time” for him to leave and that he made his decision to step aside solely on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vvbIu"&gt;His resignation follows years of mounting pressure from Congress against social media platforms like Twitter over concerns ranging from content moderation to monopoly power. Lawmakers have authored bills and held hearings — some in good faith, but perhaps more often in bad — aimed at reining in their power. And like every other major tech CEO, Dorsey has dutifully testified, even if just as an excuse for lawmakers to yell at him for “censoring” them without achieving tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IHbk7"&gt;But this dynamic may finally change under the leadership of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808756/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-jack-dorsey-bluesky-moderation"&gt;Twitter’s new CEO, Parag Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;, its former chief technology officer, as legislators lose a widely recognized figure at whom to aim their frustrations. “Hopefully, we can move past this moment of sort of headlines and CEOs and move into a place of Congress buckling down and meaningfully putting in place some regulations that will rein in control of the industry,” Johnny Mathias, deputy senior campaign director at Color Of Change, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbax3l"&gt;Senators like Ted Cruz (R-TX) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280814/brendan-carr-section-230-republican-party-regulation-social-media"&gt;have scored viral Twitter clips&lt;/a&gt; owning Silicon Valley liberals with hearings on Big Tech, and tech hawks like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have won headlines lauding them for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOdrPruSnrw"&gt;“grilling”&lt;/a&gt; execs like Zuckerberg. But meaningful legislation hasn’t gained much momentum. Still, this relationship has worked for a Congress focused on fundraising or appearing as tough culture warriors in the fight against censorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qg6Uba"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dorsey, as a founder and Silicon Valley figurehead, became not only the face of his company, but a stand-in for social media’s ills as a whole&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rnHlU3"&gt;Dorsey, as a founder and Silicon Valley figurehead, became not only the face of his company, but a stand-in for social media’s ills as a whole. Like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, he was a target to complain about his company’s problems, rather than a conduit for useful negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfPKwB"&gt;Dorsey’s departure from Twitter, coming shortly after Bezos left Amazon, seemingly marks a new phase of tech skepticism in Washington, a shift away from the “brilliant founder” narrative and into a more mature critique of these companies as powerful institutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22810769/big-tech-founders-stepping-down-trend-salesforce-tiktok-amazon"&gt;Without memeable leaders&lt;/a&gt; like Dorsey or Bezos to haul in for splashy, dunk-filled hearings, lawmakers will have more incentive to work on the boring stuff: actually writing policy to change these companies’ behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlUq2W"&gt;Some lawmakers are optimistic that changes in leadership could lead to more fruitful discussions on how to shape the future of the tech industry. “Of course, we haven’t seen tech CEOs step down at Facebook,” Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) told me on Wednesday. “But perhaps if that were to happen, there may be more open-mindedness” to regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STkKo7"&gt;This wave has already caught up with older tech companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973991/trump-tim-cook-apple-friendship-tax-cuts-china-tariffs-manufacturing-jobs"&gt;famously courted support&lt;/a&gt; from President Trump, giving him a tour of the company’s Austin, Texas facilities. Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has built strong relationships with lawmakers, offering expertise on important legislative issues like broadband expansion. These have not always been popular moves with the employees of these companies, but having an executive who’s more willing to work with political leaders clearly changes the tenor of a company’s relationship with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCSaTn"&gt;Google, meanwhile, has been reckoning with political outrage, primarily in the form of potential antitrust violations, for over a decade. In 2012, the European Union — which has generally been way ahead of the US in tech regulation — &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/23/google-eric-schmidt-antitrust"&gt;first demanded that Google change&lt;/a&gt; how it promotes its own products over those of its rivals in search results. Being forced into politicking early on likely influenced Google’s decisions to grow past its founders and put in place a CEO like Sundar Pichai, who has largely avoided turning the company into a flashpoint for political controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPdQmn"&gt;“Google hasn’t created the same sort of headlines for statements of their founders because Pichai is just the CEO,” Johnny Mathias, deputy senior campaign director at Color Of Change, said in a Monday interview. “Facebook has chosen to have a much more public strategy about their decision making. And Google has chosen to be far more withdrawn from your day-to-day politics. For that, they haven’t faced the same sort of scrutiny or pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHE0Ig"&gt;Part of the shift away from founders may be an acknowledgment that times have changed. Twitter was in a much different spot both culturally and politically when Dorsey returned to the company in 2011. At that point in time, “Democrats viewed tech as their industry,” said Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress, a tech industry group. Social media was gaining more mainstream popularity and becoming more widely adopted by users. There was an excitement about tech, not just in the Valley, but in Washington, that likely shaped these companies’ lucrative relationships with government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhUnkR"&gt;But after election night 2016, Facebook and Twitter — once the shining stars of American innovation and global economic leadership — were revealed as a threat to Democrats and their power. Then, the companies pivoted away from a mostly hands-off approach to political speech to a more aggressive one, most notably when Twitter banned Trump from the platform following the January 6th Capitol riot. In doing so, social media created enemies on both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMffVE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;— jack⚡️ (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKNdQe"&gt;In his resignation letter, Dorsey acknowledged that his company had outgrown him as a leader. “There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led.’ Ultimately, I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure,” Dorsey wrote. “There aren’t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we’ll prove this was the right move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwWGdC"&gt;In recent months, lawmakers have proven that they’ve done their homework, authoring legislation that could dramatically alter the tech industry as it operates today. They’ve cobbled together thousands of documents in a sweeping yearslong investigation into anticompetitive conduct. Instead of asking questions about how Facebook makes money off of ads, they’re asking pointed questions about how these ad-driven business models can inflict harm. But most importantly, this outrage is bipartisan, even if Republicans and Democrats disagree on the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLg9a6"&gt;With celebrity founders out of the picture, regulation talks could move in a different direction, favoring expert and activist voices now that powerhouse CEO megaphones are getting unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJD1lJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It feels like things have hit a boiling point around these companies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CqtzcQ"&gt;“I would be hopeful this would grow out of the dynamic of politicians and CEOs and bring it into the space of grassroots activism, researchers, and human rights experts who have been raising these issues for years,” Evan Greer, Fight for the Future director, said on Tuesday. “Lawmakers would do very well to spend more time listening to folks like us than arguing with CEOs for television.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea9jk6"&gt;Others, like Matt Wood, Free Press vice president and general counsel, are more skeptical of founders leaving their companies. “They probably see it as a value as well to turn down the scrutiny to the extent they’ve been kind of human lightning rods for it,” Wood told me. “I think that it’ll actually deprive the entire conversation without the political theater of these hearings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PulRsI"&gt;For now, the pressure on tech companies continues. On Wednesday, a House committee launched its latest series of hearings aimed at reforming tech’s liability shield with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; testifying for a second time on the platform’s potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAMNf6"&gt;“It feels like things have hit a boiling point around these companies,” Greer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdI7qq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpNfzX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon Z FC review: fashion over focus</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It might remind you of a vintage metal camera, but it’s all plastic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="mrgLLY"&gt;Taking photos with my 1967 35mm Nikkormat FTN makes me feel powerful. Its all-metal body with mechanical springs, gears, and levers create a loud, satisfying “clunk” with every shutter press and deep “zip” when advancing the film. Its silver metal body with black faux-leather accents has proven to be not only timeless and eye-catching but, more importantly, incredibly durable. And the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings being located around the barrel of the lens make it incredibly quick to control once your muscle memory has been established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdDRjj"&gt;Outside of the great images this camera can capture, using the FTN is an incredibly fun and satisfying experience. And the Nikon Z FC, Nikon’s latest entry-level mirrorless camera, led me to believe that I might, at long last, have a near-exact digital replica of a camera I love so much. Sadly, the Z FC wasn’t meant to digitally replicate a classic but, instead, inspire a new generation to carry a camera outside of their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nie18rsHvXVfNZ5Makf1vGZ58MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052820/bfarsace_211129_4901_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The articulating screen makes this camera vlog and selfie-ready.﻿&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clAdO3E5rd1mDNkSiEhF5wKsAyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052832/bfarsace_211129_4901_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The faux-leather wrap-around design looks great from afar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RY5QIdvFwN1Yc5RsWO1XLVzMaAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052822/bfarsace_211129_4901_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z FC is a plastic take on Nikon’s 35mm F cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hxHmnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10897081"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rMrSqK"&gt;The Nikon Z FC is a compact APS-C, 20.9-megapixel camera. The body costs $959.95; the $1,096.95 kit I was able to test included a Nikkor Z DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 lens that retracts when not in use for a slim silhouette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDAMRm"&gt;It’s a retro rebrand of Nikon’s entry-level mirrorless camera, the Nikon Z50, with a few added features, such as full-time eye autofocus while shooting video, the ability to accept firmware updates via an app, a faster USB-C port for charging and data transfer, and a fully articulating LCD screen. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/7/5476914/nikon-df-review"&gt;Nikon’s earlier Df&lt;/a&gt;, which took a DSLR and stripped out features in the name of its retro rebuild, the FC isn’t hampered at all — it can shoot full-resolution stills up to 11 frames per second and 4K 30fps video for up to 30 minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqTGWxee48GafqNJlHclMQH1E-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052825/bfarsace_211129_4901_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a micro HDMI, USB-C, and mic port on the left side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6vLpU7q01wwGgPctpUpn4NTY5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052827/bfarsace_211129_4901_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery compartment also houses the SD card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRq5WU-bZ1uUKNLCHJQ5xBKHHQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052826/bfarsace_211129_4901_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z FC uses the same EN-EL25 battery as the Nikon Z50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2C8e7R"&gt;Photos from the Z FC with the 16-50mm kit lens are sharp with a very smooth and pleasing focus fall-off. The RAW files provide a lot of room for brightening shadows or bringing down the highlights. And I was very impressed with how the Z FC handled grain in low-light situations. Instead of a mess of color blotches and pixelation, the low-light grain has a film-esque, even texture to it that, when displayed on a small screen, such as a phone, isn’t distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CrA2ll"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10896940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="f9qKVO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos taken on the Nikon Z FC with the 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 kit lens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="cOUfU5"&gt;The Achilles heel of the Z FC is its slow auto-focus system. Often the camera can’t find any particular object to focus on and will do a fair amount of hunting once a point is locked in. There is focus tracking, in both photo and video modes, that works well in perfect light, but in low light, the camera struggles to hold onto a single point. Also, the green focus assist light is incredibly bright and draws a lot of attention to itself. Pair that with an auto-focus system that often misses the mark, and you might as well be a flashing Christmas tree out attempting to take photos in the dark. The slow kit lens doesn’t help this situation, either; you might have better success with a brighter lens, but I was not able to test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MmnNRs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10896906"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7K1VwF"&gt;In video, the lens’ autofocus is audible when playing back footage and does a lot of hunting, even on faces in bright light. I shot in 4K 24FPS while testing this camera, and while it cannot shoot in the log, the MOV files are crisp and oddly stable in perfect light. I say oddly because the Z FC has no internal stabilization, though the kit lens can provide optical vibration reduction (VR) with a bit of a crop to your frame. The camera’s light weight is a huge help in keeping a shot steady, but I turned off the VR setting and was still surprised at how stable my shots looked. Below is some sample video that I filmed entirely handheld with the VR setting off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6B8wDo"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nikon Zfc sample video 4site|105066" data-volume-uuid="422dc6fc8" data-volume-id="105066" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-862" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="thsC2X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample vlog footage from the Nikon Z FC. All footage shot at 4K 24FPS with the 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 kit lens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="RkFB8X"&gt;But now to the elephant in the room and the biggest difference between the Z FC and the Z50: the look of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2w7NHS"&gt;The Z FC is a plastic take on Nikon’s 35mm F cameras. It shares the same retro look with the iconic silver body, a faux-leather wrap-around design, and dials on top. When I saw it earlier this year, I was instantly excited because it has long been a dream of mine to have a digital version of my Nikkormat FTN, which, although produced by the Japanese company Nippon Kogaku K. K., shares the same design as Nikon’s F cameras. But the moment I held the FC, I knew this wasn’t for film enthusiasts looking for the same manual shooting experience in a digital body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6677n"&gt;Lightweight cameras with plastic parts feel like toys no matter how good the internals might be. The high-pitched click of pulling out the articulating screen or battery compartment and the slippery feel of the plastic body make me question the camera’s durability as well. And although many folks will be happy with this camera’s output, the experience of using it leaves a lot to be desired for a person who has become so used to the sounds and feel of more premium systems. I recorded every sound the Z FC makes in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDTjGL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nikon Z FC sounds 4site|105065" data-volume-uuid="e54e427cb" data-volume-id="105065" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-544" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n89OW6"&gt;All of that is to say this camera is not made for folks coming from all-metal, well-constructed 35mm cameras such as myself. It’s designed to look good from afar and be light enough to take anywhere, but using it feels like playing professional rather than actually being professional. And Nikon has played into the fashion first approach with six color options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DF2MhWm5YvLfrSHGotrE__l69fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052819/bfarsace_211129_4901_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three dials on top of the camera: ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fjo8saS6t5debZfzMxQ4u-ZqNbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052821/bfarsace_211129_4901_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buttons being on the left hand side makes it tough to operate this camera with one hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDYya0"&gt;The Nikon Z FC is a great entry-level camera for fashion-forward folks who will be motivated to carry this camera everywhere because of its retro design. With most controls being set to dials on the top of the camera, the system is easy to use, and the quality of the images and video is very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKPjN2"&gt;Fujifilm and Leica cameras remain the closest experience to shooting with all-metal vintage camera bodies because of their many manual control wheels and solid construction. As for the Z FC, it’s a great camera for $959.95, but it does not provide the same experience of the cameras Nikon designed it to look like. Its looks are instead intended to attract an audience that wants to look the part of a photographer without having to carry the heavy gear that was once needed to be one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available now at Target (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OapvD4IKThc6ZJfmjG5SUKKRlX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218663/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jaBuNG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:50AM ET, December 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Target appears to have sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zg3za0"&gt;Shopping for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days is starting to feel like hunting for toilet paper during the early days of the pandemic. Thankfully, however, if you still haven’t been able to land one, right now Target is giving you another shot, with online ordering for in-store pickup at stores near you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldz2XY"&gt;Listings for the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt; went up first, followed by the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 digital edition&lt;/a&gt;. Sales for the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; are live now too, but online the only option is the $34.99 All Access subscription package, as the page notes that direct purchases are in-store only. For all of these, availability will depend on your local supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LeQZ1"&gt;And if you already have a next-gen console (or don’t need one to play last-gen games) the page for Microsoft’s novelty &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2F-%2FA-83343001&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99 Xbox Series mini-fridge&lt;/a&gt; shows it’s due for a restock as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6XL6g"&gt;We recommend making sure you sign in to your Target account early while you wait, preload any payment information, and make sure your billing and shipping information is current. It’ll reduce the time it takes to check out, thus increasing your chances of landing the console. Because these orders are for in-store pickup, keep trying to add your items to the cart even if they appear to be sold out at first — stores near you may load their available stock a few minutes later, or reload it in waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to nab one today, don’t worry – we will continue posting updates as more restocks happen. We are also happy to save you money on everyday purchases – which include the hottest video games, gaming peripherals, and more – so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Our team has also included some great gaming accessories below you can enjoy in the meantime as well, some of which are even on sale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows prompts try to stop people downloading Chrome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/liXI00Ari8Bt98RdjV3cZYUtOEM=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218551/chromedownloadprompt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Edge prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSCbBW"&gt;Microsoft has never been a fan of Windows users downloading Chrome instead of using Edge, but the company has now stepped up its campaign to keep people using its built-in browser. Windows 10 and Windows 11 have both started displaying new prompts when people navigate to the Chrome download page, in an effort to discourage people from installing Google’s rival browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g61r9E"&gt;These new prompts, &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-says-its-own-edge-browser-is-more-trustworthy-than-so-2008-google-chrome/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include messages like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aFauYh"&gt;“Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X9zcq6"&gt;“That browser is so 2008! Do you know what’s new? Microsoft Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RQUSSA"&gt;“‘I hate saving money,’ said no one ever. Microsoft Edge is the best browser for online shopping.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8mV_5-eINze3Wr_UoJ-ldVn23cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057686/8qTMWBQ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4l0iv"&gt;We’ve been able to confirm at least one prompt on a Windows 11 PC, and it appears these new prompts are also appearing for some Windows 10 users, too. These aren’t pop-ups or prompts you’d typically find inside a website, either. They’re rendered natively by Edge, and other websites aren’t able to display similar prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYRoaw"&gt;That makes these a little different from the messages that Google displays when you’re running Edge and use its online services, which appear within webpages when you visit services like Google Search and Gmail. Google uses these to try to encourage users to switch to Chrome over Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDSVS3"&gt;Microsoft’s new prompts come more than three years after the company first started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850146/microsoft-windows-10-chrome-firefox-warning"&gt;testing ways to warn Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt; not to install Chrome or Firefox. Those tests were never rolled out publicly, but these prompts are now starting to appear for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiYeso"&gt;Microsoft has also been making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;harder to switch default browsers&lt;/a&gt; in Windows 11 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;forcing people into using Edge&lt;/a&gt; through Windows updates. These latest prompts also follow widespread criticism of Microsoft building a “buy now, pay later” tool directly into Edge that prompts users to use a short-term financing service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Google’s experimental 3D telepresence booth works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLMHd3KV4WgZisScTZGP68uDKko=/0x0:760x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218524/msedge_jMrBs47Heb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nxz6R"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/424ee26722e5863f1ce17890d9499ba9a964d84f.pdf"&gt;new research paper&lt;/a&gt;, Google has detailed the tech behind its impressive Project Starline demo from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442336/google-project-starline-3d-video-chat-platform"&gt;this year’s I/O conference&lt;/a&gt;. Project Starline is essentially a 3D video chat booth that aims to replace a one-on-one 2D video conference call with an experience that feels like you’re actually sitting in front of a real human being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwdvsa"&gt;It sounds simple, but Google’s research paper highlights just how many challenges there are in tricking your brain into thinking there’s a real human being sitting just a few feet away from you. Obviously the image needs to be high resolution and free of distracting artifacts, but it also needs to look correct from your relative position in the booth. Audio is another challenge, as the system needs to make it sound like a person’s words are coming from their actual mouth. And then there’s just the small matter of eye-contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcWiOh"&gt;But, eventually, the hope is that Project Starline could offer a similar feeling of presence as virtual or augmented reality, without users needing to wear bulky headsets or trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGUrOgIq-mIXal6RJTFbRvAMSgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057671/msedge_R8BM20N2BK.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display unit and its various tracking hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rI0rtV"&gt;The paper details exactly how much hardware is needed to start to solve these problems. The system is built around a large 65-inch 8K panel which runs at 60Hz. Around it, Google’s engineers have arranged three “capture pods’’ which are capable of capturing both color imagery and depth data. The system also includes four additional tracking cameras, four microphones, two loudspeakers, and infrared projectors. In total, color images from four viewpoints are captured, as well as three depth maps, for a total of seven video streams. Audio is captured at 44.1 kHz, and encoded at 256 Kbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhergU"&gt;Obviously all of this hardware generates a lot of data that needs to be transmitted, and Google says that transmission bandwidth ranges anywhere from 30Mbps up to 100Mbps, depending on “the texture detail in the user’s clothes and the magnitude of their gestures.” So it’s significantly more than a standard Zoom call, but nothing a typical office in a metropolitan area couldn’t handle. Project Starline is equipped with four high-end Nvidia graphics cards (two Quadro RTX 6000 cards and two Titan RTX’s) to encode and decode all this data. End-to-end latency reportedly averages 105.8 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jLhXg0G401kTZqOH2gU4ebQLsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057672/msedge_bryqKVi33l.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The system is made up of a backlight unit and display unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G0kJZp"&gt;The way Google’s research paper tells it, employees who’ve used Starline across the three sites where it’s been installed think it beats traditional videoconferencing when it comes to creating a feeling of presence, personal connection, as well as helping with attentiveness, and reaction-gauging. The company says that over nine months, 117 participants held a total of 308 meetings in its telepresence booths, with an average meeting time of just over 35 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBliVT"&gt;It all sounds very promising, but as yet there’s no indication of when, or even if, the system might one day be commercialized. There’s also very little information about how much Starline’s extensive array of hardware will cost in reality (although Table 4 in the research paper outlines the tracking and display hardware it uses, if you fancy doing some math). For now, Google says it’s expanding Project Starline’s availability “in more Google offices around the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OznqmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9PRXl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
