    <title>Bethesda is making an Indiana Jones game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2F85jiHtxBsY3RjayDjsK5UNdo=/245x0:2297x1368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655554/Screen_Shot_2021_01_12_at_11.05.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzLyoQ"&gt;Bethesda’s next project is a big surprise: today, the publisher teased a new Indiana Jones game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yt0YWD"&gt;While we don’t know anything about the title just yet — the announcement was simply a brief teaser video — it’s being developed by MachineGames, the same studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Bethesda boss Todd Howard will serve as executive producer. The title is being made under the new Lucasfilm Games label, &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/lucasfilm-games"&gt;which was announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; as part of a renewed focus on games from Disney and Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zMATf"&gt;While details are slim, Disney says that “the game will tell a wholly original, standalone tale set at the height of the career of the famed adventurer.” The teaser video hints that the game will take place in Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lMHEA"&gt;There’s no word yet on when the game will release or what platforms it will be on. At this point, it doesn’t even have a full title.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp clarifies it’s not giving all your data to Facebook after surge in Signal and Telegram users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyRQ9C77_9F93SSHhJ89__7bTqE=/11x0:1091x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655548/verge-whatsapp-notification-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbyrdH"&gt;WhatsApp has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy"&gt;published a new FAQ page to its website&lt;/a&gt; outlining its stances on user privacy in response to widespread backlash over an upcoming privacy policy update. The core issue relates to WhatsApp’s data-sharing procedures with Facebook, with many users concerned an updated privacy policy going into effect on February 8th will mandate sharing of sensitive profile information with WhatsApp’s parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75jCOu"&gt;That isn’t true — the update has nothing to do with consumer chats or profile data, and instead the change is designed to outline how businesses who use WhatsApp for customer service may store logs of its chats on Facebook servers. That’s something the company feels it is required to disclose in its privacy policy, which it’s now doing after &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;previewing the upcoming changes to business chats back in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a9HwwZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6qDnzQ98MP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uFQUnI"&gt;But a wave of misinformation on social media, not helped by Facebook’s abysmal track record on privacy and its reputation for obfuscating changes to its various terms of service agreements, has resulted in a full-blown WhatsApp backlash that has users fleeing to competitors like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9k3FU"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even jumped into the fray, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153"&gt;tweeting last week “Use Signal”&lt;/a&gt; to his more than 42 million followers. As the controversy has grown, Signal has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;become one of the most downloaded apps on Android and iOS&lt;/a&gt; and its verification system for signing up new users has repeatedly buckled under the pressure. Telegram, on the other hand, saw more than 25 million new users sign up in just the last 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehg6D4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Telegram surpassed 500 million active users. 25 million new users joined in the last 72 hours: 38% came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. &lt;a href="https://t.co/1LptHZb9PQ"&gt;https://t.co/1LptHZb9PQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Telegram Messenger (@telegram) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQ5edB"&gt;WhatsApp executives, as well as Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and Facebook AR / VR head Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, are now trying to set the record straight, perhaps to little avail at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wi6BlY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is a lot of misinformation about the WhatsApp ToS right now. The policy update does *not* affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. The changes are related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/b7szUeinKX"&gt;https://t.co/b7szUeinKX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1348999006156972033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xt4UEz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is not accurate, fwiw&lt;a href="https://t.co/hUy1AIKCeT"&gt;https://t.co/hUy1AIKCeT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1348301149732958208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnAT8j"&gt;“We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data,” the company writes on the new FAQ page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZiqfg"&gt;It also stresses in the FAQ that neither Facebook nor WhatsApp read users’ message logs or listen to their calls, and that WhatsApp doesn’t store user location data or share contact information with Facebook. (It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347183889995935744"&gt;data sharing with Facebook is extremely limited for European users&lt;/a&gt; due to stronger user privacy protections in the EU.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4QaXB"&gt;WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660775603597312"&gt;took to Twitter a few days ago&lt;/a&gt; to post a thread (later shared by Bosworth in the tweet above) trying to cut through the confusion and explain what’s actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR7Kyr"&gt;“With end-to-end encryption, we cannot see your private chats or calls and neither can Facebook. We’re committed to this technology and committed to defending it globally,” Cathcart wrote. “It’s important for us to be clear this update describes business communication and does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook. It does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lYIxvB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s why we are so committed to end-to-end encryption, and why we keep improving the privacy of WhatsApp, such as with our launch of disappearing messages in November.  Our innovation on privacy will continue.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660775603597312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DMJmRB"&gt;A bit of irony in all of this is the data sharing WhatsApp users are so keen to avoid has already likely been happening for a vast majority of those who use the messaging platform. The company let users opt out of data sharing with Facebook for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;only a brief amount of time back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, two years after Facebook purchased the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CuImy"&gt;After that, new sign-ups and those who didn’t manually opt out of data sharing have had some WhatsApp information, principally their phone number and profile name, shared with the larger social network for ad targeting and other purposes. (If you did opt out, WhatsApp says it will honor that even after the February 8th update, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/whatsapp-to-require-users-to-share-data-with-facebook-via-new-privacy-policy"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnuNTK"&gt;If you look at the privacy labels for WhatsApp on the App Store, labels Apple only last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;began forcing developers to disclose&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see scores of information that is marked as “data linked to you,” although only a unique device ID and app usage data is listed as used for “developer’s advertising and marketing.” (WhatsApp tried &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;publicly calling Apple out&lt;/a&gt; for not making its own first-party apps adhere to the same standards, only for Apple to reply that it does in fact list privacy labels for the iOS apps it develops.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MVMfv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WhatsApp has become a victim of Facebook’s poor privacy reputation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77I6nP"&gt;In the upcoming privacy policy change, language regarding data sharing with Facebook was changed, leading many to believe the new mandated data sharing was a new change that could not be avoided — even though it’s been happening all along. “As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies,” reads WhatsApp’s &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. “We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n53xbk"&gt;This whole controversy may be chalked up to users misreading confusing media reports, jumping to conclusions, and then participating in scaremongering on social media. But it’s  also a reality Facebook must contend with that the lack of trust in WhatsApp is directly related to years of bad faith privacy pledges from Facebook and increasingly complex terms of service agreements no regular, non-lawyer user can reasonably comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIg5pZ"&gt;It’s no wonder then that users are flocking to an app like Signal — managed by a nonprofit and subsisting on donations and wealthy benefactors like &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-foundation-whatsapp-brian-acton/"&gt;none other than WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton&lt;/a&gt; — when they feel they can no longer trust what’s really happening when they message their friends on their smartphone. Now, Facebook and WhatsApp face a long road of transparent communication and trust-building ahead if they want to get those people back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Exynos chip expected to power the Galaxy S21 internationally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ztuo8HCL6A9Jpo735jiFJS7Ow7o=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655500/Exynos_2100_dl1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGQASl"&gt;Samsung has announced the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-sets-new-standard-for-flagship-mobile-processors-with-exynos-2100?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;Exynos 2100&lt;/a&gt;, the mobile processor that’s expected to power its upcoming Galaxy S21 flagship across much of the world outside the US. Like the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/products/mobileprocessor/exynos-1080/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Exynos 1080&lt;/a&gt; announced last year, it’s built using a 5nm fabrication process, and it’s got an integrated 5G modem that can handle both Sub-6GHz and mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWWOuM"&gt;At the heart of the Exynos 2100 processor is an octa-core CPU which includes one Arm Cortex-X1 core clocked at 2.9GHz, three Cortex-A78 cores, and four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores. This CPU is paired with an Arm Mali-G78 GPU, and a tri-core NPU (neural processing unit) for handling AI tasks. Altogether, Samsung says the Exynos offers 10 percent more performance than its 7nm predecessor, or 20 percent lower power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SXrcPc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sub-6Ghz and mmWave 5G are both supported&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeySah"&gt;In terms of camera sensors, the Exynos 2100 supports resolutions of up to 200 megapixels and can connect to as many as six sensors at a time. It’s also able to handle feeds from as many as four cameras at a time, which Samsung says could be used for better zoom or ultrawide photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBv7T9"&gt;While Samsung is expected to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; in the Galaxy S21 in the US, it’s this Exynos processor that’ll likely power the phone across much of the rest of the world. However, this dual-processor approach has been criticized in the past when benchmarks have shown that the Exynos chips aren’t as capable as their Snapdragon equivalents (&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s20-snapdragon-vs-exynos-performance-1094471/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; has a good rundown&lt;/a&gt; of the differences last year). With the Exynos 2100, Samsung is no doubt hoping to close the performance gap between its chips and Qualcomm’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6xca4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04POr0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microplastics from laundry are flooding into the Arctic   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snow covered mountains at Billefjorden at sunset and clouds reflected in the Arctic sea, central fjord of Isfjorden, Svalbard / Spitsbergen, Norway." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tipSQh1epMStIikvGBIjVhbxw3w=/0x0:5100x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655453/1265235373.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ENYJSl"&gt;Polyester fibers are making their way from laundry machines in North America and Europe all the way up to the Arctic, according to a new study. Synthetic fibers made up a whopping 92 percent of microplastic pollution found in Arctic seawater, of which polyester was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TNLIhU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you and I wear, how we wash our clothes, and what we buy at the clothing store is really having profound consequences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbHVMw"&gt;That means that textiles, laundry, and wastewater are likely big culprits when it comes microplastics polluting the world’s oceans, according to study authors. The polyester fibers they found in the Arctic are the same size as fibers found in water from laundry machines and wastewater treatment plants. Much of it is drifting into the Arctic from the Atlantic ocean, the findings suggest — which points to North America and Europe as the source of those fibers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBceEd"&gt;“What you and I wear, how we wash our clothes, and what we buy at the clothing store is really having profound consequences for an area, many thousands of kilometers from our communities,” says Peter Ross, lead author of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-20347-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226655%2Fmicroplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gdp1Y"&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand what all those microplastics mean for the Arctic, its marine life, and communities that live there. Ross says he wanted to study microplastics along the entire water column — from the seafloor to the surface — in part because it’s where a lot of sea life looks for food. One &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/9/2331#ref-5"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; is that the plastics can obstruct animals’ intestines when they eat them, and make them feel full even when they’re not getting the nutrients they need, according to Ross. There are also still questions about how the chemicals found in plastics could affect animals or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who eat them. Indigenous Inuit have already coped with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/04/11/poisons-from-afar-threaten-arctic-mothers-traditions/89af6e09-c411-4b6f-bc97-4839963e9208/"&gt;pollutants like DDT&lt;/a&gt; that move north from thousands of miles away. The same pattern appears to be happening with microplastics, Ross says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pzxy36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Atlantic ocean feeds more plastic pollution to the Arctic &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0a9J1J"&gt;Ross and his colleagues studied seawater samples from 71 locations across the Arctic — a broader look at the problem than previous studies. They found three times more microplastic particles in the eastern Arctic than in the west. They also saw that fibers found further west were shorter and more weathered, suggesting that they had traveled there from the east. That’s how they were able to determine that the Atlantic ocean feeds more plastic pollution to the Arctic than the Pacific. It also signals that the notorious &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/12/5891817/plastic-garbage-patches"&gt;Great Pacific garbage patch&lt;/a&gt; probably isn’t contributing as much to the microplastics problem in the Arctic as previously thought, according to Melanie Bergmann, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60eQnD"&gt;Bergmann and other researchers have found microplastics in Arctic &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1157"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2018/ArtMID/7878/ArticleID/787/Microplastics-in-the-Marine-Realms-of-the-Arctic-with-Special-Emphasis-on-Sea-Ice"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-020-61948-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226655%2Fmicroplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. But distinguishing between types of plastic and their sources has been more difficult in the past. Ross’ study uses technology called Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that became available in just the past few years. It can compare the infrared signal of a mystery particle to a library of over 250,000 materials to identify whether fiber likely came from a polyester textile or, say, nylon fishing gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qcPWh"&gt;“Simply documenting microplastics in the Arctic is interesting, but without it leading to source identification, it’s not going to allow managers, decision makers, industry, and other parties to actually solve the problem,” Ross says. Each time we run a washing machine, hundreds of thousands of microplastics can find their way into the environment by taking a ride on wastewater, &lt;a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/washing-clothes-releases-thousands-of-microplastic-particles-into-environment-study-shows"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found. Some brands have already started making fabrics that shed fewer fibers when they’re washed and that alone can make a tremendous difference, Ross points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RQ3vrE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to take action on land.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPB4Bq"&gt;“If we are finding microplastics and especially fibrous microplastics in waters of this seemingly pristine location, that emphasizes to us that we need to take action on land,” says La Daana Kanhai, a marine scientist at the University of the West Indies who has also studied microplastic pollution in the Arctic and discovered polyester fibers in sea ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVrHdA"&gt;“The more we look, the more we realize just how we have contaminated the farthest corners of the planet with microplastics,” Ross says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsihD7"&gt;There’s even more plastic out there that scientists still can’t see, both Ross and Bergmann acknowledge. The new study excludes plastic particles smaller than 10 microns. “There’s much more out there, very likely,” says Bergmann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNAD7y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVLxQr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Mario 3D World will launch in February alongside a new Nintendo Switch color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aRMIz-FkHGk5EKhClCfXZKUPcgs=/486x0:5736x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655436/SM3DW_Lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1upoVN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt;, an enhanced version of the original game that bundles in a new expansion called &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;, will launch on February 12th for the Switch. Nintendo announced the news today along with a new Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcpE3z"&gt;The upgraded version of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt; features both online and local co-op for up to four players. The special edition Switch, modeled after Mario’s plumber outfit, will be available at select retailers for $299.99. In addition to a carrying case and red Joy-Con controllers with blue trim, the Switch itself is red — a first for the typically all-black console. Nintendo is also selling new amiibo figures of Cat Mario and Cat Peach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJULOd"&gt;Nintendo revealed the game’s arrival on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418988/super-mario-3d-world-all-stars-nintendo-switch"&gt;Switch last fall&lt;/a&gt; alongside news of other classic game returns for Mario’s 35th anniversary. As part of that anniversary, Nintendo is also holding special challenges available to players with a Nintendo Switch Online membership. The first challenge asks players to collectively defeat 3.5 million Bowsers in-game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM surprises with autonomous Cadillac and flying car concepts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBm1cCGxY4mzWUP7dkBZS22dMyU=/88x0:1054x644/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655406/cadillac_halo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: GM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L79VT2"&gt;CES wouldn’t be CES without some bonkers, far-out vehicle concepts. And thankfully, General Motors brought two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSULz"&gt;The automaker showed off a luxury egg-shaped autonomous vehicle and a single-seater electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft during its keynote address on Tuesday. Both vehicles are part of Cadillac’s Halo Portfolio and probably won’t be going into production anytime soon — or at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdPr83"&gt;Still, the concepts are meant to show off Cadillac’s (and, by extension, GM’s) design intentions for future products, as well as serving as an extravagant symbol of the brand’s manufacturing skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Akmhla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An extravagant symbol of the brand’s manufacturing skills&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uIKbqQ"&gt;The AV concept looks like a leather-and-fur-draped version of many of the autonomous people-mover shuttles that we’ve seen in college towns and corporate campuses around the globe. It lacks traditional controls like a steering wheel and pedals, instead opting for an interior that looks more like a 1970s-era sunken living room. Michael Simcoe, GM’s VP of Global Design, described it as “a social space for a group of friends or family to spend time together on their way to a destination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B5ORT"&gt;The vehicle features a vertical light signature, expansive glass roof, and biometric sensors to read passengers’ vital signs and use that data to adjust settings like temperature, lighting, ambient noises, and even aromatics. Other options, like voice control and gesture recognition, will ensure making those adjustments is mostly effortless (depending on the quality of the technology, of course). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjLLq4"&gt;The VTOL concept looks like a more futuristic version of some of the air taxi prototypes that are under development right now. Simcoe called it GM’s “first foray into aerial mobility” — although it’s just a design exercise, and it’s unclear whether GM actually intends to pursue a commercialized version. (A spokesperson for the automaker declined to make any images available or provide additional details about both concepts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FcMi8F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10279725"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DFf6UE"&gt;Simcoe said the Cadillac eVTOL aircraft would use a 90kWh electric motor to power four rotors to enable vertical takeoff and landing. That’s less battery capacity than other eVTOL startups, like Germany’s Lilium, which uses 320kWh motors to power its five-person jet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZGjAA"&gt;The AV and eVTOL concepts were not the centerpiece of GM’s announcements at CES. That was reserved for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;the automaker’s new delivery and logistics spinoff business, BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. But they were a welcome sight at an event that has been diminished and scaled back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kudos to GM for refusing to let the virus take all the fun out of CES. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now, you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1760a049c05833dc1017f6d4057815bf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=9&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1bb3f1fd7fd46e44af2bcb7b4e69ac37&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the fourth-gen Echo Dot at Amazon, the retailer is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=6&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a703bc6b8141b27e290f322ffa1dd1f6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $50&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DOT2PACK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3b2eb028219e410a9d64a5272c5f5c00&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a single Amazon Echo smart speaker, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d1731cf9b61b13aa734867a184283f9a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9dd29d118d711aac9ce70db04cc48e45&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;In 2019, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And, of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, there’s no active deals on the Echo Buds, but you can get them for its usual price of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3619c9cbf19d90024732c6f012617549&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-965" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-466" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2F-%2F6394628.p%3Fu1%3D%255B%255Dvg%255Be%255D21988756%255Br%255Dtheverge.com%252Fauthors%255Bt%255Dw%255Bd%255DD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Weird flex: TCL shows off two more of its rollable, extendable display concepts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oeWa9_KXQymfy3aK1zxsAvSBxnk=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655003/LYS_9352_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of TCL’s many display concept prototypes.  | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fch6Kl"&gt;TCL has never been shy about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showcasing its display concepts&lt;/a&gt; at trade shows, and this year is no different; the company is (virtually) showing off a couple of these prototypes at CES 2021. Bearing in mind that there’s absolutely no guarantee these concepts will ever reach market, they’re still a fun glimpse at a possible future of display tech. First up is a mobile device with an AMOLED “rollable” screen which can extend a 6.7-inch display up to 7.8 inches. TCL says the device is less than 10mm thick with a 3mm bend radius.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LntOdWD6vCfAIeIVbVpxY4NZj8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228685/Jan_11_2021_13_26_56.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL calls this a rollable display, though there’s no outwardly obvious rolling action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wWKRU8"&gt;A similar concept appears in one of the more unintentionally funny promotional videos we’ve seen at CES so far this year. It’s an extendable display concept that unrolls on two sides, like a scroll, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;an “I’m Gonna Steal the Declaration of Independence,”&lt;/a&gt; which is a technical term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We7Szl"&gt;TCL says the screen itself is also thinner at just 0.18mm thick. The company tries to drive home the space-saving advantages of this concept with a video of a hiker pulling it out of a bag on the trail. Unfortunately, it looks about as authentic as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;our favorite folding gadgets of sci-fi&lt;/a&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj-GLDzQZQ14TfLMnotVvSzoN00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228752/Jan_11_2021_13_52_13.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58LyxA"&gt;TCL does appear to have a working prototype version of this technology, though it’s smaller and not quite as robust-looking as the hiker video would suggest. And while the company says it will bring a foldable / flexible product to market this year, we’d put our money on a regular ol’ folding phone — it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;working on one for a while now&lt;/a&gt; — rather than one of these concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM unveils electric delivery van with 250 miles of range as part of new spinoff business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuoCpLkdi15nQ6ZXU9O-5l83kQ4=/0x0:7800x5200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654956/BrightDrop_EV600_image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7BoBE9"&gt;General Motors announced Tuesday it will be spinning out a new delivery and logistics business called BrightDrop, the first products of which will be an electrified pallet and delivery van. Both vehicles, which will be powered by GM’s Ultium battery platform, are slated for release this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyNSa3"&gt;The announcement of the new logistics business comes as GM is undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;a massive, $27 billion pivot&lt;/a&gt; to the business of designing and manufacturing electric vehicles. For example, the company, which is the largest automaker in North America, just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;new logo as part of an overall brand redesign&lt;/a&gt;. GM has been nipping at the heels of Tesla and other EV makers as it attempts to convince its investors that it has a firm grasp on the future of electric-powered transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqHG6b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM has been nipping at the heels of Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="totfZF"&gt;BrightDrop will be a key piece of that pivot, in which hundreds of thousands of electric delivery vehicles are expected to hit the road in the years to come. GM envisions the new company “creating a one-stop shop, a complete ecosystem” for electric-powered delivery, including vehicles, software, and other services, said Pamela Fletcher, VP of GM’s global EV program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTKfNL"&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4jbiOMG2oVreRkRO2xxBmzf9YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229883/BrightDrop_EP1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFQ9l1"&gt;The first vehicle to roll out with the BrightDrop branding will be a delivery pallet called EP1. The pallet, which can be used to transport packages from a delivery vehicle to a customer’s front door, will have an Ultium-powered electric propulsion that will allow a top speed of 3 mph. Packages can be secured within the EP1 pallet, which comes with adjustable shelving and lockable cabinet-style doors. In addition, EP1 can carry up to 23 cubic feet of cargo and will have a payload capacity of 200 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VuPGz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a top speed of 3 mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmY2nf"&gt;Fletcher says that the EP1 is meant to address the problem seen with package delivery today, in which “packages are often strewn on city sidewalks,” haphazardly and unsecured. “We saw this as a solution to create a completely different environment for delivery,” Fletcher continued, “really to help package touch points, reduce errors, reduce physical strain on those delivering the goods, help optimize curb time, and help reduce overall operational costs for businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKQHEq"&gt;GM partnered with FedEx Express on a pilot last year to test out the EP1. Using the electric pallet allowed FedEx workers to handle 25 percent more packages a day, Fletcher said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PShWZJE6dX5Zkh1VcgVVWpX2xzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229885/BrightDrop_EV600_image_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UV2r16"&gt;The EP1 will go into production in “early 2021,” Fletcher said. Following that will be the EV600, a 250-mile range delivery van with 600 cubic feet of cargo space and a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds. It will have a peak charge rate of up to 170 miles per hour when hooked up to a 120kW DC fast charger. That vehicle will go into production in late 2021, with the first vehicles to be delivered by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqGJ0b"&gt;The BrightDrop EV600 will include a security system with motion sensors to help keep the cargo area secure. Other features include front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways, and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door. The commercial vehicles will come with a number of advanced driver assist features, including blind spot detection, lane keep assist, and front and rear parking assist. A fairly sizable 13.4-inch digital infotainment screen is sure to be the centerpiece of the interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ehzHr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx has expressed interest in buying an unspecified number of EV600 delivery vans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbpw7U"&gt;FedEx has expressed interest in buying an unspecified number of EV600 delivery vans, said Fletcher, who also alluded to several other unnamed interested customers. “We have letters of intent signed from a number of other customers, and we want to be talking to you about those in the not too distant future,” she said. Fletcher declined to reveal the suggested retail price for the EP1 and EV600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrJCTG"&gt;BrightDrop is also offering a range of software to customers who purchase its new commercial vehicles. This will enable customers to track the location of each EP1 pallet, remote lock and unlock each pallet, and monitor battery status. EV600 will also get battery status and location monitoring features, as well as driver safety coaching and incident recording, remote diagnostics, safety alerts and predictive maintenance insights, and over-the-air updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sfir5k"&gt;Rumors of a GM-made electric delivery van, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280862/gm-bv1-electric-van-delivery-ultium-amazon-ford-transit"&gt;nicknamed “BV1,”&lt;/a&gt; first surfaced last year, after the company unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium EV platform&lt;/a&gt; along with plans to roll out two dozen new electric vehicles over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E22Zgz"&gt;GM has found success with its Chevrolet Express and, to a lesser extent, GMC Savana cargo vans. But it’s far from the only company working on an electric van. Mercedes-Benz is making &lt;a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/388696/mercedes-benz-esprinter-electric-van/"&gt;an electric version of its popular Sprinter&lt;/a&gt; van, while Ford recently revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;E-Transit&lt;/a&gt; with 126 miles of range and a $45,000 price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;Amazon is working on an all-electric delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt; with the EV startup Rivian. Two other startups recently unveiled electric vans: Bollinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405451/bollinger-electric-delivery-van-production-price-specs"&gt;with its Deliver-E&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt; with its scalable vehicle, both due in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJUGOD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5kqIf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeqdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgRp0q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
