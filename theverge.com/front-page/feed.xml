    <title>Sony was bringing PlayStation Now to mobile phones, according to a confidential Apple presentation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cB1Lly"&gt;In 2017 — long before Apple declared that cloud gaming could only exist on the iPhone if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;jumped through gigantic hoops&lt;/a&gt; — Sony was preparing to launch its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service on mobile phones, a confidential document reveals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocH39i"&gt;It could have been the single biggest expansion of Sony’s PS Now game service in years. Originally, the service streamed PS2 and PS3 games to smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and the PS3 and PS Vita, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;cut off all those original platforms in late 2017&lt;/a&gt; (coincidence?) to focus on the PlayStation 4 and Windows PC instead. While it recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397555/playstation-now-1080p-streaming-support-resolution"&gt;1080p streaming&lt;/a&gt; and a PS5 client, it’s never been offered on Android, iOS, or Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJK83"&gt;But according to a confidential document unearthed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from the&lt;em&gt; Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple had insider knowledge of Sony’s upcoming launch. Apple had heard about a “[not-yet-announced] mobile extension of an existing streaming service for PlayStation users, streaming access to over 450+ PS3 games to start, with PS4 games to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNqD5z"&gt;A handful of PS4 games launched on PlayStation Now in July 2017, but the presentation notes that the service is “only PS3 games right now,” suggesting Apple got tipped off about more than just the move to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQIpa4A3pK-VvvsiYvmq1HnKaDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080005/ps_now_mobile.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Now is listed as a “mobile” subscription&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in a document labeled “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iINjJs"&gt;Why did Apple bring this up? It’s smack dab in the middle of an explanation of Apple’s plans to launch its own game subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t be announced until two years later. At the time, Apple was preparing to target 30 top game studios and ask for as many as “a few hundred titles” to add.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmpcx0LbKMEsJ6luj_yXTZMCeag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080073/apple_games_subs.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple describes its “game subscription service,” which would launch as Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqhn65"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;I wrote that Sony squandered the opportunity to be a leader in cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the first major company to recognize its potential, buying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the early startups (Gaikai and OnLive) that proved out the idea. But despite Apple’s resistance to cloud gaming on the App Store — read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;my new story about what happened with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — there’s an intriguing possibility that Sony isn’t giving up yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Sony reportedly now has a Project Spartacus&lt;/a&gt; that would bundle its cloud gaming service with a PlayStation Plus subscription, and it would bring original PS1 games and “eventually” PS5 games to the service too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRSIgj"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Jason Schreier’s scoop for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mention mobile phones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmK2x1"&gt;While it’s possible Sony read the room and decided it wasn’t worth fighting Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming"&gt;the way Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and Google did for mobile access, it might also be that Sony decided to focus on selling more consoles instead — if you do have a PS4 or PS5 in your house, the company’s PS Remote Play app already lets you stream it (perhaps even &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2021/09/14/ps4-remote-play-ps5-games-over-mobile-data-update-download-broadcast-ios-android-iphone/"&gt;over cellular&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429291/sony-ps5-remote-play-dualsense-apple-mac-iphone-ipod-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;to a wide array of Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Android. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;stream a new PS5 to your old PS4&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a new lease on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5t8Yy"&gt;Sony wouldn’t comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story explaining in detail the scary Teams bug that blocked a 911 call</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVIDy3"&gt;Sometimes when technology bugs out, I like a good and heavy analysis on why something didn’t work as intended. Mishaal Rahman, former editor in chief at &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, wrote an excellent explainer on why a 911 call on a Google Pixel 3 with Microsoft Teams failed during a real emergency — aptly titled: “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;How a bug in Android and Microsoft Teams could have caused this user’s 911 call to fail&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vACzdj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;Rahman’s story&lt;/a&gt; explains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826272/911-failure-google-android-microsoft-teams-bug"&gt;recent situation&lt;/a&gt; of a Pixel 3 user frantically trying to call 911 but attempts kept freezing the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pt0THx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New: How a bug in Android and Microsoft Teams could have caused this user’s 911 call to fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a high-level technical analysis explaining that weird Android 911/Microsoft Teams bug.&lt;a href="https://t.co/hjFIm7GGn3"&gt;https://t.co/hjFIm7GGn3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tip &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Techmeme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Techmeme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1469373893534232584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkJ0I"&gt;Even if you start &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;reading the article&lt;/a&gt; from the middle — or even skim it — you still get a fascinating look on how the Android OS interfaces with apps like Teams that have phone call features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UuDWnI"&gt;Even without analyzing the decompiled code of the Microsoft Teams app, it’s easy to confirm that there’s a bug in the app that results in the excessive registration of PhoneAccount instances. Whenever the Microsoft Teams app is installed but the user has not signed in, &lt;strong&gt;every cold launch of the app results in the creation of another PhoneAccount instance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ur8wB9"&gt;If you have an app like Teams on your Android phone that can make “phone calls” (looks kind of like a regular cellular call), &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;the article explains in depth&lt;/a&gt; how an app will add itself to a list of “PhoneAccounts” that the system can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W02SDv"&gt;If you’re someone who’s interested in the inner workings of Android — specifically how the OS can fumble emergency phone calls (and where Microsoft went wrong), then you really should &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;go read this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google tells employees it won’t raise everyone’s wages to keep up with inflation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FP6ocuot_mboi7QV0UpoREBwlWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256811/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company won’t be doing a company-wide pay raise to match rising prices.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syF3q2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet announced&lt;/a&gt; its fifth quarter in a row of record profits ($18.9 billion) and second straight quarter of record revenue ($65.1 billion) in October, but a company executive told employees that Google wouldn’t automatically adjust their salaries to account for inflation. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/google-execs-tell-employees-they-wont-raise-pay-to-match-inflation.html"&gt;According to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s VP of compensation Frank Wagner told employees at a company all-hands meeting on December 7th that Google doesn’t “have any plans to do any type of across-the-board type adjustment” when asked about the &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-consumer-price-index-for-november-11639142278"&gt;inflation rate in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWkJwm"&gt;Wagner did hint that the company’s compensation budgets “reflected” the higher cost of labor that comes with increased prices, according to CNBC. However, he said that the company would rather pay any increased wages based on performance rather than do an increase across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZnzjKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says it would rather adjust pay by performance than give “smaller increments to everybody”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcAvSk"&gt;While rewarding the top-performing employees more makes intuitive sense, it could also end up reinforcing people’s rankings — having to worry less about money means you can concentrate more on your work and even afford better quality time off to recharge. That rings especially true as &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;Google expects 80 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; to spend at least some time in its offices (often &lt;a href="https://about.google/locations/?region=north-america&amp;amp;office=mountain-view"&gt;located in cities&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080916/top-10-most-expensive-cities-us.asp"&gt;higher-than-average costs of living&lt;/a&gt; like Austin, New York, or San Francisco) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;when they end up returning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGRrPf"&gt;Google declined to provide an on-the-record comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told CNBC that base salary is just one part of its employees’ compensation, which also includes bonuses and stock. CNBC says the company also reiterated Wagner’s comments about pay increases being tied to performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My quest to find the ‘alligator brides’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4wz5r1dcGzgNg36XncrnX0pq6g=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256745/alligator_bride__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6kz0s7"&gt;Last night’s Game Awards had some really cool surprises. We got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827225/alan-wake-2-confirmed-trailer-release-date"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;announcement, we got the slit scared out of us by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EyUGYL9aSww"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slitterhead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and an adorable pot friend (like an actual friend in a pot, not a cannabis companion) &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K_03kFqWfqs"&gt;dropped some &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; lore&lt;/a&gt; on us. But there was one surprise that left me and my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confused, curious, and breathless for more: what game has alligator brides in it and how can we get our hands on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGv0x"&gt;Ming-Na Wen, savior of China and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700329/disney-plus-the-book-of-boba-fett-star-wars-release-date"&gt;Boba Fett’s right hand&lt;/a&gt;, appeared during the Game Awards to present the award for Best Narrative (which, by the way, went to the very well-deserving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). During her speech, she mentioned that as the mother of a gaming-obsessed kid, she enjoys when games are more than just, “blowing up grenade factories and yelling obscenities at your alligator brides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hk7TLw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;GRENADE FACTORIES AND ALLIGATOR BRIDES &lt;a href="https://t.co/VjPhGS55JC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VjPhGS55JC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mysterious Z   (READ STAR SOLDIER ZACKARACK T2D1) (@kel_roth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kel_roth/status/1469317759586738182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEhZgE"&gt;At her mention of “alligator brides,” everyone paused, took a moment to assess if that was truly what she said, and then wracked their brains to figure out just what the hell she was talking about. After turning on captions and running the video back, Wen did in fact say “alligator brides,” so it wasn’t a misunderstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvhXucJS9GUZTo9MFluA8K0n7tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079781/Screenshot_2021_12_10_153229.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’d be forgiven for thinking this is just YouTube’s caption service being its normal weird self, but she actually said “alligator brides.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zqj0mp"&gt;I asked my colleagues what game could she be talking about, but nobody could think of anything. Dieter Bohn did find &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; “Alligator Bride” in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/04/599400803/songs-we-love-howlin-rain-alligator-bride"&gt;a song by blues-rock band Howlin’ Rain&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but I don’t think these folks were &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;saurian spouses to which Wen was referring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOSbmv"&gt;On Twitter, people were just as enthusiastic about the idea of alligator brides as we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I want the video game about blowing up grenade factories and shouting obscenities at alligator brides. Give me this game. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Brown  ❄️ (@Toadsanime) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1469131694393470980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RnhAk"&gt;Still, with no information on this elusive game forthcoming, I decided to go to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo4NlF"&gt;I asked Ms. Wen herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IoxVTr"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MingNa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MingNa&lt;/a&gt; Hi! My name is Ash and I'm a video game reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;As me and my colleagues watched your presentation during the game awards, we were really curious when you mentioned your son yelling obscenities at his alligator brides. What game was that? We want to play too!&lt;/p&gt;— Ash Parrish (@adashtra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adashtra/status/1469345193425969152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeN2eE"&gt;I even decided to tap subject matter expert &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GatorsDaily"&gt;@GatorsDaily&lt;/a&gt; to see what they might know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjoih2"&gt;I haven’t gotten a response from either yet. But the more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that this “alligator brides” game isn’t some obscure indie title in which you’re presented with a roster of sentient, sexy, anthropomorphized reptiles to date, woo, and eventually marry (although that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game I would play) but something far more mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDh4y6"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;Skyrim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDx6Q6"&gt;Y’know, that Bethesda RPG that released &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/1789"&gt;100 years ago&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633130/skyrim-next-gen-upgrade-update-anniversary-special-edition-bethesda"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Su4Zv6"&gt;Or if not &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; specifically, one of the other &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;To the uninitiated, the &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; universe is populated by humans, cat-folk, and a race of upright reptilian peoples called Argonians. &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; games let you marry these humans, cat-folk, and upright reptilian Argonians. As the mystery of alligator brides continues, my best guess is that Wen’s son is an avid &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; player and lover of a &lt;a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lusty_Argonian_Maid"&gt;lusty Argonian maid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKjzOo"&gt;If this is in fact true, I hope that we as a community adopt the practice of calling &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; the “alligator bride” game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo will sell you the Switch OLED’s dock with built-in ethernet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bn7gz4Dz1w0cPL1WqUpAl5BNxTQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256611/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now get the Switch OLED dock without the Switch OLED&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHwZYN"&gt;If you’ve wanted to get your hands on the Nintendo Switch OLED’s dock, you’re in luck — Nintendo is now &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-oled-model-white.html"&gt;selling it on its online store for $70&lt;/a&gt;, $10 more than &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock.html"&gt;the original dock&lt;/a&gt;. The newer version of the dock has a slightly more rounded design, comes in white, and (most importantly for some gamers) &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55834/~/nintendo-switch-%E2%80%93-oled-model-overview-and-faq#s2q1"&gt;trades one of its USB 2.0 ports&lt;/a&gt; for an ethernet jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjbsBB"&gt;It’s nice to have the option to buy a second dock for your Switch OLED, should you need an extra or a replacement. You could also pick one up if you’ve got a non-OLED Switch and your dock is getting to the point where it needs a replacement. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/faq/"&gt;Nintendo’s own FAQ says&lt;/a&gt; the OLED’s dock is compatible with the regular Switch, though you may need to do a software update to get full functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gB2y74"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want LAN, this is probably the dock to get&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3GkR1"&gt;If you’re in need of a dock and you were planning on adding a LAN port anyway, going with the OLED dock seems like a no-brainer. Nintendo &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/wired-internet-lan-adapter.html"&gt;sells its first-party ethernet adapter&lt;/a&gt; for $30 on its own, and while you can find ones &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083ZLPJMW/ref=emc_b_5_t?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;around the $10 mark&lt;/a&gt;, having an integrated one is certainly a cleaner solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlG7U3"&gt;If you need a dock and are looking to save a buck, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-refurbished.html"&gt;refurbished original model&lt;/a&gt; for a cool $40. Nintendo also sells a refurb of &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-animal-crossing-refurbished-card.html"&gt;the Animal Crossing-themed dock&lt;/a&gt; for the same price if you’re feeling in the island mood. While these won’t include the LAN port, they are still compatible with the Switch OLED if you’re looking to pick up an extra dock for a secondary TV and don’t want to splurge on the version that came in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Extremely bad’ vulnerability found in widely used logging system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ABUgFuk3c-LaqDF9AH6d0Qa2JA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256587/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wjC5m2"&gt;Security teams at companies large and small are scrambling to patch a previously unknown vulnerability called Log4Shell, which has the potential to let hackers compromise millions of devices across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoWHXK"&gt;If exploited, the vulnerability allows remote code execution on vulnerable servers, giving an attacker the ability to import malware that would completely compromise machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xo2XhJ"&gt;The vulnerability is found in log4j, an open-source logging library used by apps and services across the internet. Logging is a process where applications keep a running list of activities they have performed which can later be reviewed in case of error. Nearly every network security system runs some kind of logging process, which gives popular libraries like log4j an enormous reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t91xx5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When I look back over the last 10 years, there are only two other exploits I can think of with a similar severity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BpiHi4"&gt;Marcus Hutchins, a prominent security researcher best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/13/15635050/wannacry-ransomware-kill-switch-protect-nhs-attack"&gt;halting the global WannaCry malware attack&lt;/a&gt;, noted online that millions of applications would be affected. “Millions of applications use Log4j for logging, and all the attacker needs to do is get the app to log a special string,” Hutchins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDGiX1"&gt;The exploit was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/"&gt;first seen on sites hosting &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; servers&lt;/a&gt;, which discovered that attackers could trigger the vulnerability by posting chat messages. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469326260803416073"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from security analysis company GreyNoise reported that the company has already detected numerous servers searching the internet for machines vulnerable to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQgc9p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from application security company LunaSec claimed that gaming platform Steam and Apple’s iCloud had already been found to be vulnerable. Neither Valve nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l9FSp"&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker has to cause the application to save a special string of characters in the log. Since applications routinely log a wide range of events — such as messages sent and received by users, or the details of system errors — the vulnerability is unusually easy to exploit and can be triggered in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX0x16"&gt;“This is a very serious vulnerability because of the widespread use of Java and this package log4j,” Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s a tremendous amount of Java software connected to the internet and in back-end systems. When I look back over the last 10 years, there are only two other exploits I can think of with a similar severity: Heartbleed, which allowed you to get information from servers that should have been secure, and Shellshock, which allowed you to run code on a remote machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKPyu"&gt;However, the diversity of applications vulnerable to the exploit, and range of possible delivery mechanisms, mean that firewall protection alone does not eliminate risk. Theoretically, the exploit could even be carried out physically by hiding the attack string in a QR code that was scanned by a package delivery company, making its way into the system without having been sent directly over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="payGPR"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"&gt;update to the log4j library&lt;/a&gt; has already been released to mitigate against the vulnerability, but given the time taken to ensure that all vulnerable machines are updated, Log4Shell remains a pressing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly delays Explorer EV in favor of Mustang Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KVBazmUGUSY0I5LLn_mf7vsP43w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256548/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnUiXK"&gt;Ford is delaying the launch of its forthcoming all-electric Explorer SUV from mid-2023 to at least December 2024, according to &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-delays-explorer-aviator-evs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The rollout of an all-electric Lincoln Aviator built on the same shared Ford EV platform is also being delayed along that same timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHkNhI"&gt;Ford also no longer plans to build the two EVs at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, where it makes the Mustang Mach-E, according to the report. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;confirmed the vehicles in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJFsKD"&gt;Emma Bergg, Ford’s director of EV communications, declined to confirm the delay but said that Ford now plans to use the entire plant in Cuautitlan for Mach-E production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9Pplj"&gt;“We have unprecedented demand for Mustang Mach-E and we are going to scale production quickly to meet demand. We are now planning to utilize the entire Cuautitlan plant for production of Mach-E,” Bergg wrote in an email. She added that Ford now plans to make as many as 200,000 Mach-Es per year by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YAim7"&gt;The delay means that it now may be a &lt;em&gt;while &lt;/em&gt;before there’s a third electric vehicle in Ford’s North American lineup, following the Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning. CEO Jim Farley has hinted at all-electric versions of &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/506699/ford-farley-hint-bronco-ev/"&gt;the new Bronco SUV and Maverick compact pickup&lt;/a&gt;, though the company hasn’t said when those would be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HTdqN"&gt;Ford’s EV ambitions haven’t dampened, though. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826469/ford-f150-lightning-ev-deposits-reservations-closed"&gt;ramped up the number of F-150 Lightnings it plans to make&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years. It’s also hiring extra workers to handle the demand for the electric pickup truck. The automaker has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-in-2023.html"&gt;make 600,000 EVs worldwide by 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VWltX"&gt;“Our goal is to become the clear No. 2 electric vehicle maker in North America within the next couple years and then challenge for No. 1,” Bergg wrote in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI2iap"&gt;Ford’s Explorer SUV is one of its most popular vehicles outside of the F-Series lineup of trucks. The Explorer is also one of the driving forces of the company’s dominance in the police and security vehicle market. With the Biden administration incentivizing government fleets to go electric, that means Ford may have to focus on introducing pursuit-rated versions of its other EVs while the Explorer waits in the wings. And, in fact, it’s already doing this — the &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/24/tough-enough-for-law-enforcement-mustang-mach-e.html"&gt;Mustang Mach-E passed Michigan state police tests in September&lt;/a&gt; and will get &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/12/ford-mustang-mach-e-to-join-dhs-as-part-of-field-testing-operation/"&gt;tested by the Department of Homeland Security in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2YE4Y"&gt;Lincoln is &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/future-product/ford-lincoln-ready-new-midsize-ev-crossovers"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be working on electric versions of the smaller Nautilus and Corsair EVs that could hit the market before the delayed Aviator. Lincoln previously canceled an EV it was co-developing with Rivian in 2020. Ford, which owns roughly 12 percent of Rivian, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791984/ford-rivian-ev-canceled-investment-ipo-jim-farley"&gt;also dropped a project with the EV startup&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKoKXR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story previously stated Ford was working on a mid-size electric SUV similar to the Edge based on a 2019 report, but that vehicle wound up being the Explorer EV. We’ve removed the reference to the Edge and regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision exec asks employees to ‘consider the consequences’ of unionizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard Employees Hold Walkout In Support Of Labor Lawsuit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjWU7xZP7V7VePID0pOcP98N4pc=/0x0:8660x5773/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256486/1234272416.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3GGvi"&gt;Brian Bulatao, former Trump admin and current chief administrative officer for Activision Blizzard, sent a letter to his colleagues that doesn’t outright discourage them from unionizing but also kind of discourages them from unionizing. The letter was sent after workers engaged in their fifth straight day of work stoppage in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;layoffs at Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;creation of a strike-fund&lt;/a&gt; to support those who walked out; and employees collaborating with the Communications Workers of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLulcx"&gt;The letter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1469355855707475970"&gt;shared on Twitter by Jessica Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, reaffirms in bold letters that Activision supports workers’ right to choose whether to join a union (as interference with unionizing is a violation of federal law). But, through carefully worded phrases, the letter also seems to discourage those same efforts by implying a union would impede progress by interfering in the direct communication between employees and management, a common anti-union talking point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUGumr"&gt;“We believe that direct dialogue between management and employees is essential to the success of Activision Blizzard,” Bulatao wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP7tq3"&gt;Direct dialogue like when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;over 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove Bobby Kotick as CEO while the board of directors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;continued to essentially respond, “No.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k27k22"&gt;Direct dialogue like when breastfeeding workers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468712916245368835?s=20"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; for years about the substandard conditions of their pumping rooms &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468712965398405123?s=20"&gt;including having breastmilk stolen from their special fridges&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468713229320740866?s=20"&gt;HR allegedly not doing enough to address those complaints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phxi8j"&gt;Y’know, that kind of direct dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cglelS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We believe that direct dialogue between management and employees is essential to the success of Activision Blizzard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIhCHw"&gt;But according to Bulatao, the best way forward is “transparent dialogue between leaders and employees that we can act upon quickly.” As though the abuses the company is accused of didn’t occur over the course of years with some of the biggest offenders only being let &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;go as recently as 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnr7rd"&gt;The letter also attempts to warn employees off unions by characterizing them as faceless third parties to whom employees would consign away their rights without hope of input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="704V4s"&gt;“As you make this decision, we ask only that you take time to consider the consequence of your signature on the binding legal document presented to you by the CWA. [...] that means your ability to negotiate all your own working conditions will be turned over to the CWA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz6eYt"&gt;It’s true that unions are legal intercessors between employer and employee, but the “collective” in “collective bargaining unit” has always been composed of current employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5wvol"&gt;In addition to Bulatao’s letter, Julie Hodges, Activision Blizzard’s chief people officer, issued her own statement to managers about how to respond to questions they might be getting about unionization and training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NjEw1"&gt;Activision Blizzard did not respond in time for comment. The CWA criticized these anti-union adjacent tactics in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saying, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PN92VW"&gt;“Instead of responding to their workers’ concerns, they’ve opted to blast the most tired anti-union talking points straight from the union busting script. Union avoidance campaigns waste resources that ABK management could otherwise be using to address the serious concerns at the company such as compensating the victims of sexual harassment and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wEZ1fT"&gt;Activision Blizzard hasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html"&gt;gone full Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in its attempts to stop employees from unionizing. Bulatao’s letter said if Activision Blizzard fails to turn the company around, unionization would always be an option. But the letter gave no timeline of when such progress would be made. And as Activision Blizzard continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798473/activision-blizzard-board-of-directors-new-committee"&gt;create new committees&lt;/a&gt; and lean on “direct and transparent dialogue” that can be acted upon “quickly” to solve problems, employees like Christine — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823991/activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-victim-press-conference"&gt;who gave a press conference&lt;/a&gt; outlining how she was harassed and then retaliated against for reporting her harassment — continue to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXnIH7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Od1Ki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNnljk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton really wants you to know that what happened to Big isn’t because of its bike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkRYKZVuPbDEJ9vcXU8iyA6CLzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256287/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Peloton Bike was at the center of a shocking plot twist in HBO’s Sex and the City reboot.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5Wfps"&gt;The punches keep coming for Peloton. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;treadmills were recalled&lt;/a&gt; after a series of injuries and a child’s death, people are returning to gyms, and now — spoiler alert — its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;stock is down 11 percent overnight&lt;/a&gt; after its iconic Bike was a key part of a major character’s death in the inaugural episode of &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/em&gt;, HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;reboot. However, Peloton is now saying its product isn’t to blame — it’s extravagant living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe118I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler warning: the following discusses a major plot point from the first episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLr6pV"&gt;The brouhaha centers around the death of Mr. Big (Chris Noth) following a 45-minute Peloton class led by fictional instructor Allegra (who is portrayed by actual Peloton instructor Jess King). Peloton has been quick to downplay the role its popular stationary bike played in Big’s demise. Instead, the company is pointing the finger at the character’s lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFyPLw"&gt;“I’m sure ‘SATC’ fans, like me, are saddened by the news that Mr. Big dies of a heart attack. Mr. Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle — including cocktails, cigars, and big steaks — and was at serious risk as he had a previous cardiac event in Season 6. These lifestyle choices and perhaps even his family history, which often is a significant factor, were the likely cause of his death. Riding his Peloton Bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event,” Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist who also serves on Peloton’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/peloton-health-wellness-advisory-council/"&gt;health and wellness advisory council&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpHpF"&gt;“More than 80 percent of all cardiac-related deaths are preventable through lifestyle, diet and exercise modifications. And while 25 percent of heart attacks each year are in patients who already had one (like Mr. Big), even then they are very, very treatable,” Steinbaum said. She also noted that Peloton helps track heart rate — though you need a compatible heart rate monitor for that — to help riders exercise safely. Or, it’s &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; Mr. Big’s own fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jWQnQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unlikely that a fictional character’s death will be what does Peloton in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WqTjI"&gt;Never mind the fact that Mr. Big is fictional — the product placement seemed odd given the jarring storyline. Companies generally have stipulations regarding how their products appear. Apple is notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/26/21154151/apple-bad-guys-movies-iphones-product-placement"&gt;not allowing TV and movie villains to use their products&lt;/a&gt;. However, Peloton told &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/peloton-big-just-like-that-hbo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while it had approved King’s appearance in the show, it wasn’t aware of the overall plotline for confidentiality reasons. Peloton spokesperson Denise Kelly also clarified that HBO had bought its own Peloton Bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ezm4t"&gt;While SATC fans are &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a38474592/and-just-like-that-big-death-reactions/"&gt;reeling&lt;/a&gt; over Big’s death, and Peloton will likely spend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijof8uw4OHs"&gt;another holiday season as meme fodder&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not yet clear how much of an impact a fictional character’s death will have on the company’s long-term fortunes. The company was one of the biggest &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-smartwatches-workout-apps-and-connected-bikes-dom-1845926648"&gt;success stories of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but that perception has begun to shift now that gyms are reopening. Despite slashing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;cost of its original Bike&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton reported less-than-stellar earnings in November. Peloton’s stock plummeted 35 percent following the announcement, and the company also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/peloton-freezes-hiring-after-it-slashes-its-forecast-shares-drop-35percent.html"&gt;froze hiring across all its departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Maa1PD"&gt;That said, if there’s one thing about Peloton fans, it’s that they’re incredibly loyal. The company boasts &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee"&gt;a 92 percent yearly retention rate&lt;/a&gt;. A child’s death, several injuries, and a recall &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-recalls-treadmill-death-injuries-members-will-not-return-2021-5"&gt;were not enough to convince Tread Plus owners to return their machines&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unlikely that in the long run, a fictional character’s death will be what does Peloton in. However, the next few months will hint at what Peloton’s place is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;in the future of connected fitness&lt;/a&gt; — and whether it’s still the leader of the pack. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is BTS’s Twitter world, and we are living in it</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVF86B"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1351897267666608129"&gt;most-liked tweet of 2021&lt;/a&gt; was a note from Joe Biden on the day of his inauguration. The fourth and fifth most-liked tweets are messages from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1351903613237547010"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1351938078643003393"&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, also celebrating Biden’s inauguration. In second place, sandwiched right in there with 3.2 million likes, is a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1353536893787357184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1353536893787357184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soompi.com%2Farticle%2F1503037wpp%2Ftwitter-reveals-btss-stopasianhate-tweet-was-most-retweeted-tweet-of-2021"&gt;photo of BTS member Jungkook&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a bed and making a kissy face at the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9oRlu"&gt;Such is the absolute chokehold that the South Korean band held over global social media in 2021. Twitter has detailed its top tweets, emojis, and hashtags of 2021 in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/2021--onlyontwitter"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and the running theme is clear: BTS ruled the platform. The members, who tweet from a single group account rather than individual handles, receive multiple millions of likes on almost everything they post. Their selfies are &lt;a href="https://www.iwmbuzz.com/music/celebrities-music/7-times-bts-kim-taehyung-and-park-jimin-broke-the-internet-with-their-crazy-selfie-looks/2021/10/10"&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/02/btss-jimin-breaks-the-internet-once-again-after-posting-an-eye-catching-selfie"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelist.com/319552/bts-jungkook-reveals-a-brand-new-look-thats-turning-heads/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-besides-his-blonde-hair-jungkooks-bed-new-selca-caught-armys-attention-hilarious-reason-600265"&gt; “breaking the internet”&lt;/a&gt; and often cause their names to trend worldwide. #BTS, Twitter announced, was the top hashtag of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQtr1d"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/Jz9icVF68w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jz9icVF68w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 방탄소년단 (@BTS_twt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1353536893787357184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9Ug39"&gt;The band is also responsible for the most-retweeted tweet of the year, which was a screenshotted statement condemning violence against Asians and Asian Americans. In the tweet, which followed a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/nyregion/asian-hate-crimes.html"&gt;rise in anti-Asian hate crimes&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the members recalled their own encounters with racism and discrimination while also noting that “[our] own experiences are inconsequential compared to the events that have occurred over the past few weeks.” The tweet has received 1 million retweets and 2.5 million likes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1drJrs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopAsianHate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopAsianHate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopAAPIHate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopAAPIHate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOmttkOpOt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mOmttkOpOt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 방탄소년단 (@BTS_twt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1376712834269159425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt05fW"&gt;Third on the retweet ladder was Billboard’s August 2nd announcement that the group’s single Butter (currently nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category) had &lt;a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1481985wpp/btss-butter-overtakes-olivia-rodrigos-record-on-billboards-hot-100-for-longest-running-no-1-song-of-2021"&gt;spent the longest period&lt;/a&gt; of time as number 1 on the Hot 100 chart in 2021, with 1.3 million retweets. (Second place was a tweet from Manchester United welcoming Cristiano Ronaldo to the team.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmrCmk"&gt;Twitter is hardly the only social media platform where BTS is topping lists. Band member V created his own Instagram handle just a few days ago and has reportedly become the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WORLDMUSICAWARD/status/1467863617697722375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467863617697722375%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news18.com%2Fnews%2Fmovies%2Fbts-star-v-joins-instagram-breaks-records-and-becomes-fastest-to-score-10-million-followers-4527611.html"&gt;fastest user in history&lt;/a&gt; to reach 10 million followers. The group also snatched &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2021/9/bts-and-their-23-records-enter-the-guinness-world-records-2022-hall-of-fame"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; this year for most retweets on average, most viewed YouTube music video premiere, and fastest TikTok account to reach 1 million followers (among countless others). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVV48R"&gt;One thing is clear from all this: BTS — not just their publicists and social media managers, but the seven members themselves — are an online force of nature. They’ve mastered the internet. And in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359080/anti-asian-racism-attacks-surveillance-policing"&gt;a year &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;that’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393622/asian-hate-crime-reporting-community-group-statistics"&gt;been incredibly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447553/anti-asian-american-hate-story-aapi-belong"&gt;painful and frustrating&lt;/a&gt; for many Asians and Asian Americans to watch unfold, it’s hard not to see each record-smashing post — whether a fiery political statement or a silly selfie — as a small comfort. This is a group that loudly condemns racism. It’s also a group that sings and tweets and comments in Korean. It’s a group that is Asian on the internet — unapologetic, kissy-faced, rising above it all, victorious. BTS isn’t going anywhere, and neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;
