    <title>Nikon’s Z FC is a film camera revival in mirrorless form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gUF5w0d2VNqtK1-vbm6_hfPqyU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517035/Zfc_USDD_TO_6573.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRJpV4"&gt;Nikon is going all-in on the retro aesthetic with its latest Z-series mirrorless camera. The company says the new Z FC, officially styled “Z fc,” is designed specifically to evoke its FM2 film SLR from the ‘80s, with dedicated dials for settings like shutter speed, exposure compensation, and ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PNUbN"&gt;The approach is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5066118/nikon-df-full-frame-modern-camera-in-a-stunning-old-school-body"&gt;the Nikon DF&lt;/a&gt;, a retro-style full-frame DSLR that Nikon released in 2013. But the DF was much larger than the film cameras it was inspired by. The Z FC has a 20.9-megapixel APS-C sensor (and of course no SLR mirror and prism), which means the resulting camera is far more compact and looks a lot closer to something like an FM2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lO7JdRdm2y6a5c7WyqTK4KS-to=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688024/Zfc_16_50DX_3.5_6.3_top.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6e6zGf"&gt;Beyond the exterior, the Z FC is a modern camera with broadly similar specs to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20906990/nikon-z50-camera-announced-mirrorless-z-mount-instagram"&gt;the Z50&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a vari-angle touchscreen, an OLED electronic viewfinder, USB-C charging, SnapBridge wireless connectivity, and of course the now-requisite ability to use it as a webcam. While the camera can be shot in fully manual mode with the dials, there’s also a switch for PASM operation, and you can check aperture settings with a tiny LCD on the top plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KtyhE"&gt;The native ISO range is 100-51,200 and there’s a hybrid AF system with 209 points across 87 percent of the frame. Video isn’t really a focus with the Z FC, unsurprisingly, but it can shoot at up to 4K/30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUUb9N4Yh5WSWl8wWq4rSxFOKSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688022/Cool_PBS_C.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThVUsw"&gt;As a Z-mount camera, the Z FC will be able to use any of the full-frame lenses that are native to cameras like the Z6 and Z7, but Nikon’s lineup of DX/APS-C lenses that can make the most of the Z FC’s small size is still lacking. Nikon is announcing one new prime lens today, however — a 28mm (42mm equivalent) f/2.8 that’ll be available in a special edition with styling that makes it look like an older Nikkor D lens. Nikon will also release a silver version of its 16-50mm pancake zoom alongside the Z FC, and says a DX 18-140mm travel zoom will be available at some point this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKpgWB"&gt;The ZFC will cost $959.95 body-only, $1,099.95 with the silver 16-50mm lens, and $1,199.95 with the 28mm lens. All three options will be released in black and silver late July. Nikon is also releasing six extra color options that’ll be sold solely through its own site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykPx3ueDbkJ8yoPl_dRPYl-kgYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688021/Q1985_Color_Cams.jpg"&gt;

    <title>LG’s C1 and G1 OLEDs get even better at gaming with 120Hz Dolby Vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLK4LBuGcWwQxp8qwUre5aomD9Y=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516674/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Drqel1"&gt;With Dolby Vision gaming HDR technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;available on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles&lt;/a&gt;, some TV owners have noticed that suddenly there’s a new setting to worry over. While some HDMI 2.1-equipped 4K displays could handle 120Hz, and some can support Dolby Vision for gaming, at first there weren’t any that could do both things at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HalHt3"&gt;Now LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s the first manufacturer with Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz support on some of its TVs, just a couple of weeks after owners noticed it arriving in updates. The 03.15.27 firmware enables the feature on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;C1 and G1 2021 OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today LG says support is on the way for other premium TVs in its 2021 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ElcdBW"&gt;Additional premium models in LG’s 2021 TV lineup such as OLED Z1 series, QNED Mini LED QNED99 series and NanoCell NANO99 series TVs will also receive the update in July. Additional 2021 and 2020 TV models are also being tested for Dolby Vision gaming in either 60Hz or 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cm7Kv"&gt;The press release wasn’t specific about support for previous years, but the company has said to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2021/06/21/lg-reveals-more-on-its-new-dolby-vision-gaming-oled-tv-updateincluding-wider-model-support/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that beta software with 4K/120Hz support is coming to other 4K TVs including last year’s CX and BX models. There’s no word yet on any update for 2019 OLED TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgRBsd"&gt;All of this is happening before the first Dolby Vision HDR-enabled games are available, which we believe should help gamers automatically configure their brightness and image settings to match the TV’s capabilities. As the company behind the technology &lt;a href="https://www.dolby.com/gaming/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, “Dolby Vision games automatically map to your Dolby Vision display as you play, so you’re always seeing the full picture.” Microsoft has said it means you’ll see “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors,” although how that applies to other HDR games is harder to tell. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaewRAS4wI5X2uxclq86vwjQeHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687780/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_03a.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TP8C2y"&gt;The new firmware also adds Game Dashboard, a floating menu that should help LG owners configure their TVs and see which settings are enabled. It works on any 2021 LG TV with Game Optimizer, and can show the status of the TV’s black stabilizer, low latency and variable refresh rate (VRR), or flip between settings tuned for specific genres. Samsung was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;with a game bar feature on its 2021 TVs&lt;/a&gt;, but with something this useful we hope more manufacturers pick up the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler reportedly refused to ban Trump’s critics as part of discussions to bring him onboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler’s logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-GBIF930tf6N5o4IiBD58dPoE4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516611/1230591653.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRJCDl"&gt;The alternative social network Parler and representatives of former president Donald Trump were reportedly considering an idea to make Trump an active member of the platform after he left office, but Parler apparently pushed back on one key part of the proposed arrangement: the platform did not want to ban Trump’s detractors, according to an excerpt of Michael Wolff’s upcoming book about the last days of Trump’s presidency &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-landslide-final-days-trump-presidency-excerpt.html"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YuR1w"&gt;Here’s what was going on, according to Wolff: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JZio80"&gt;One curious point of consideration for the [Trump] family [the morning of January 6th] — prescient of the events that would shortly unfold — was a follow-up to a discussion initiated some months before by aides and family. Trump representatives, working with Trump-family members, had approached Parler, the social network backed by Bob Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, far-right exponents and large Trump contributors. They had floated a proposition that Trump, after he left office, become an active member of Parler, moving much of his social-media activity there from Twitter. In return, Trump would receive 40 percent of Parler’s gross revenues and the service would ban anyone who spoke negatively about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLj9SB"&gt;Parler was balking only at this last condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4eqrLO"&gt;Parler, which has been popular with conservative users, has long promoted itself as a social network that isn’t moderated as tightly as other platforms, so it’s not entirely surprising that it didn’t want to lay down a red line on content, even at the request of its most famous potential user. The company has not replied to a request for comment about the reported discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gINUrP"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-parler-ownership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; also reported on the conversations&lt;/a&gt; about Trump’s potential increased involvement with Parler, but shared different proposed terms — “Parler offered the Trump Organization a 40% stake in the company,” according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; — and did not report on Parler’s apparent refusal to ban Trump critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiG8on"&gt;Shortly after the January 6th attack on the US Capitol, Parler was banned by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; from their respective app stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon terminated Parler’s hosting&lt;/a&gt;. The app returned to Apple’s App Store in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440005/parler-apple-app-store-return-amazon-google-capitol"&gt;though it had some content excluded&lt;/a&gt;. It still isn’t available on Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juul settles with North Carolina in first teen vaping lawsuit </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHNsjcRoLv10d7ALmZnwNl7GNBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516503/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rSe6j"&gt;Juul has agreed to settle its first state lawsuit over deceptive business practices with North Carolina, a move that will limit the vaping company’s marketing claims and placement of products in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGlXC"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Juul will no longer use marketing strategies geared toward young people, including most social media marketing campaigns, advertising near schools, and sponsoring sporting events or concerts. The company also cannot use models under 35 years old for advertisements in the state, and it’s required that Juul products are sold behind the counters of stores, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252318958.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Juul will also pay a $40 million fine to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr6eM2"&gt;“North Carolina is now the first state in the nation to hold Juul accountable for its instrumental role in sparking the epidemic of youth vaping and its resulting nicotine addiction,” North Carolina attorney general Josh Stein &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a press statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SstqtQ"&gt;Juul will also send undercover teen agents to 1,000 stores each year to make sure Juul products aren’t being sold to those &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review/nc"&gt;under age 18&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb7uxG"&gt;“This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1XOIs"&gt;This is the first known lawsuit Juul has settled for its deceptive marketing practices, but it’s far from the last on the docket. The company faces similar lawsuits in at least nine other states, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/north-carolina-wins-40-million-settlement-in-juul-lawsuit.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and at least 100 schools have joined a &lt;a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/school-districts-are-suing-juul-over-youth-vaping-do-they-stand-a-chance/2020/02"&gt;national lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; to recoup costs associated with anti-vaping campaigns. Thirty-nine other states are also considering similar lawsuits to North Carolina’s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252420018.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG6Qb8"&gt;Juul stopped selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919415/juul-suspends-sale-fruity-flavor-pods-ecigarette"&gt;fruity flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; like mango in 2019 as part of an effort to head off these mounting lawsuits. The company ceased selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953865/juul-mint-flavor-discontinue-ban-fda-vaping-illness"&gt;mint-flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; shortly after. Under the North Carolina settlement, Juul cannot introduce new flavors or new levels of nicotine in the state without prior approval from the FDA. The FDA is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/23/democrats-slam-fda-crack-down-juul/"&gt;already reviewing&lt;/a&gt; whether Juul and other e-cigarette products can stay on the market beyond September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s new update fixes its crashing problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you’ve been experiencing the bug where the iOS version of Snapchat crashes at launch, it seems that there’s now an update to fix it available in the App Store. The bug that’s been fixed by the update didn’t appear to have affected the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;Before updating to the latest version, 11.34.1.35, the app would give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard on my iPhone 12 Mini. Now, I’m no longer getting the error, and have successfully been able to send a Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kodK5Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976"&gt;This is what the bug looked like&lt;/a&gt; when it was present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80qzZk"&gt;The Snapchat Support Twitter account hasn’t yet tweeted about the fix (despite &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;having a pinned tweet&lt;/a&gt; talking about the bug), but Snap’s SVP of Product &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacobandreou/status/1409640178352680960"&gt;has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the issue being fixed. Both myself and one of my co-workers tested the update, and it fixed the crashing issue for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkbbKz"&gt;If your phone isn’t automatically downloading the update, you can grab it yourself by going to the App Store, tapping on your profile picture in the top right corner, and pulling down to refresh. Any available updates should appear, and you can download them. If you turned off Auto-update to avoid the bugged version, you can turn it back on by going to Settings &amp;gt; App Store, and then toggling App Updates on under Automatic Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj8B3m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 7:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the issue appears to have been fixed by an update from Snapchat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Obs61"&gt;&lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/64-bit-office-for-windows-on-arm"&gt;Microsoft is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that the next version of Office for Windows 11 will have a native 64-bit Arm version, for improved performance on large or picture-filled documents, and support for 64-bit add-ins. The new version of Office is currently in beta, available to &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwI8im"&gt;Microsoft also announced &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/visual-refresh-of-office-apps-for-windows"&gt;a redesign of Office&lt;/a&gt;, which you can see above and below. While it uses a similar design to Windows 11, it’ll be available whether you're running the Windows 11 Preview or Windows 10. In addition to the new design, Office will also adapt to your Windows light / dark mode, so you should be able to avoid the experience of opening a document and having it blast light into your eyes at night. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newly-designed Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y47sBe"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t shied away from talking about Arm with Windows 11. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc"&gt;contentious list&lt;/a&gt; of supported CPUs &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-qualcomm-processors"&gt;includes a handful of Qualcomm chips&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8vO1inHBb8"&gt;used the Arm-powered Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; to show off the tablet capabilities of its new OS. For those with Arm machines, it’s probably a good sign — having native apps is likely going to be more efficient than emulation, and provide better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnR4gy"&gt;It is, however, perhaps a little awkward that it took so long for a 64-bit Arm version of Office to come to Windows — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;M1 Macs got a native version&lt;/a&gt; late last year. There are also a few features that Microsoft mentions haven't come to the Arm version of Office yet, though that’s to be expected given that it’s currently in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHPshL"&gt;In addition to being in the Office Insider program, those who want to test out 64-bit Office on their Arm Windows machine will also have to be running &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;the Windows 11 Insider Preview&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll also have to uninstall any 32-bit versions of Office they may have installed before reinstalling Office and updating to the beta version. If you’re running the Office beta on either Windows 10 or 11, you should be able to turn the redesign on from the Coming Soon pane in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoftBank has reportedly halted production of its Pepper robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pepper-softbank-robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa6HeT0Ma1wIiEoyx7r7HJet_JQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515973/DSC01589__1_.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hv8v9k"&gt;SoftBank is reportedly restructuring its robotics business and has already halted production of its Pepper robot, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Robotics is just one of many businesses the large Japanese firm has invested in, but potentially permanently ending production of Pepper is notable because of the robot’s role as a sort of unofficial mascot for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8npFxE"&gt;SoftBank plans to lay off 330 staff members based in France, the original home of SoftBank’s robotics efforts, and apparently half of the division’s sales team in the UK and the US, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes. Production of Pepper robots was reportedly halted last year and would be costly to restart, &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources claim. We’ve reached out to SoftBank to confirm the details of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOJY3h"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report follows closely after SoftBank’s sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics to Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly seems like the company is reconsidering what exactly it wants to do in the robot business. For now, that means less futuristic moonshot promises and more practical business-type offerings, like &lt;a href="https://us.softbankrobotics.com/whiz"&gt;a carpet-cleaning robot called Whiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRz8d4"&gt;Pepper was initially pitched as a robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;that could understand human emotion&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced and hasn’t become any more true, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726082/softbank-pepper-ibm-watson-collaboration"&gt;an assist from IBM’s Watson&lt;/a&gt;. SoftBank then pushed its friendly bot into all sorts of odd, if charming scenarios, like working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;as a Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt;, playing docent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/24/17277350/softbank-pepper-the-robot-smithsonian-museum"&gt;at the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, and staffing the company’s stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hJBwGf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A3ZLLGuvQY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=82&amp;amp;start=82" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxYQXo"&gt;Pepper might not have ever lived up to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3ZLLGuvQY&amp;amp;t=82s"&gt;the ads used to sell it&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, but it could be charming. My interactions with the waist-high android are limited, but after hearing about Pepper a lot online, seeing the real deal was kind of a capital-E experience. I had wandered into a crowded SoftBank store in Tokyo and was greeted by Pepper in Japanese with a friendly smile and a little wave. On paper, traditional robot stuff. But in the moment? I would have at least considered whatever prepaid phone plan Pepper was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube wins naming rights for 6,000-seat event venue at Hollywood Park</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD_Ug9S_6q5slF7NqLPqmzwHsOk=/225x0:1635x940/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515360/youtube_theater_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Theater | YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VUAXLp"&gt;Google-owned YouTube will have its name on a new live event venue in Inglewood, California, part of the new Hollywood Park mixed-use development, the &lt;a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/youtube-partners-with-partners-hollywood-park-to-name-performance-venue-youtube-theater/"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube Theater will be a 6,000-seat performance venue, which will host concerts, comedy shows, YouTube creator events, esports competitions, and community shows. Financial terms of the multiyear naming rights deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VqNbr"&gt;The development is the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and part of the same complex as SoFi Stadium — where the Rams and Chargers play — and American Airlines Plaza. Hollywood Park also houses 3,000 apartments, a 300-room hotel, and an 890,000 square-foot retail area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oe7srF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH9RsPGyVzs?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=6&amp;amp;start=6" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVZEy"&gt;“YouTube Theater will drive the uniqueness of YouTube by combining physical, ‘in real life’ events that bring creators and fans together, while simultaneously sharing ​that same event​ experience with our two billion global monthly users through livestreams and VOD content,” YouTube vice president of brand marketing Angela Courtin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sySMu2"&gt;Upcoming performers at the three-story, 227,000-square foot YouTube Theater include Pitbull and Iggy Azalea, Black Pumas, and TLC with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The venue also has a 6,100-square-foot stage and a 3,500-square-foot private club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL9kjG"&gt;The theater will have a large-scale digital YouTube “play” button icon outside the venue, which can turn into an immersive video screen where guests can mirror themselves or view highlights from YouTube creators and artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUo4Gk"&gt;YouTube Theater is set to open for its first events later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMC2y4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AdBlock glitch blanks out content on Twitter, Wikipedia, Amazon, and other sites</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3AgNp"&gt;If the internet has looked a little empty to you over the last day or so, check to see if your browser is using AdBlock or Adblock Plus. &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=82553"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1409495451418640388"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1409507225094209540"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt;, ad blockers have inadvertently wiped out the content they’re looking for on a number of mainstream sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKZVkh"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what caused the problem, but the issue should either resolve itself or it can be fixed by going into settings and requesting an update for your filter lists. In an email, the Adblock Plus support channel confirmed the problem “has already been fixed” without going in depth about what it was. Several &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/o9hfbg/issue_on_many_website_since_a_few_days/h3c49d4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posts on social media&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/commit/9a35decd7429737af9c814bf16cf30caed8f939"&gt;recent change in filtering&lt;/a&gt; that works in other blockers but was interpreted by Adblock Plus to block content tagged as “media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc09Cg"&gt;There’s no public statement available from the Adblock Plus social channels or owners eyeo GmbH, but at least the problem was only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited offers six months of Disney Plus for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1rt2Ej7ZfbLHGeIa4ly9ExSfaU=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515302/download.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1Y4Uh"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited customers can now score several months of Disney Plus for free, and the offer extends to new subscribers as well as existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0YPF"&gt;Amazon announced Monday that existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers in the US and Canada can activate three months of Disney’s streaming service for free through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion"&gt;a new promotion&lt;/a&gt;. New Amazon Music Subscribers, meanwhile, will be able to access six months of Disney Plus through the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0t2Ym"&gt;Amazon’s ad-free music streaming service costs $8 a month or $80 annually after a trial period. It is separate from Prime Music, the music service bundled with an Amazon Prime subscription. But where Prime Music has a catalog of roughly 2 million songs, Amazon Music Unlimited’s library comprises roughly 75 million songs and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAk6dq"&gt;The promotion is not, however, valid for users who already subscribe to Disney Plus. But if you’ve yet to subscribe to Disney’s streaming service, now’s not a bad time. New titles are releasing on the service every week, and the company has said that users can expect 100 new titles from Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and National Geographic to hit the service each year. &lt;/p&gt;
