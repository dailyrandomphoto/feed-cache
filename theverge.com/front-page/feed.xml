    <title>Pixel phones will be able to read your heart rate with their cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aC9EkTrl_VN6gSuJXemmBtOgWpY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768699/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9V75SL"&gt;Google is adding heart and respiratory rate monitors to the Fit app on Pixel phones this month, and it plans to add them to other Android phones in the future. Both features rely on the smartphone camera: it measures respiratory rate by monitoring the rise and fall of a user’s chest, and heart rate by tracking color change as blood moves through the fingertip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNxMh1"&gt;The features are only intended to let users track overall wellness and cannot evaluate or diagnose medical conditions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHtheG"&gt;To measure respiratory rate (the number of breaths someone takes per minute) using the app, users point the phone’s front-facing camera at their head and chest. To measure heart rate, they place their finger over the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66z2Drv_3d8aGxVhzGoE6KrjFQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279419/RR_Pixel_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel users can measure their respiratory rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fEjYOZ"&gt;A doctor counts a patient’s respiratory rate by watching their chest rise and fall, and the Google feature mimics that procedure, said Jack Po, a product manager at Google Health, in a press briefing. “The machine learning technique that we leverage basically tries to emulate that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NaUF5"&gt;Google’s heart rate monitor is similar to a feature that Samsung included&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on a number of older model Galaxy smartphones, including the Galaxy &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/07/galaxy-s10-vs-s20-2020-which-should-you-buy/"&gt;S10&lt;/a&gt;. The company removed the feature for the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/i-cannot-measure-heart-rate-with-my-galaxy-s10e/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S10E&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/07/galaxy-s10-vs-s20-2020-which-should-you-buy/"&gt;S20&lt;/a&gt;, and later phones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KQc6"&gt;Heart rate data from Google’s app will be less comprehensive than the types of readings someone could get from a wearable device, which can continuously monitor something like heart rate as someone goes through their daily life. But an at-home feature that can check in on these metrics on demand is still a useful tool, Po said in the briefing. Anything that increases the number of measurements someone has of their heart or breathing rate is important — doctors, for example, usually only get a measurement at most every few months as someone comes into an office, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtjWAy"&gt;“If users were to take their heart rate once a week, they would actually get a lot of value,” Po said. “They’ll get a lot of value in tracking whether their heart rate might be improving, if exercise is paying off.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_c9MiwziyRUdZpqK56Wql5vKEmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279429/Google_Fit_measuring_heart_rate.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EwoGCJ"&gt;Google chose to incorporate these functions into the smartphone in order to make it accessible to the widest number of people, Po said. “A lot of people, especially in disadvantaged economic classes right now, don’t have things like wearables, but would still really benefit from the ability to be able to track their breathing rate, heart rate, et cetera.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vag54F"&gt;Internal studies on Pixel phones showed that the respiratory rate feature was accurate within one breath per minute both for people with and without health conditions, said Jiening Zhan, a technical lead at Google Health, during the press briefing. The heart rate feature was accurate within 2 percent. That feature was tested on people with a range of skin tones, and it had a similar accuracy for light and dark skin, she said. The team plans to publish a scientific paper with the data from its evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yue4Hc"&gt;The team will study how well the features work on other phones before making them available outside of the Pixel. “We want to make sure that you know, the rigorous testing is done before it’s released to other devices,” Zhan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVxo1M"&gt;Right now, the features are described as tools that can be used for general wellness. Google isn’t claiming that they can perform a medical function — which is why it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;doesn’t need clearance&lt;/a&gt; from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add them to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwNSM7"&gt;Eventually, they might take the app down that road, Po indicated. The tests done on the features show that they’re consistent with clinical products, he said, so it’s a possibility in the future. “Frankly, we haven’t done enough testing and validation to say that it can definitely work for those use cases yet, but it’s definitely something we’re exploring,” Po said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKTgXt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajRVN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Brio, the holy grail of webcams, is $40 off right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRvk8sDgPfVp-sTsOeYoN_tgl0E=/0x311:2180x1764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768290/s3_rgb_jpg_med_Babylon_FOB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GxAvvg"&gt;Not long ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14531452/logitech-brio-4k-pro-webcam"&gt;Logitech’s Brio&lt;/a&gt; webcam (along with almost any other kind of webcam made by reputable companies) was impossible to find. We’re now at the point where you can get $40 off this 4K model through Lenovo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Faccessories-and-monitors%2Fwebcams-and-video%2Fwebcams%2FLogitech-BRIO-4K-Ultra-HD-webcam-web-camera%2Fp%2F78010686&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266146%2Flogitech-brio-webcam-seagate-xbox-nvme-ssd-hisense-tv-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knocking it down to $160&lt;/a&gt; instead of $200. It’s still a big investment, but if you stream or just want to look your best in a meeting, this is one of the best choices out there to suit those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34u7CS"&gt;Lenovo is currently the only site hosting this deal, so it may not last for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cc4gi1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319769"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkg3gK"&gt;Xbox Series X / S owners can get $10 off one of Seagate’s 1TB NVMe expansion cards at Newegg. Normally $220, it’s $210 if you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EMCESEU56 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This device is useful for storing games that are made expressly for the new Xbox consoles, as it’s just as fast as the SSD that’s inside of each system. Note that using the code will require you to subscribe to Newegg’s deals newsletter, if you don’t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="08EPS3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wcuvln"&gt;If you can’t get enough TV deals, Best Buy is offering its great discount on Hisense’s massive 85-inch 4K HDR TV again. Instead of its original $1,700 asking price, it’s down to $1,000. This model ships with Android TV software built in, enabling you to watch most streaming services from the TV itself without the need for extra hardware, like a streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dEbKLX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741474"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Rad Power Bikes raises $150 million to grow its electric bike empire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKQFbqxJDC2GDOTikyY3OmhGgog=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768601/akrales_191002_3677_0032.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tfq3zp"&gt;Rad Power Bikes just announced a $150 million investment to expand its retail footprint and improve its maintenance and repair services. It’s one of the largest investments in an e-bike company to date and reflects the growing demand for electric-powered transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw2OSU"&gt;Investors in this round include Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund, Counterpoint Global; Fidelity Management and Research Company; The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG; and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as existing investors like Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JbRLZF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think overall it’s a really exciting moment for the direct-to-consumer e-bike space and for e-bikes just in general”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVRBZO"&gt;“I think overall it’s a really exciting moment for the direct-to-consumer e-bike space and for e-bikes just in general,” Rad Power Bikes CEO Mike Radenbaugh told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a recent interview. “This amount of fundraising is normally reserved for — how should I say this — less cash-efficient businesses, like bike-share for example, and this amount of funding really allows us to invest in doubling down on serious infrastructure, both supply chain and after-sales support and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5OzjX8Rn9NHvbSJ-Vwhjx5UfA7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280953/378437_2_cfc583_original_1612411492.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ckwr90"&gt;Rad Power Bikes plans on doubling its 325-person workforce by next year, Radenbaugh said, with a heavy focus on research and development. It will also allow the company to accelerate the expansion of its retail and service network, which is already slated to cover 75 percent of US customers by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXpAtd"&gt;Rad Power Bikes is the largest e-bike maker in the US, offering 11 different models, from the fat-tire Rad Rover to the new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21299601/rad-power-bike-radmission-electric-bike-ebike-price-specs"&gt;slimmer RadMission&lt;/a&gt;. Radenbaugh founded the company in 2015, after several years of selling his custom-made e-bikes to customers on the West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LxGhw"&gt;Venture capital firms have been pouring money into electric bike and scooter companies over the past few years. But while investor interest in shared scooter companies in particular appears to have cooled off in recent months, e-bike makers continue to attract a lot of attention, especially as sales numbers spiked during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pMlhI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ezyOeN"&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;enormously popular over the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;. A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62-percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144 percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVmxI9"&gt;Consulting firm Deloitte &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;estimated in a report last year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of e-bikes in circulation worldwide should reach 300 million by 2023 — a 50-percent increase over 2019’s 200 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdt7DS"&gt;Investors see a clear opportunity in continuing to fuel that growth. Rad Power Bikes closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rad-power-bikes-closes-25-million-in-funding-to-grow-direct-to-consumer-electric-bike-business-300999573.html"&gt;$25 million deal&lt;/a&gt; last February, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;Dutch e-bike brand VanMoof landed $40 million&lt;/a&gt; in September. European VCs poured $165 million into e-bikes in 2019 and 2020, more than the previous four years combined, according to data from PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kG6L3"&gt;Radenbaugh hinted the added capital will help grow Rad Power Bikes beyond the world of two-wheeled transportation. “We’ve got our sights set on something much bigger than an e-bike brand and that’s what these investors saw as they started to dig deeper into Rad,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcokFbaWU9qlgedeKadPm7c-P3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768503/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fao8AG"&gt;It’s no secret Apple is hard at work on augmented and virtual reality devices, with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January claiming Apple is working on an ultra-high-end, pricey headset that could hit stores in 2022. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on what to expect from the potential headset, including a rendering — said to be based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype from last year” — of what the device might actually look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otDr5Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s report corroborates several details from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s, including the fabric mesh material that the company is said to be using in order to lighten the weight of the device — and the high price tag. The new report claims the price could reach approximately $3,000, considerably higher than most other standalone VR headsets, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the $299 Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxQvjR"&gt;The alleged design also appears to borrow cues from a variety of other Apple devices, including swappable Apple Watch-style headbands and a HomePod-esque mesh fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="soEngY"&gt;There are also new details on the actual hardware for the rumored device, which is said to offer both VR and mixed reality applications, thanks to over a dozen cameras (for tracking hand movement) and LIDAR sensors (for mapping rooms, similar to AR effects on the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro). It is also said to feature dual 8K displays with eye-tracking technology that could offer resolution far beyond any current commercial VR headsets on the market today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1BTwT"&gt;Notably, the report claims Apple won’t be running the power-hungry 8K displays at full resolution the entire time. Instead, the device will use the eye-tracking technology to determine where users are looking and then rendering peripheral areas in lower resolution to improve performance (a technique in the VR world known as foveated rendering). The chips, as previously reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, are expected to be internally developed Apple Silicon hardware that could potentially be more powerful than Apple’s current M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x2J91"&gt;Apple is reportedly experimenting with a variety of control methods, including hand-tracking and eye-tracking, a dial mounted on the side of the headset, and a “thimble-like” accessory, although nothing is said to be finalized just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tE5v9"&gt;The headset, described mostly as a VR device with more limited AR functions, is still intended to be a key step toward Apple’s ultimate goal: a lightweight AR device indistinguishable from standard eyeglasses. That device is still said to be years away from release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdyVXF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtGUsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview’s facial recognition tech is illegal mass surveillance, Canada privacy commissioners say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyOWKhL5eHGSQuU10cEqywxgzk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768357/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3WIxq"&gt;Clearview AI’s facial recognition amounts to mass surveillance and the company should delete the faces of Canadians from its database, &lt;a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210203/"&gt;Canada’s privacy commissioners said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNAkos"&gt;Commissioner Daniel Therrien said what Clearview does — scraping photos from social media and other public sites for use by law enforcement — is “illegal” and creates a system that “inflicts broad-based harm on all members of society, who find themselves continually in a police lineup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E68Q7l"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2021/pipeda-2021-001/#toc2"&gt;commissioners released a report&lt;/a&gt; that follows a yearlong investigation by several Canadian privacy agencies into Clearview’s practices, which found the company had collected highly sensitive biometric information without consent and that it “used and disclosed Canadians’ personal information for inappropriate purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kC92jL"&gt;According to the investigators, the company maintains that Canada’s privacy laws don’t apply to Clearview since it does not have a “real and substantial connection” to the country, and that consent from individuals was not required because the information it collected was publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDUEFL"&gt;Clearview’s database of some 3 billion images was revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;raising serious concerns about privacy&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s practice of taking images from social media violated the platforms’ rules, and tech platforms sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;cease-and-desist orders to Clearview&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K3ej2s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dozens of law enforcement agencies in Canada had used the software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NUecjt"&gt;Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/technology/clearview-ai-illegal-canada.html?"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company had ceased operations in Canada last July due to the investigation, and he added that Clearview was not planning to delete Canadians’ images from its database, but that people could request their data be removed by using an opt-out form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsBFVi"&gt;The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was among the dozens of law enforcement and other organizations in Canada that had paid for Clearview’s services.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3XgQu"&gt;The commissioners don’t have the authority to fine companies or order them to leave Canada, but they sent a letter of intention to Clearview telling the company to stop scraping images of Canadians’ faces, stop offering its facial recognition product in Canada, and to delete previously collected images of Canadians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWMSVr"&gt;It’s not the first time Clearview has been ordered to remove images from its database. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;terminated all its contracts in the state of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; last May — the majority of which were with law enforcement agencies — following a lawsuit alleging Clearview had violated the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act. Clearview also said at the time it was canceling the contracts of any non-law enforcement entities; a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Clearview’s list of private clients had included Bank of America, Walmart, and Macy’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8oem3"&gt;Clearview did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but the company plans to challenge the decision in court. A spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that Clearview collects “public information from the internet, which is explicitly permitted,” and likened what it does to Google. “Clearview AI is a search engine that collects public data just as much larger companies do, including Google, which is permitted to operate in Canada,” the spokesperson argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb0kA9"&gt;Use of Clearview AI’s facial recognition among law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;spiked 26 percent on January 7th&lt;/a&gt;, one day after a mob of rioters attacked the US Capitol, with several police departments using Clearview software to assist the FBI with identifying the rioters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;Clearview also has contracts&lt;/a&gt; with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdl7BN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The electric Mustang Mach-E takes Ford in a whole new direction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZExk315vHYCMAv0ZBBuKL9H8R3I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768238/sokane_210125_4386_1765.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Will people saddle up for the ride?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gSviTO"&gt;To make an all-electric Mustang is to dabble in blasphemy — doubly so if you also make it an SUV. Mustangs are known for their roaring engines, not for converting DC power to AC power. And they sure as hell aren’t the kind of car you throw your family in for a trip to the zoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQmEzH"&gt;But that’s what Ford has done with the Mustang Mach-E. It’s taken an idea that’s unfathomable to many — tinkering with What A Mustang Is — and has made it the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/9/17832582/ford-mach-1-electric-ev-cars"&gt;centerpiece of an $11 billion push to make electric vehicles go mainstream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXF0pM"&gt;After spending a week with the Mustang Mach-E in Premium trim (which starts at $47,000), it feels like that bet will pay off. The Mach-E is solidly built, a delight to drive, and puts technology front and center in a way legacy automakers usually mess up. It’s cheaper than the luxury EVs that have saturated the early market, but it’s more functional and fun than truly budget-minded ones like the Chevy Bolt. It’s the most competent electric vehicle not made by Tesla or Porsche on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JULc8p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the most competent EV not made by Tesla or Porsche right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fcalbp"&gt;The Mach-E requires some sacrifices. The software powering its massive touchscreen could use a little work. The cheaper models could use more range. Charging is a major headache if you can’t plug in at home, despite Ford’s effort to coalesce the disparate options on the market. And if you truly feel like you’ll miss that engine roar, I hate to say that Ford’s digital replacement is not much of a consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0L36S"&gt;Really, though, the Mach-E probably isn’t for people who stay up late posting about V8s. Instead, it’s the kind of car that will get a lot of new people interested in electric vehicles — even if they don’t wind up buying a Mach-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBkMmTQI4Ju03guPpx24yXqO4Qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278740/sokane_210125_4386_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="U8W038"&gt;Pony, but make it electric  &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="fIiYTd"&gt;Ford could have chosen any number of options for its first mass market EV. It could have made something entirely new. It could have waited until its all-electric F-150 was ready and leveraged the popularity of trucks to reach the masses with battery-powered cars. It could have simply made a more capable electric Focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOrDp0"&gt;In fact, that last option &lt;a href="https://www.motor1.com/features/382783/ford-mustang-mach-e-boring-front-drive-compliance-car/"&gt;was basically the plan&lt;/a&gt; until the team working on the car asked to make something more like a Mustang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWZ2Zz"&gt;So since Ford dared to make its first mass-market EV a Mustang, let’s talk Mustang things, like performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4rfVy"&gt;The Premium model I tested was fitted with the extended range battery pack (98kWh with 88kWh of usable energy) and a two-motor setup that gives it all-wheel drive capability, which all told is good for about 270 miles. The resulting 346 horsepower is enough to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about five seconds despite the car weighing more than two tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZcIvOIYOXC6jrVhkUcoyxJeEpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278746/sokane_210125_4386_0025.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddsJSkOiyC331_D2qhtGVjYXyc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278742/sokane_210125_4386_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdQGyPkjyNjNUuXfkhvvWxLWORU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278739/sokane_210125_4386_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wwfo6"&gt;That was enough giddyup for me in an SUV of this size, even if it’s a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;heart-stopping &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; off the line that Porsche’s Taycan or Tesla’s fastest performance models can do. The more expensive GT and GT Performance models coming later this year will be quicker, for sure, making the 0 to 60 run in 3.8 and 3.5 seconds, respectively. That sounds fun, though that comes at the literal expense of more money, but also range, with the GT model topping out at 250 miles on a full battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xRFG9"&gt;I was more than comfortable with 270 miles, though I wouldn’t want to buy one of the models with less. Ford is making a few of those. The rear-wheel-drive versions of the Premium and the “Select” — the cheapest model, starting at around $43,000 — get just 230 miles out of the standard range pack (which has a capacity of 75.7kWh with 68kWh of usable energy), and 211 miles in all-wheel-drive configuration.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ox3Tm3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of giddyup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uY6hl9"&gt;You’ll get more with Tesla’s similarly priced electric cars, to be sure. The base Model 3 ($37,990) offers 263 miles while the long-range version ($46,990) can travel 353 miles. The base Model Y ($41,990) makes it 244 miles, while the long-range spec ($49,990) lasts 326 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t025Ix"&gt;A major source of my comfort with the Mach-E’s range, though, was that Ford’s running estimate of miles remaining never wavered. In some EVs, the remaining range fluctuates wildly as you drive, which can ruin confidence in the figure on the screen. Not so in the Mach-E. The software — which no doubt leverages Ford’s years of experience making hybrid vehicles — displays a range estimate as reliable as a gas gauge. As a result, I left my house to start a 30-mile drive with close to 100 miles of range remaining and didn’t have to worry about scrambling to find a charger before reaching my destination.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZDvJYW-eyJOLDGijTxjhOECrLBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278738/sokane_210125_4386_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5QPRU"&gt;Still, if I were shopping, I’d consider going with the rear-wheel-drive configuration of the Premium model or the RWD-only California Route 1 model, which both offer 305 miles of range, for peace of mind and a little extra help on longer drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcv1hT"&gt;Besides being reasonably fast, the Mustang Mach-E is fun to drive. There are three driving modes, dubbed Unbridled, Engage, and Whisper (think Sport, Comfort, and Eco). Unbridled offers the tightest steering and the quickest acceleration, and it’s just generally your best bet if you’re flirting with local speed limits. Whisper is, of course, the quietest and has really smooth coasting when you lift off the throttle. Engaged is somewhere in the middle, a mix of somewhat sporty driving but without the &lt;em&gt;oomph &lt;/em&gt;of Unbridled mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRj3QB"&gt;The weight of the battery pack kept the Mustang Mach-E firmly planted through tight corners, and the SUV still felt nimble thanks to its acceleration. The battery pack also increases the ride height, meaning visibility is great, though the driving experience is much different than in a low-to-the-ground combustion-engine Mustang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OO3QuA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Visibility is great even though it’s not an enormous SUV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EN6wSi"&gt;Speed and handling aren’t the only components that make up the traditional Mustang experience. For many, a Mustang is not a Mustang without the roar of a combustion engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QisjPn"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E just may not be for them. It’s, at times, almost eerily quiet. There’s a slight steady whine of the electric motors at low speeds (and a low exterior hum as well, for pedestrians). But at faster speeds there’s little more than the dull whoosh of road noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jngPL"&gt;Ford &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; created a futuristic engine-like sound that can be turned on and off, but I found it lacking and left if off almost the entire time. Unlike artificial engine noises in cars like, say, the hybrid BMW i8, which I didn’t mind, the Mach E’s sound felt unconvincing and a little distracting, like someone was running the low note of a Wurlitzer through a distortion pedal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyZ7BK"&gt;I’m a lifelong racing fan, so I love the sound of a tuned-up performance engine. But I’m also one of those people who doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; that rumble to have some fun in a car like this, let alone to use it every day. Ford can roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21331808/ford-mustang-mach-e-1400-horsepower-performance-drift-donuts"&gt;as many 1,400-horsepower variants&lt;/a&gt; as it wants to show off what electric cars are capable of, but it’s going to have a hard time convincing some die-hards they can get by without that sound. Instead, I think Ford’s better off focusing their efforts on winning over new, or at least &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; customers, people like me who don’t need the sound of a V8 to appreciate the pep the Mach-E packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHTYXty3xnMBFCrCsPkdv_u4KAk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280381/sokane_210125_4386_1789_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsHOdL"&gt;There’s one other component of the Mach-E’s “Mustang-ness,” and that’s its looks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ygh10f"&gt;At first glance it looked a bit strange, especially with the grill-less design on the model I tested. But the front half of the Mach-E really grew on me. I think it’s rather striking when looking at it head-on or from the side. I’m less in love with the look of the car from the rear, where it looks like the Mustang’s iconic tri-bar lighting is trying to escape from the back of a more pedestrian SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZqn3V"&gt;I’d also much rather have the Mach-E in the bright “grabber blue” or head-turning “cyber orange” Ford is saving for its most expensive models, as opposed to the metallic silver version I drove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IT9Qqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is striking but familiar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jop7Qz"&gt;Overall, the Mach-E is just different enough to catch people’s eyes without looking too strange. I got a lot of thumbs-ups and questions while I had it and was stopped twice &lt;em&gt;while driving&lt;/em&gt;, so Ford clearly made something that is noticeable and familiar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjsCZj"&gt;That’s a good thing for electric vehicles, which up until now — Teslas aside — have either looked so different to the point of being off-putting, or so much like their gas counterparts that most people can’t tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2p5xXbfXWxy9eCG7rXj_fbK8KE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280369/sokane_210125_4386_1883.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sqZrQ4"&gt;Interior &amp;amp; software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="bxCox1"&gt;One of the only places Ford has a clear leg up on Tesla is (shocker) overall build quality and comfort. Tesla famously struggled with the quality of its early Model 3s, but problems persist and range from minor (slightly misaligned body panels) to severe (like &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/06/16/tesla-model-y-quality-issues/"&gt;detached seatbelts&lt;/a&gt;, or how one Model Y’s &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-model-y-ev-safety-quality-issues-problems/"&gt;glass roof fell off&lt;/a&gt;). With the Mustang Mach-E, though, there aren’t any big seams between the exterior panels, there are no loose bits, and there’s not a lot of road noise. The Mach-E is just pretty clearly the product of an automaker that has spent a century nearly perfecting the car-making process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvpoB2"&gt;The interior is especially comfortable without feeling &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; nice that you wouldn’t want to eat a cheeseburger in it. It’s also well-appointed with tech without feeling overwhelming, like the cockpit of a modern Mercedes-Benz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9YcUM"&gt;There are a few USB-A and USB-C plugs throughout, and a wireless charging pad, which I loved in theory, but in practice my iPhone 12 Pro kept sliding around, repeatedly triggering a distracting error message on the screen. It’s the kind of issue you don’t want in a car that’s supposed to be about fun driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86NkAn"&gt;But the main draw inside the Mustang Mach-E is the 15.5-inch portrait touchscreen on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnXv9w"&gt;It’s solidly bolted in place despite the floating effect and, better yet, seems like it will withstand years of grubby paws hammering away. The quality of the panel is great, too. The graphics are crisp, the colors are bright, and you really have to go hunting to see any pixels or jagged edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bM75JX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a huge screen, but Ford uses it well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uHdGdj"&gt;The big silver volume knob at the bottom of the display has a satisfying thunk-y feedback. It’s also a clever bit of design: it’s adhered to the screen and &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-volume-knob-secret/"&gt;uses capacitive material to essentially fake out the touchscreen&lt;/a&gt;. While I was happy to see &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;mapped to a physical control, I wound up using the volume button on the steering wheel half the time or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgAZr2"&gt;The logic of the Sync 4 interface on the main screen feels a little fuzzy. There’s a sort of webOS-style card system that runs across the middle of the display, which is supposed to surface frequently used functions. In my time with the car, though, it favored less immediately crucial information like tire pressure over other settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ItXKR"&gt;Some of the animations in the main screen lag a bit, like when switching between drive modes. There are a few other quirks in the UI design that bothered me, too. For instance, when you search for something using Ford’s mapping system, like electric vehicle chargers or the nearest Target, you can’t move the map to populate new search results — you have to scroll the list underneath the map instead. (Ford’s companion app, which is good &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;, also has some UI issues — particularly when you try to pinch and zoom on the map.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZXU7XxGmLzZpYoIn26nPlFYzpl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278730/sokane_210121_4386_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VZIrri"&gt;I also wish it was possible to customize the instrument cluster screen. For one thing, it’d be helpful to see how many kilowatt hours per mile you’re using there (this does show up on one of the cards on the main display but only as part of an overall “trip meter” graphic). Ford created a few different designs for the instrument cluster that change depending on which driving mode you’re in, but it otherwise doesn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGqcwS"&gt;In fact, I’d appreciate more information about energy consumption in general. While I understand there’s value in streamlining the experience, I’ve always found pleasure in trying to maximize my energy consumption in hybrid or electric vehicles — including some Fords — and it’s just kind of hard to do in the Mustang Mach-E. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12Hx3n"&gt;These are all things that could be changed with over-the-air software updates, which is something Ford has promised with the Mustang Mach-E. That’s another thing Tesla has popularized over the years, but one that legacy automakers tend to get wrong, so here’s hoping Ford has better luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="08AX4e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The software could use some love, but it’s better than what most automakers craft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3nBu9D"&gt;I used wireless CarPlay the majority of the time I had the car out of pure convenience and familiarity — wireless Android Auto is also available — but this new version of Ford’s in-house infotainment software Sync is perfectly competent. It can seem a little confusing and overstuffed at first. But you know what? Car menu systems have been intimidating and confusing for years now, especially as automakers transitioned to bigger screens and started to rely more and more on touch controls. I’d much rather sort through that confusion on a bigger screen like the Mach E’s than on a smaller rectangle buried in a sea of buttons and knobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fABlg"&gt;And while there are &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;good reasons to be wary about pouring so much of a car’s functionality into the touchscreen&lt;/a&gt;, especially one so large, Ford at least made the most-used buttons big and easily reachable with forgiving hit boxes. If anything, I was surprised at how little attention I paid to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMfJ4G"&gt;There is one big thing missing on the Mustang Mach-E I wish I could have tested, which is Ford’s hands-free driving mode. It’s supposed to be comparable to what Cadillac has been doing for a few years with Super Cruise. The Mustang Mach-E will be the first to get it, though not for another few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7yfCM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A hands-free driving mode is on the way — but it’s not here yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WR619m"&gt;In the meantime, the Mach-E has a more typical advanced driver assistance package that includes features like lane centering, meaning it can keep the car in the center of the lane even around highway bends. It’s helpful for monotonous highway driving, though like other ADAS systems, there were times where the lane centering canceled unexpectedly. It’s something you’ll want to keep a close eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OLJ0X"&gt;Even when the true hands-free driving option comes out, it’ll only be available on highways that Ford maps ahead of time. And if you purchase that option, there’s a camera behind the steering wheel that will track your eyes to make sure you’re paying attention to the road. So don’t expect the Mach-E to be even remotely close to a fully self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z_aD_1agpLjK_liT9GOg2eyDeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278732/sokane_210121_4386_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="uR9YGl"&gt;Infrastructure weak&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="QwcKjL"&gt;For the most part, driving the Mach-E was a really great experience. But the biggest drawback is the same one that plagues any non-Tesla EV: charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MgN1y"&gt;If you don’t own a Tesla, charging in the US is just a mess right now. There are multiple networks with different charging capacities, pricing structures, and upkeep for their stations. And it’s a real hit-or-miss experience that’s difficult to navigate &lt;em&gt;even if you know all of that going in&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aYjkN"&gt;For instance, I took one drive to an Electrify America station, which is basically Volkswagen’s fledgling version of Tesla’s Supercharger network, and still ran into problems. The first plug I tried gave me repeated error messages. When I tried another plug, a moth flew out, and then the car charged far slower than it is supposed to. It was only after trying multiple stalls that I finally got a charging rate worth staying connected to — around 77kW, about half of what the Mustang Mach-E is ultimately supposed to get out of these fast-charging stations. (It was also somehow the only Electrify America station in all of Austin, Texas, which really needs to up its charging infrastructure game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D4uli7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charging can still be a massive headache if you can’t plug in at home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgJxsq"&gt;What makes this hassle worse is that every time you switch stalls, you waste more time than you expected to spend charging. It’s already a drag knowing you may have to spend 30 minutes at a fast-charging station filling up your car’s battery. But it’s worse when you have to spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time doing this do-si-do between different charging stalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwwMpY"&gt;And if Volkswagen’s charging network isn’t getting it right, that doesn’t bode well for smaller networks. And even when &lt;em&gt;those &lt;/em&gt;chargers work well, they’re charging your car more slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/swkI6pfpvYX6d3m-MXte0tV1Nyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278735/sokane_210121_4386_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vp4hcTbtTQER8771G5XPsK9LjEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280370/sokane_210125_4386_1835.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SIzXug"&gt;This is a problem, and it needs to be fixed. It’s not necessarily Ford’s problem to fix, though Ford &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; combining a lot of these networks into what it has dubbed the “FordPass Charging Network.” In theory it’s a really good idea. Ford makes all these charging networks easy to find in the FordPass app, or in the dashboard screen of the Mach-E, providing owners a one-stop shop for charging. The automaker’s even trying to bundle some of the services so owners don’t need an account for every disparate network or app. In theory, you just drive your Mach-E up to participating chargers, plug in, and let Ford’s software take care of all of the financial stuff in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IH39Qa"&gt;That doesn’t quite work just yet, and the problem that Ford is going to face in the meantime is that people may buy this car, use this FordPass Charging Network, still run into some of those problems, and wind up thinking that the company’s charging network is a real bummer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY53G0"&gt;I hope those various charging networks can improve their services quickly, and in fact, many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;are raising a lot of money in order to do just that&lt;/a&gt;. But even in a best-case scenario, it’s going to be another few years before you can buy an electric vehicle that’s not a Tesla and experience Supercharger convenience — which feels like a very big bottleneck when you consider the market legacy automakers say they’re going to be able to create with electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkHzLL"&gt;This equation changes if you can charge where you live. I was able to put about 65 miles into the Mustang Mach-E in around 23 hours at home through a regular old 120V outlet on the outside of our house — nothing to celebrate but enough of a buffer to cover most daily driving. But that wouldn’t completely remove the need to charge elsewhere. Longer trips would still be a gamble. And there are many people in this country who just don’t have the option to plug in while they sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYASANdrpGQ91bO5kxjKI14TlkM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278733/sokane_210121_4386_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RdGuIy"&gt;The road ahead &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6tgmLc"&gt;I don’t think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The striking design easily stands out in a crowd, but the Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar. It’s the kind of car that, if enough of them are on the road in a few years, could really make people consider non-Tesla electric cars in a way that ones like the Jaguar I-Pace, or the Audi E-Tron, or the Chevy Bolt never have (or will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoeSAW"&gt;I think Ford is tapping into something with the Mustang Mach-E that only Tesla really does well right now, which is making a truly modern vehicle and trying to bring it to the mainstream. The Mustang Mach-E is the kind of product that could make people feel like they’re missing out on something the more they see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOto80"&gt;There are still hurdles to clear, starting with the fact that the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt; first batch of Mustang Mach-E deliveries has been delayed&lt;/a&gt;. Ford’s not the only company to face this problem — Volkswagen, Audi, and others have all run into issues getting their first mass market EVs on the road — but it’s one Ford needs to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iy4eEq"&gt;Even when it does, Ford will have other questions to answer, too, like around charging, how receptive dealers will be to this car, how Ford’s software updates will go, and how good — and more importantly how safe — the hands-free driving feature will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bYvVmj"&gt;But for now, the Mach-E exists, and that’s an achievement in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’re starting an online class, check to make sure your professor is alive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vpmyQGM5T0EiqBKxU8qLkHjLlA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767842/acastro_210202_4396_posthumousTeaching_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A college student Googled his remote instructor and found an obituary&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="twiT5e"&gt;Three weeks into his online class on art history, Concordia University sophomore Aaron Ansuini had a question about one of the recorded lectures. He combed through Concordia’s portal, but couldn’t find his professor’s contact information. So he Googled his name — François-Marc Gagnon — and found an obituary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmv6QK"&gt;At first, Ansuini thought it might be a coincidence. “I was like ‘That’s weird, he has the same name,’” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; But further Googling revealed a more disturbing truth. In March 2019, over a year prior to the start of Ansuini’s course, Gagnon had passed away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUWkMJ"&gt;“It was weird and very scary,” Ansuini said. When registering for the class, he’d received no indication that Gagnon was teaching posthumously. The &lt;a href="https://www.econcordia.com/my2/CourseOutline/View.aspx?course=realism_abstraction"&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; named a different professor as the official instructor, but stated that Gagnon would deliver the lectures — an arrangement not uncommon for Concordia classes. All email communication had come, unsigned, from a “do-not-reply” address. For the first three weeks, Ansuini had assumed those emails were from Gagnon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQ3sk"&gt;The revelation has completely changed Ansuini’s class experience. “I don’t really even want to watch the lectures anymore,” he says. Participating makes him sad; he tries to space the lectures out between other classes so he can take breaks. “It doesn’t feel like a class. It feels like one of those websites, like a Skillshare.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYp86M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It doesn’t feel like a class”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoknU"&gt;The past year has been a trial-and-error process for Ansuini and &lt;a href="https://www.qualityinfo.org/-/growth-in-distance-learning-outpaces-total-enrollment-growth"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of other college students around the world who are taking classes online amid COVID-19, as their schools navigate a new remote curriculum. While online education existed long before the novel coronavirus, the pandemic has put a massive swath of learners and families through the various motions of online learning — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"&gt;remote test proctoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21419012/edgenuity-online-class-ai-grading-keyword-mashing-students-school-cheating-algorithm-glitch"&gt;automated grading&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21559291/school-shooter-lockdown-code-red-drills-online-zoom-covid"&gt;safety drills&lt;/a&gt;. It’s brought heightened scrutiny to strategies that schools have been employing for years, and a new urgency to the question of how much transparency institutions owe their students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyB0Z2"&gt;Legally, the school is likely within its rights to continue using a professor’s recorded lecture after their death. “Generally when you work with a university, you sign a contract that says ... intellectual property you generate is our property,” says Joseph D’Angelo, an attorney who specializes in IP, copyright, and trademark. “There’s not much you can do about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2bBwQ"&gt;That’s not always the understanding on the ground, though. “I think the default position in higher ed is that an institution doesn’t stake claim to a professor’s course materials or lectures,” says Jeremy Bassetti, a humanities professor at Valencia College. “If I were alive and I learned that another professor was facilitating a course I developed without my consent, I would ... make some phone calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1NZiGg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many universities’ blackboard installs will literally not allow you to delete video lectures once you’ve uploaded them. It’s no stretch to think universities will try to use these to re-teach courses sans prof, with only a TA, copyright or not. Be mindful. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yhb8Emv1WI"&gt;https://t.co/yhb8Emv1WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mar Hicks (@histoftech) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/histoftech/status/1291110549183442948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSwY3q"&gt;Bassetti isn’t alone there. As colleges announced their plans to move instruction online throughout early 2020, scores of faculty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373669/recorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;expressed fear&lt;/a&gt; that their universities would use their recorded lectures as they pleased. “It’s no stretch to think that universities will try to use these to re-teach courses sans prof, with only a TA,” one professor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/histoftech/status/1291110549183442948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1291110549183442948%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21373669%2Frecorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. “Be mindful.” In mid-March, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21175420/university-college-closure-coronavirus-covid19-housing-internet-security"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of US universities abruptly shifted to recorded models, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers publicly warned schools to keep their hands off new recordings. “Institutions should not take this opportunity to appropriate intellectual property to which they would not otherwise have had access,” their &lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aft-and-aaup-principles-higher-education-response-covid-19#.XsK0IC2ZPPA"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG8mLw"&gt;In countries where lecture recording was common pre-pandemic, the issue has been controversial for years. In 2018, when the UK’s University and College Union organized a nationwide &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; in response to suggested pension cuts, &lt;a href="https://thetab.com/uk/warwick/2018/02/26/warwick-university-propose-use-of-lecture-capture-to-combat-strikes-26691"&gt;some universities&lt;/a&gt; proposed running recorded lessons in order to keep classes going. (In 2016, &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lti/2016/11/10/lecture-recording-in-uk-higher-education-results-from-a-survey/"&gt;over 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the country’s institutions were using lecture recording systems). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373669/recorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;Backlash&lt;/a&gt; to those proposals was so severe that it led some schools to permanently change their recording policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YIcR4"&gt;Students have also taken issue with the lack of access to their instructors. COVID-19 has drawn new attention to an age-old, persistent question: what is college tuition actually paying for? Some US colleges have kept their typical price tags in place after moving their courses online; &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/07/harvard-full-tuition-coronavirus.html"&gt;supporters&lt;/a&gt; have argued that they’re still, after all, providing the same degree. But these decisions have been met with &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/harvard-hit-with-backlash-for-keeping-tuition-costs"&gt;widespread&lt;/a&gt; blowback from students and families who claim that online classes don’t provide the same benefits as in-person ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwAFbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an access issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2aigPg"&gt;College students commonly pay tuition, and register for classes, with the expectation that they’ll have some degree of access to their professors — through discussion groups, office hours, in-class questions, even the ability to chat by email or phone. Intuitively, that’s the argument for taking university classes online rather than watching lectures on YouTube for free. A deceased professor can’t respond to emails, facilitate class discussions, or provide networking opportunities — and while that’s not a dealbreaker for all students, it may be for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF4K9d"&gt;Ansuini is one such student. He has a learning disability, and following up with instructors outside of class has been an important aspect of his online education. “When there’s an asynchronous lecture I’ll communicate with the teacher and I’ll build a back-and-forth with them so they know I’m keeping up,” Ansuini says. A situation where his professor is unreachable is “an access issue.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEMuVC"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Concordia spokesperson Vannina Maestracci said, “We, of course, regret that this student felt they had not been clearly informed and have updated Dr. Gagnon’s biography in the course information provided to registered students.” Maestracci noted that Gagnon “developed this online course some years ago with eConcordia,” but did not address whether Gagnon had explicitly consented to the course running after his passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM29A2"&gt;It’s not unreasonable for students who believe they’re paying for a living, available professor to expect a living, available professor, D’Angelo says. The extra perks that come from those connections, he believes, are more than perks — they’re understood to be fundamental aspects of a university education. He likens that understanding to an unwritten contract. “You could make a legal argument ... that I signed up to all of these fringe benefits, I’m not getting it because of COVID, and I can’t even interact with this person on an electronic level,” he says. “I’m not sure they would win, if a student was to bring that suit, but I think there might be some damages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCLvPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regular scrutiny must be given by relevant program leaders”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DXuDmt"&gt;Accountability is a factor as well. A deceased professor can’t update their teaching style in response to student feedback, or modernize their material as their field moves forward. It’s important for students to know if a course may be out of date, says Stacy Peazant, an academic and research administrator at the University of Florida. “Such a course should not be exempt from evaluation by students at the end of the term, and regular scrutiny must be given by relevant program leaders,” Peazant told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kf0ZV1"&gt;The potential benefits of posthumous classes, of course, are also obvious. Online learning provides an opportunity to preserve the work of renowned educators, and pre-recorded lectures have clear utility as teaching tools, especially as a model for new lecturers. But transparency can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdcCVB"&gt;Lia, who asked to withhold her surname for privacy reasons, says she wasn’t bothered by an online modeling class she took with a deceased professor during her freshman year at Eindhoven University of Technology several years ago. The professor’s recent passing, she says, was announced during the introductory lecture. That made the course feel like a mark of respect — she appreciated that her professor could continue teaching.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pnr4bG"&gt;Still, the announcement colored the experience. “It was a little like watching a movie and knowing one of the actors in it has passed away,” Lia says. “A bit strange and unsettling, but not too distracting from the story.” Eindhoven University of Technology did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5HG1Zv"&gt;Ansuini is going to finish out his art history class. But he hopes his university will handle future situations differently. “We don’t live in a world where someone dies and you don’t care,” Ansuini says. “I think it lacked tact and respect for this teacher’s life, and his work, and his students, to think that’s not noteworthy.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego is making a Sonic Mania-themed set inspired by a fan creation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aNxOurxf6vqQK4x9G89IH7q8omE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767851/Sonic_Mania_Green_Hill_Zone_Concept_Design.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept design for the Sonic-themed set.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qz7pWK"&gt;Lego is announcing a new video game-themed set featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and characters from &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;. (If you could have told six-year-old me that someday there would be a Sonic-themed Lego set, he’d cry tears of joy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woj3ss"&gt;You can get a look at a concept design for the set, which is themed around Sonic’s classic Green Hill Zone stage, at the top of this post. I love how ridiculous Sonic looks in Lego form, and Doctor Eggman’s towering Death Egg Robot is just awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yx11YX"&gt;The concept for the set was submitted to Lego by Viv Grannell, a Sonic fan based in the UK, through the &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/"&gt;Lego Ideas program&lt;/a&gt;. Submissions need to receive 10,000 votes before Lego will consider making them an actual Lego set, so it’s no small feat that Grannell was able to get the necessary support for the idea to become a reality. If you want to see more pictures of the concept, check out Grannell’s page for the project &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/d7fef363-ead4-413e-a3e2-d9aa848e1cee"&gt;on the Lego Ideas site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCEcCs"&gt;Lego says the set is now entering the “product development phase,” so it seems like we might be a ways away from actually being able to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8kB5a"&gt;Last year, Lego dipped its toes into video game crossovers with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt;-themed sets&lt;/a&gt;. Those have an interactive element to them. The Lego Mario figure will play a sound when it is placed in a pipe or when you made it jump on a Goomba, for example. Sadly, it doesn’t seem like Lego Sonic will be able to make any noises, so don’t expect to hear any of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOvzjBW0v8w"&gt;his snarky quips&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe Lego can add those in a future set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft launches Viva, a bet on the future of remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVDaO_DYti9CJZG7P6a7nIBKFYo=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767900/microsoftremotework.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jEk2PZ"&gt;Microsoft Viva is Microsoft’s new push for helping businesses with remote work and a big bet on this new way of life becoming the norm. It’s designed to act as a portal for both employees and businesses to navigate the complexities of working from home. Microsoft is launching Viva today, with parts of the platform rolling out throughout 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dikVhE"&gt;“We have participated in the largest, at scale, remote work experiment the world has seen,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, underlining nearly 11 months of a pandemic that has reshaped how people work, learn, and live. “As the world recovers, there is no going back. Flexibility in when, where, and how we work will be key.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DD9Jfc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aDLjVQZmno?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FGV1R"&gt;Microsoft Viva isn’t an app or even a service but more of a platform for improving remote work and helping businesses adjust to it. While businesses collectively spend billions of dollars each year on employee wellbeing, Microsoft thinks Viva will help in this new digital era of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QuEp"&gt;“We need to stop thinking about work as a place, and start thinking about how to maintain culture, connect employees, and harness human ingenuity in a hybrid world,” says Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365. Spataro was quick to predict early on in the pandemic that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214314/microsoft-teams-usage-coronavirus-pandemic-work-habit-change"&gt;forever change the way we work and learn&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Viva is clearly the result of trends Microsoft has been witnessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTz590"&gt;Designed for this new flexible and digital era of work, Viva integrates into Microsoft Teams and works rather like the intranet of old by collecting essential parts of a business into a central location. Microsoft is splitting Viva up into four specific modules: connections, insights, topics, and learning. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5i6oIGd8BbCRT7i3sV8HvUMlPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280707/Connections_EXP_2_still__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Connections acts as a portal for employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUuYf6"&gt;Connections includes internal communications, or resources like benefits and company policies. It’s also designed to be the portal you’d head to if you just started working at a company and you’ve never even met your co-workers due to pandemic lockdowns. “You can think of it as a gateway to your digital workplace,” explains Spataro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIXC13"&gt;Viva Connections is built on top of Microsoft’s SharePoint technology, and it will include things like company news, town halls, or even employee resource groups and communities. It’s basically a dashboard for connecting with colleagues remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcxYN5lUpqpv2DTGg6wLwP3Si18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280708/Viva_Insights_app_in_Microsoft_Teams.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Insights provides data on work patterns and trends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSv7FS"&gt;Viva Insights feels like the next step in Microsoft’s controversial Productivity Score feature. Microsoft was widely criticized for allowing managers to drill down into data on individual employees through metadata collected from its software and services. The company was forced to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F01%2Four-commitment-to-privacy-in-microsoft-productivity-score%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;make changes to its Productivity Score&lt;/a&gt;, and Viva Insights includes similar data-driven insights for managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG1rUQ"&gt;Microsoft says Viva Insights will include data for managers and leaders to monitor work patterns and trends, but that privacy will be protected. “This means personal insights are visible only to the employee, while insights for managers and leaders are aggregated and de-identified by default to protect individual privacy,” says Spataro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNXWPT"&gt;Viva Learning is Microsoft’s third module in Viva, and like the name implies, it’s about employee learning and development. This is where employers will house training materials, courses, and other content for employee education. This will include content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, and even a business’ own content, alongside training material from third-party providers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAIQ9v9MUdbNMkHMeGPaAio2h4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280709/Learning_resources_in_Microsoft_Viva_Learning.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Learning includes all training materials for a business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MfNIMy"&gt;The last module inside Viva is Topics. “Think of Viva topics as a Wikipedia for the organization,” explains Spataro. It uses AI to organize content and automatically surfaces topic cards with documents, videos, and related people. Viva Topics will generate topic cards from apps like Office, Teams, and SharePoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3uS80"&gt;Microsoft Viva is partly launching today. Viva Topics is available now for Microsoft 365 customers, and a public preview of Viva Insights also starts today. Microsoft is also launching a private preview of Viva Learning and plans to announce more additions to Microsoft Viva throughout 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABKaaw"&gt;Microsoft says it’s only just getting started with Microsoft Viva and that it’s designed to be an “open and extensible platform” for partners. Viva also furthers Microsoft’s ambition to put Teams at the center of its strategy for work and to act as a hub into everything the company does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh3VIF"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams’ Together mode feature&lt;/a&gt;, Viva is clearly inspired by the pandemic-era drive toward remote working. While there’s still a debate around how dramatically office jobs will change once the pandemic is over, Microsoft is very much betting that the way we’re working right now is the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook blocked in Myanmar after users protest military coup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd_JGZjsu8EAFvkhSde4wNIbgLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767792/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAwt4K"&gt;Myanmar’s government has blocked access to Facebook in the country, after users turned to the company’s services to protest &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;this week’s military coup&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook confirmed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the country’s telecoms providers had been ordered to block its services, adding, “We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information.” Myanmar’s government has ordered the services to be blocked until Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yK9O0"&gt;The block comes after users reportedly turned to the social network to protest after the military ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her along with other members of her party. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that users on Facebook were sharing photos of themselves banging pots and pans as a sign of protest, as well as images of a three-fingered salute — a gesture that’s become a sign of resistance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDVKsH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RskwSX"&gt;Telecoms provider Telenor &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-military-blocks-Facebook-as-activists-call-for-protests"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it has followed the government’s orders, saying it has “decided to comply with the directive, while expressing grave concerns regarding breach of human rights.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports that an internet monitoring organization, NetBlocks, confirmed that Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all unavailable via the state-owned Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications’ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzTrDH"&gt;Facebook is an integral part of Myanmar’s internet ecosystem. “For the majority of Myanmar’s 20 million internet-connected citizens, Facebook is the internet” was how a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf"&gt;report from 2018&lt;/a&gt; put it, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes that Messenger is the primary communications channel for most of its citizens. It’s believed around half of the country’s population holds a Facebook account, meaning any attempt to block the service is a significant move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GaOnI"&gt;This close relationship between Myanmar’s internet and Facebook has created problems. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;Facebook admitted&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t done enough “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"&gt;to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence&lt;/a&gt;,” after critics said its platform had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook-idUKKCN1GO2PN"&gt;played a role in genocidal violence in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said it was investing in “people, technology and partnerships to examine and address the abuse of Facebook in Myanmar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NKSWW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjIwHm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
