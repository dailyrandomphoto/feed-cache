    <title>The first patient testimony about a Theranos test result: a miscarriage that wasn’t</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eY0C0L"&gt;Brittany Gould, wearing a black mask with a clear window through which you could see her mouth, got choked up as she told the court about her experience with Theranos in 2014. She’d used the company’s tests because they were cheap — her language was “cost-effective” — and the results told her, wrongly, that she was miscarrying. It would have been her fourth miscarriage in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dolu6h"&gt;The defense in US v. Elizabeth Holmes blocked testimony from Gould about the emotional impact of the bad test, so jurors didn’t hear how it affected her. But “the loss of all these babies and pregnancies, and going through the experience of thinking I’m losing another one, is a lot,” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-patients-the-emerging-wild-card-in-the-trial-of-elizabeth-holmes-11627915111"&gt;Gould told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview before the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQ8mCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The experience was unremarkable — until the wrong result came back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFDfIp"&gt;Gould’s bad results are the first real-world example of how Theranos’ tests affected patients. So far we’ve heard from employees about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;bad labs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;inaccurate results&lt;/a&gt; — but we haven’t seen ordinary people whose lives have been affected by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYO57h"&gt;Gould is among the patients that the government will call to testify against Holmes, who is facing 10 counts of wire fraud and two of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. But it’s hard to know exactly how many patients received bad results. Though there was a company database of millions of results, it was encrypted and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-theranos-database-is-useless-what-happened-11614205525"&gt;the government didn’t get the password to it&lt;/a&gt;; the original version of the database has been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VziAKv"&gt;Gould went to Walgreens, which hosted Theranos wellness centers, and “got my finger poked,” she testified. Besides the finger stick test, the experience was unremarkable — until the wrong result came back. Her nurse practitioner called Gould, and had to give her the bad news that it looked like she was miscarrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv94ry"&gt;Though Gould’s moment on the stand was brief, her nurse practitioner, Audra Zachman, testified at more length. Zachman had received Theranos’ promotional materials at her practice, Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care. Theranos was “very exciting” when she first heard about it, especially since the company offered to install a lab below one of the practice’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SN1AQK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Such a red flag.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c7dxeL"&gt;Gould’s previous miscarriages meant her pregnancy was considered high-risk, so Zachman ordered tests for hCG, an important hormone in pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy, its value doubles every 48 to 72 hours, Zachman said. Gould first took a test from Quest on September 30th, 2014, with a value of 1,005. Then, on October 2nd, a Theranos test showed her levels had jumped to 12,558; on October 4th, another Theranos test showed those values had plummeted to 125.58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok80Zd"&gt;While Zachman told Gould the test values suggested a miscarriage, she also told Gould to keep taking her prenatal vitamins and to get another test. This test, from Quest, on October 6th, showed results consistent with a normal pregnancy. So did the next value from Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPpovl"&gt;Those results “stood out as such a red flag” about Theranos, Zachman said. She’d never seen anything like the results Gould received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq3Pc9"&gt;Zachman complained to Theranos, and apparently corresponded with Holmes’ brother, Christian. He blamed the data entry process, not the test. But the corrected values were still concerning, since they were the same as the October 2nd results. Usually, when hGC doesn’t go up, that indicates an ectopic pregnancy, where the fetus has implanted outside the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxT7W3"&gt;Because Zachman didn’t receive an explanation that satisfied her from Theranos, she stopped referring patients there. Still, she kept getting results from Theranos because her patients brought them in; they didn’t need a doctor’s order to get a blood draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xRTKAg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zdJsxG"&gt;On cross-examination, Zachman testified to a number of corrective measures Theranos offered — which made the company sound like one of those Amazon sellers that begs you to remove your bad review. See, Zachman sat on the Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care board that evaluated new products. So Theranos offered to run, and did run, a study in 30 people comparing its results to those of Quest and a third party lab. Christian Holmes offered her his private email address and phone number. She was also offered a meeting with Elizabeth Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xQTM7"&gt;When the results came back from Theranos’ study, conducted with her employer, Zachman still didn’t refer patients to Theranos and says her colleagues largely didn’t either. The experience with Gould was so jarring to her — both as a healthcare provider and as a woman, she said — that the study couldn’t convince her to use the tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFOsIq"&gt;Gould didn’t use Theranos again, either. “You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results,” she said on the stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyVCpQ"&gt;But between October 2015 and October 2016, Theranos did another 300 hCG tests for patients at Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care, according to evidence from the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr1QBn"&gt;Obviously, the goal was to blunt the impact of Zachman’s testimony; the defense did not question Gould. The question the defense wanted the jurors to ask themselves, it seemed, was: “Would Theranos go above and beyond — with the study and so on — if it were really a fraud?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dRruj4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These documents were also used to point the finger at the lab directors &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXb5Tm"&gt;The morning’s testimony was in a similar vein: Surekha Gangakhedkar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;who’d formerly developed tests at Theranos&lt;/a&gt; and quit over her concerns about bringing those tests to patients, was cross-examined. First, the defense tried to establish that she’d done real, good work with drug companies Centocor and Celgene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nghfD"&gt;The defense also showed emails from Holmes congratulating Gangakhedkar on her work, one of which came at 12:20AM on a Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5LE5B"&gt;Then, to show that Theranos had taken its tests seriously, a number of documents were introduced that Gangakhedkar had signed off on. These reports detailed how the tests had been developed, and were voluminous. But those documents aren’t the same thing as what’s required to get approval for testing in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoYb8W"&gt;These documents were also used to point the finger at the lab directors as being ultimately responsible for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="M2RVKy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes was presented as the “good boss”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2Pj71"&gt;With Gangakhedkar, as with Zachman, Holmes was presented as the “good boss” who just wanted to get things right. It wasn’t just the kudos emails. Holmes approved a month-long vacation so Gangakhedkar could take her family to meet extended family in India. And when Gangakhedkar quit, Holmes tried to talk her out of it. Holmes offered a leave of absence, and asked if there was anything else she could do to make Gangakhedkar stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRwzuh"&gt;Balwani, by contrast, was painted as the “bad boss,” who had repeatedly downplayed Gangakhedkar’s team’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH7UwO"&gt;The testimony from Zachman and Gangakhedkar felt similar — when something went wrong, Theranos or Holmes tried to fix it. But one thing stood out: Gould didn’t have a similar story. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was the one most affected by the bad test results, not Zachman. And Theranos knew the bad results belonged to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uwSold"&gt;While Zachman was offered Christian Holmes’ phone number and a meeting with Elizabeth Holmes, Gould didn’t testify to anything similar. Maybe she just wasn’t important enough for Theranos to want to win over. After all, she was just a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$197 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/QObva3"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$153 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;Right now Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro for $49 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $151 in select colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4pY4R1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung only released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation — in late August, but we’re already starting to see some discounts at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for example, you can get a free Galaxy SmartTag tracker with the purchase of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B09FHRN4NT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The bundle is typically worth $180, however, Amazon is currently selling all styles for $150 instead — the same price the Galaxy Buds 2 normally retail for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748159989908648779#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/3Pk6Pr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live in a multitude of colors for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B7LX7N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1577733-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nznaxar_galaxy_buds_live_noise_canceling.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, a $60 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of headphones that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Typically $230, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $168, one of the best prices we’ve seen on the earbuds outside of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfB2WVItB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the price on the Elite 85t is still intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option. We consider the Jabra 75t — which are currently selling for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/WDNvBA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; — the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IE8ocy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; may be the latest fitness earbuds from Apple, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling the earphones in three colorways (red, yellow, and green) for $175.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; represent a tremendous value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. The $120 earbuds also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than the AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb3iGA"&gt;Although the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds were on sale for $90 during Amazon’s Labor Day sale, they’re currently not discounted anywhere. That said, we expect to see similar discounts later in the fall as we approach Black Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to fix Deathloop ‘stuttering’ issues on PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSKgq9V7V_faIif-gORFVpgmnAE=/429x0:2589x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885518/deathloop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EojSD0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the big triple-A game of the moment, and it’s an amazing experience — assuming you’re not fighting your gaming PC to get it to run smoothly. Bethesda is aware, and a patch seems to be on the way. But as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Alex Battaglia explains in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu_XHyO-6zY"&gt;this in-depth video&lt;/a&gt;, there may be a few things you can try right now to fix it, including one weird, counterintuitive trick that instantly made my seemingly stuttery performance smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfDENn"&gt;Also, there’s a new patch as of September 21st &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;that Bethesda says&lt;/a&gt; might &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; fix the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flFyMD"&gt;Here’s the TL;DR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x4UgO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Obvious:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce your quality settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lk2mRz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Also obvious: &lt;/strong&gt;Try the initial hotfix, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;now available in Steam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCrtfP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Counterintuitive: &lt;/strong&gt;Lock your framerate at 60 or 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ydt9Pq"&gt;Let’s start with that last one, because it’s what worked for me — and it may be the only thing that works if you’ve got a fancy G-Sync / FreeSync monitor with variable refresh rate. Simply go to the game’s &lt;strong&gt;Video Settings &lt;/strong&gt;page, turn off &lt;strong&gt;V-Sync&lt;/strong&gt; entirely, and set your &lt;strong&gt;FPS Limiter&lt;/strong&gt; to 60 or — if your performance is high enough — 120 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TTplP6vb5HA_GerONCujKTZhSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865395/deathloop_fps_limiter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down the video settings menu and you’ll find V-Sync and FPS Limiter. You’ll have to turn off V-Sync first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJjnuC"&gt;You might be asking: “Isn’t the whole point of V-Sync and my fancy VRR monitor to keep this sort of stutter from happening?” Yes, but as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;explains, what you’re seeing has more to do with mouse movement than syncing your GPU’s frames to your monitor’s refresh rate. This isn’t the tearing you see when frames hit in the middle of a refresh, or the microstutter you might have experienced when frames are delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm0oL8"&gt;In fact, Battaglia shows that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; can deliver excellent frame times — there’s just a mismatch when you’re turning your digital character’s head at non-standard refresh rates, like the ones your variable refresh monitor is &lt;em&gt;designed &lt;/em&gt;to provide. With an RTX 3080, my GPU could easily send 80 fps to my G-Sync monitor in many scenes at near-4K resolution, but locking it to 60 counterintuitively made everything feel far smoother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTiD7I"&gt;Another thing you might want to do (though you may also want to &lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after the next public patch: try the hotfix &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1438540739856715788"&gt;that Bethesda’s currently asking users to help test&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu8YA3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;As of September 21st&lt;/a&gt;, this may now be as easy as updating your game. Originally, you had to right click on &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; in your Steam library, select &lt;strong&gt;Properties &lt;/strong&gt;and then &lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;, type &lt;strong&gt;juliannashotme&lt;/strong&gt; into the access code field, hit &lt;strong&gt;Check Code&lt;/strong&gt;, then and &lt;strong&gt;Opt into&lt;/strong&gt; the public_beta branch that appears. Let us know if you see a difference between the beta and new patch?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOoYdaCHIyqHA1h6wwX-flwdCvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865439/Vqbx0fxvgO.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to hit Check Code and also Opt into before the beta hotfix will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gYDNFo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports the hotfix seems to smooth over one of the mouse issues, though Battaglia still points out other problems in his full video, including one where you may need to quit out of a mission or start the next level before it resolves itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvb9Y2"&gt;Lastly, it’s possible you’re just picking graphical settings that are unnecessarily high for what’s quite a demanding game. &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; looks great at High levels of detail, often with little noticeable difference compared to Very High or Ultra, as you can see in the video atop this post. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vh3sSu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DEATHLOOP PC players, we have released an update that addresses Steam achievements and adds descriptive error reporting for crashes on launch. We are also investigating reports of "stuttering" on PC, and are exploring fixes. More info:&lt;a href="https://t.co/uO6qu7Vrzb"&gt;https://t.co/uO6qu7Vrzb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DEATHLOOP (@deathloop) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1438540739856715788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The Oversight Board wants answers about Facebook’s celebrity moderation program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pbXdYtwFK0OkrXAH8FMn2A4hAhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890688/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTUrov"&gt;The Oversight Board, a semi-independent body that reviews Facebook’s moderation policies, &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/3056753157930994-to-treat-users-fairly-facebook-must-commit-to-transparency/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it wants more information about the “cross-check” system Facebook uses to “review content decisions relating to some high-profile users.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;Cross-check is getting called into question&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that claimed the system lets high-profile users break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WI9XTK"&gt;“In light of recent developments, we are looking into the degree to which Facebook has been fully forthcoming in its responses in relation to cross-check, including the practice of whitelisting,” the board writes. “We expect to receive a briefing from Facebook in the coming days and will be reporting what we hear from this as part of our first release of quarterly transparency reports, which we will publish in October.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p2ChUI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cross-check has the Oversight Board’s attention&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1v4RH"&gt;Cross-check (sometimes referred to as XCheck) is supposed to add an extra level of scrutiny to high-profile moderation calls that could cause controversy for Facebook. But the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;claims it covered a huge swathe of 5.8 million people in 2020, and only 10 percent of the posts sent to the program got reviewed by Facebook’s second layer of specialized moderators. According to the report, users included in the program include Senator Elizabeth Warren, conservative commentator Candace Owens, and former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwU8aC"&gt;Trump’s relative protection via cross-check came up &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ"&gt;in the board’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to uphold&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt; the former President’s Facebook ban&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the board noted that there’s limited public information about cross-check reviews — &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"&gt;a 2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most recent. It advised the company to “clearly explain the rationale, standards, and processes of review, including the criteria to determine which pages and accounts are selected for inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVUxAY"&gt;As with all Oversight Board actions, Facebook allows itself some flexibility in how to respond. The company has publicly committed to following the organization’s calls on individual moderation decisions but reserves the right to not follow broader recommendations. It’s also not legally bound to follow the board’s rules. With today’s announcement and renewed pressure to clarify a program with issues Facebook’s already working to address, maybe we’ll finally learn more about the controversial program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s new pan &amp; tilt cam can see everywhere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5BQo4PgCcoDl4klrpJa-GTDDPA=/25x0:4147x2748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890665/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThuMeH"&gt;Ubiquitous budget smart home company Wyze has released yet another new product — the &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-pan.html"&gt;Wyze Cam Pan v2&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies, this is the second generation of one of Wyze’s earliest products — the Wyze Cam Pan that debuted three years ago. This new model is available now, costs $39.99 (plus $9.99 shipping), and adds color night vision, improved motion-tracking, and a siren to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t00d3"&gt;There’s no change in form factor, and the Wyze Cam Pan v2 camera looks virtually identical to its (now-discontinued) predecessor. It’s a wired, indoor camera with 1080p HD video and two-way talk. But its main party trick is the ability to rotate on its base and capture a 360-degree view of your home from side-to-side and a 93-degree view vertically, so you can spot Spiderman when he crawls in through the skylight. A Pan Scan feature lets you set four custom waypoints that the camera continuously scans, so you’re sort of getting four cameras in one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bx8pufrzFwvOi7gE7KJI6xYI28s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868137/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze has refreshed one of its earliest products, the Wyze Cam Pan, adding color night vision and a siren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kACLqG"&gt;But the big feature is the introduction of color night vision — powered by a Starlight Sensor that first debuted in the Wyze Cam v3 indoor/outdoor camera. This adds the option to see the 1080p full HD video footage the camera captures at night in full color, instead of the grainy black and white of traditional night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fuyKR"&gt;Rather than relying on a built-in spotlight for color night vision, the sensor utilizes any available light to illuminate the scene more colorfully. Wyze says it can see in rooms as dark as 0.1 LUX (that’s very dark). If there’s not enough light, it can be set to automatically switch to standard black and white night vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLCpTt"&gt;Another improvement over the original model is a faster processor, which Wyze says enables its motion tracking feature to more quickly follow real-time movement. You can toggle this on or off in the Settings in the app, but when on, it will identify a moving object — such as a person or pet — and automatically track it. This is something that makes the original Wyze Cam Pan an excellent pet monitor, and the new model’s faster processor is likely even better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dp5qqit4jRA_lsZ0qbs7DQznQkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868151/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze Cam Pan v2 uses a Starlight Sensor to enhance night vision in lowlight conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QfR8x0"&gt;The two-way talk feature can also help you keep in touch with Fido or Felix while you’re at work or yell at an intruder. And now there’s a siren option, which you can activate in the Wyze app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KODm8u"&gt;The final new feature is invisible infrared lights. Anyone who’s ever tried to use a security camera as a baby monitor will know why this is key: the camera face will remain black in a dark room and not disturb any sleeping babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfcF6P"&gt;Included features that are also on Wyze’s other cams are local storage via a micro SD card (not included) that enables 24/7 recording, free 14-day rolling cloud storage of event-based videos, up to 12 seconds per clip, and the ability to listen for smoke and CO alarms. You can add longer clips and smart alerts for people, pets, vehicles, and packages with a Cam Plus subscription (starting at $1.25 a month, and you get one month free). All in, there are a lot of great specs and features here, in a tiny little camera, all for a pretty low price (although not as low as it used to be — the v1 started out at $30). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPR1lx"&gt;This is what Wyze is known for, rock bottom prices for close-to-top-of-the-line specs. But in reality, these features don’t always pan out. And sometimes, those that have been promised fail to materialize (Alexa and Google Assistant integration are on the way, says Wyze). We’ll check back with an update once we’ve tested the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHsIQX"&gt;But if this is the camera you’ve been waiting for, you might not want to wait any longer. The Wyze Pan Cam v2 is shipping now, and Wyze has had a fair amount of trouble keeping stuff in stock recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPu0RD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi will start streaming on November 12th as part of Disney Plus Day</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AgsH3Y"&gt;Disney is making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634609/marvel-shang-chi-ten-rings-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;available to stream at no additional cost for subscribers &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/walt-disney-company-celebrates-disney-plus-day-november-12"&gt;as part of its newly announced Disney Plus Day&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the second anniversary of Disney Plus on November 12th. Along with its latest Marvel blockbuster, the company is introducing new movies, shows, and Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; specials as part of “a grand-scale celebration of our subscribers across the entire company,” says Disney CEO Bob Chapek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfFmn6"&gt;Disney tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that both &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595789/jungle-cruise-review-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will be available to stream at no additional cost for subscribers on November 12th. (&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on Premiere Access; &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is only in theaters.) There will also be a special “celebrating the origins and legacy” of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’ &lt;/em&gt;Boba Fett, a special “celebrating the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Disney+ with an exciting look towards the future,” and a new &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; movie called &lt;em&gt;Home Sweet Home Alone.&lt;/em&gt; Other releases include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jx0xeJ"&gt;A new series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Olaf Presents&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YYVJSt"&gt;The streaming debut of beloved and award-winning shorts like &lt;em&gt;Frozen Fever,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paperman,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Get A Horse!,&lt;/em&gt; and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4SatK"&gt;A Pixar animated short called &lt;em&gt;Ciao Alberto&lt;/em&gt; starring characters from &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eqxHG3"&gt;A new short starring characters from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; that “pays tribute to Disney+’s marquee brands” (please just leave these characters alone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rTUNyB"&gt;And the first five episodes of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The World According to Jeff Goldblum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d5bjv5"&gt;Disney’s pandemic release strategy has been a mixed bag. Doing a day and date “Premiere Access” debut for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; resulted in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;ongoing lawsuit between Scarlett Johansson and the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise &lt;/em&gt;faired better, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22604674/jungle-cruise-disney-plus-premier-access-opening-revenues"&gt;reportedly earning a third of its opening revenue&lt;/a&gt; from Disney Plus. Chapek had stressed &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/shang-chi-disney-theatrical-day-and-date-bob-chapek-earnings-1234813885/"&gt;the flexibility of &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; premiering in theaters&lt;/a&gt; with its shorter 45-day theater exclusivity. That experiment seems to be paying off: &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/09/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-marvel-box-office-labor-day-1234662250/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi &lt;/em&gt;earned $90 million&lt;/a&gt; during Labor Day weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUNwoK"&gt;Disney Plus Day seems to mirror a similar strategy from Netflix, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;holding a fan event on the 25th&lt;/a&gt; to introduce new movies, trailers, and interviews with stars. These marketing events are an easy way to get fans to swallow a lot of ads, but they also drive eyes to services — something Disney likely wants &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-plus-slowdown-q4-subscribers-bob-chapek-1235070370/"&gt;if subscriber growth slows as Chapek predicts&lt;/a&gt;. Outside streaming, Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;has more theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt; on the way as well, including &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;in November and &lt;em&gt;West&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Side Story &lt;/em&gt;in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 Pro may have been leaked in a brief hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAHQ3fry4N3AD_R8tjhn_Eu_z2g=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890456/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVVTzX"&gt;Google got ahead of any possible news leaks about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;announcing the phones&lt;/a&gt; back in August, including that they would run on the company’s long-in-development Tensor chip. But it’s possible that some leakers have recently got hold of an actual unit. A video posted to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032"&gt;Twitter by @thisistechtoday&lt;/a&gt; may be showing off a pre-production version of the Pixel 6 Pro, complete with its triple rear camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCKvP"&gt;Of course, Google hasn’t been coy about sharing what the device will look like — even installing &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-look-google-puts-pixel-6-and-6-pro-on-display-at-its-nyc-store"&gt;dummy units in its NYC store for people to ogle&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the device that’s spun around in this short clip looks like what we’ve seen so far — the strange Google logo placeholder notwithstanding. The phone in this video appears to have a hole-punch selfie camera, and all of its buttons are located along its right edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G1CaYO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I think this may be the first hands on video leak of a Google Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI: The logo would indicate that this is likely an early production test unit, so that means there may be some differences between what you see here and the actual production device. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QSvdktqA7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4QSvdktqA7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hP7jt"&gt;Just like the Pixel 6 Pro renders that Google shared, the phone in this video appears to have a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_6uZBFl8F94sDwJAiydSFMAr4=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755095/Pixel_6_Pro_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;metallic and glossy rail&lt;/a&gt; surrounding its raised camera bar, as opposed to the Pixel 6’s &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGTDiRqYZ_v7B0qBMCPFTj6yxMo=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;darker, matte-textured &lt;/a&gt;rail. Admittedly, it’s tough to tell for sure in this footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWDObJ"&gt;So while it isn’t as if we haven’t seen what the phone looks like, what’s notable in this video is that the display is powered on, which is an angle on the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro that we &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; seen much of, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;outside of this new ad&lt;/a&gt;. Admittedly, though, it’s a rather boring glimpse, showing the same screen you see during the Android 12 setup process. The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA26HW"&gt;We still don’t know exactly when Google plans to fully take the wraps off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro or when it will share prices and a release date. But it ought to be soon, perhaps sometime in October, if previous years are any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At pivotal points in human spaceflight, NASA undergoes major reorganization </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX And NASA Prepare For Next Launch Attempt On Saturday, After Weather Delays Wednesday Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Xa0SIIWHq5JZHiSZDVl6oD4-Ho=/33x0:3000x1978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890291/1227593491.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOCGlv"&gt;The body of NASA tasked with managing human spaceflight is being split into two distinct directorates, the agency’s chief announced on Tuesday, embarking on a major reorganization that past officials have tried and failed to execute for years. The move comes as private companies like SpaceX demonstrate leaner methods of putting people in space and as NASA pushes ahead with ambitious plans to build settlements on the surface of the Moon in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi8IRI"&gt;The breakup of NASA’s human exploration wing, called Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, will spawn two new bodies: first, the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, which will manage NASA’s most ambitious development programs like the Artemis program that are still in formative and testing phases. The second will be the Space Operations Mission Directorate, which will handle more routine, operational programs like the International Space Station and the Commercial Crew Program. Agency officials say categorizing programs based on levels of development rather than areas of expertise will help refine NASA’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGp4mX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two heads are better than one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0BbX7G"&gt;The organizational shakeup was a “strong” recommendation from President Biden’s transition team, Nelson told reporters during a press conference on the changes. One major advantage of the change involves NASA’s budgeting process, which is often fraught with complexity and frequently faces pushback from members of Congress who complain NASA doesn’t provide enough clarity on its exploration plans. With the broad human exploration program now split in two, complex and sometimes ambiguous programs won’t be as intermixed with NASA’s more routine programs. And the two bodies will have separate leaders rather than a single official whose workload has seen steep growth in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1rWW99bvkNKPxDL5jdB6mNTs_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867738/51399128214_36009d4571_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;(NASA/Bill Ingalls)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, will now lead a new directorate focused on space operations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fQfBmw"&gt;“Two heads are better than one,” Kathy Lueders, the current head of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, said during a town hall in Washington, DC, with the agency’s workforce on Tuesday. Lueders, who previously led NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, will move from her post as human spaceflight chief to helm the Space Operations Mission Directorate. Jim Free, a former deputy associate administrator who held senior roles in NASA’s Orion capsule program, will lead the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcbdqU"&gt;But not everyone in the space industry will be happy with the change. Lueders, seen by many as a champion for commercial space because of her experience leading the Commercial Crew Program during its formative years, won’t be as involved in the agency’s biggest development programs like Artemis anymore. Critics of the reorganization are also likely to see it as more red tape and a new burden of coordination between the two offices that will have to stay in touch on related space programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcYu7W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“as easy of a decision as falling off a log”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdIgNP"&gt;“We’re actually not adding a whole new layer of people,” NASA deputy administrator Pam Melroy told reporters after the town hall, addressing critiques of the move. “There are very few additional positions that will be required... the challenges that we have in coordinating across organizations is exactly the same as it is today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="496HUu"&gt;“Both of these people are extremely qualified,” Nelson told reporters. “It was obvious, it was common sense, that Kathy’s success should continue in the space operations mission directorate.” Employing a southern colloquialism, he added his decision to pick Lueders and Free for the roles “was as easy of a decision as falling off a log.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8kXMW"&gt;Studies conducted by NASA’s senior leadership under the Trump administration, when Nelson’s predecessor Jim Bridenstine was leading NASA, recommended a similar idea: NASA should spin-off elements related to its ambitious Artemis program into a separate directorate with its own leadership, giving it the focus and resources it’d need to execute an ambitious timeline of putting astronauts on the Moon by 2024. That advice was shelved at the time, current and former officials say, partially because it subtracted resources from other directorates, which frustrated members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPnKgM"&gt;But now, growing activity in the commercial space arena and the increasing cadence of human space travel, as SpaceX’s recent all-civilian mission to orbit last week showed, warrant changes to how NASA has managed its biggest human spaceflight programs for nearly a decade, NASA’s senior leadership say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="20yM5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJkDjk"&gt;“The last decade has seen extraordinary change and growth,” Melroy said at the town hall. “The impact that NASA has had on commercial space has created new capabilities that we didn’t even know we could rely on.” Citing future development plans with NASA’s long-delayed and over-budget Space Launch System, which is poised to launch for the first time later this year or early next year, Melroy added: “This is exactly the time for us to take a deep breath and say, ‘Wow, we have a chain of development programs, no longer just one monolithic program. How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgxG2"&gt;NASA’s Artemis program includes a wide range of technologies that fall under the now-decentralized human exploration directorate. SpaceX is developing its Starship system to send NASA’s first astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024 (that will probably get delayed). A new space station called Gateway that will orbit the Moon is in the works by a team of international partners. Lockheed Martin is building NASA’s Orion crew capsule to help astronauts get to the Moon. NASA’s Space Launch System, a behemoth rocket largely managed by Boeing, has been under construction for more than a decade to launch the Orion capsule to Gateway, where SpaceX’s Starship will pick up astronauts and land on the lunar surface. Artemis is a multibillion-dollar fandango, and until today, all of it sat next to other routine programs like the ISS, a $100 billion orbital research post that has housed rotating crews of international astronauts for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRFYTy"&gt;“This approach allows one mission directorate to operate in space, while the other builds space systems,” Melroy said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus announces new streaming bundle with Showtime included</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oq7oCIktf5EbPocBStxir0Mk8Dg=/32x0:992x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890216/ParamountPlus_Showtime_Hero_1024x640.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZi8L7"&gt;Paramount Plus announced today that it’s launching a new streaming bundle for both its ad-supported and premium tiers that include Showtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcanPs"&gt;Paramount Plus offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;two subscription options&lt;/a&gt;: a pared-down essential plan with limited ads for $5 per month and an ad-free premium plan for $10 per month. ViacomCBS’s Showtime is offering the bundle at special introductory pricing of $10 per month and $13 per month, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfmTG8"&gt;Like other services similarly looking to lure subscribers by offering, for example, limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685091/netflix-free-android-plan-kenya"&gt;free-to-stream content&lt;/a&gt; or slashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544099/apple-tv-plus-one-year-free-ending-three-months"&gt;promotional pricing&lt;/a&gt;, Paramount Plus hopes the package will help it win new customers. Tom Ryan, president and CEO of ViacomCBS streaming, said the company expects the “competitively priced bundle to only further expand the reach of both services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9x59t"&gt;It is, to be clear, a pretty good deal — at least at the bundle’s promotional pricing. Showtime’s own ad-free streaming service costs $11 a month after a 30-day trial period. It’s unclear how much the bundle will cost after the introductory fees, though. A spokesperson said post-promo would be announced at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWPh6W"&gt;In any event, if you do happen to be paying for Paramount Plus and are looking to swipe Showtime at a pretty steep discount, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvuWwU"&gt;iOS 15 is finally here, and while it can’t be called a revolutionary update, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;enough cool new features&lt;/a&gt; that you may not want to wait until Apple notifies you that the update is ready. It’s easy enough to get the update without waiting, though. Here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JN0zOp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;Your phone is backed up&lt;/a&gt;, right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdmYBQ"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7duHTw"&gt;Give it a moment. If the update is ready for you, it may appear on your update screen. In that case, tap on “Install Now.” You’ll probably be asked for your passcode and will have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwBlhb7wPAfb-e43zShyRdsfrgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867904/IMG_0B14C4232371_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqhwew1GrHnrbZIA-mooQyPfI3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867905/IMG_A3F1E73A0B91_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="elnD7Z"&gt;If you don’t see the update, look toward the bottom and tap on “Upgrade to iOS 15” &amp;gt; “Download and Install.” (The latter may appear automatically.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BUQygG"&gt;Type in your passcode if prompted, agree to those “Terms and Conditions,” and wait while the upload begins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OK6qhj"&gt;It will take a while to update your iPhone. So put the phone down, go do something relaxing, and then come back in a little while to your brand new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
