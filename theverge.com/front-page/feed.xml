    <title>Twitter plans to let anyone start hosting Twitter Spaces in April</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OTOJn4"&gt;If you opened your phone this morning to see a Twitter app update, you might have been excited — and then confused — to see an advertisement for Twitter Spaces, the audio chat rooms that the social network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;recently launched to compete with the similar Clubhouse app&lt;/a&gt;. “Introducing Spaces,” the iOS update says, promising that “Now you can Tweet and Talk.” But while you won’t actually find the ability to create a new Space unless you’re one of a select few, the company now says it’s planning to launch Spaces to everyone next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLCapr"&gt;Amusingly, we overheard the news &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1369719689958592520"&gt;in a Twitter Space itself&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by the company. Twitter’s plans aren’t set in stone, but the gist is that they’re trying to get the product into a state where anyone can host a Twitter Space starting in April. April is the goal. In the meanwhile, users on both iOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;and Android&lt;/a&gt; can both join and talk in existing Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqtymI"&gt;Twitter Spaces are just one of an array of new features the typically feature-resistant company has announced in the past few months, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;we’ve got a wide-ranging interview with Twitter product head Kayvon Beykpour&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses the whole set, including the company’s Snap and Instagram-like disappearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21573380/twitter-fleets-launch-stories-spaces-future"&gt;Twitter Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt; where you can pay to subscribe to extra Twitter content from your favorite creators — a business which reminds us of platforms like Substack and OnlyFans. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook moves to dismiss the US government’s antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GShPB6KxOkkd1PSRmHU8it9489U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943495/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Todebl"&gt;In two motions filed Wednesday, Facebook called on the courts to dismiss a pair of &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/motions-to-dismiss-ftc-state-ag-lawsuits/"&gt;sweeping competition cases&lt;/a&gt; brought on by the federal government and a coalition of states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47IWqV"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission and a group of state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed separate lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook last December accusing the tech giant of engaging in anti-competitive behavior. The two lawsuits make similar claims, alleging that Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in order to squash the threat the two apps posed to the company’s business. Additionally, the attorneys general accused Facebook of using its market dominance to stifle the growth of competing services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWvO0S"&gt;The FTC’s case also calls for the courts to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Aalag"&gt;In Facebook’s motion to dismiss the cases, it claims the lawsuits allege that the two nascent apps were “potential” competitors, rather than a pressing and actual threat to Facebook’s business. The FTC declined to comment. The New York Attorney General’s office, one of the states leading the second case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9nP3qf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These complaints do not credibly claim that our conduct harmed either”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7TcAN"&gt;“Antitrust laws are intended to promote competition and protect consumers,” Facebook said in a blog post Wednesday. “These complaints do not credibly claim that our conduct harmed either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKMeaB"&gt;Because the FTC cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions at the time, Facebook also argues that the commission doesn’t have sufficient grounds to reverse that decision. “Facebook is aware of no comparable, much less successful, challenge by the FTC to a long-completed acquisition that the FTC itself cleared,” Facebook’s filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEwHP"&gt;Facebook is at the center of a series of antitrust investigations brought on by the federal government, states, and Congress. Last month, the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust held its first hearing on tech dominance after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;16-month probe&lt;/a&gt; into companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. That investigation prompted a report from Democrats calling for structural remedies to Facebook’s business, potentially leading to a breakup. The hearing marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;the last leg of the committee’s work&lt;/a&gt;, holding a second series of hearings on how to reform US antitrust law as it’s applied to tech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wT6K2Q"&gt;Committees in both the House and Senate plan to hold hearings this week, and new legislation is expected to land before the end of spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7REh2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends is out on the Switch, but it’s missing a key feature: cross-progression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcRONyLSx4Plg6Fx7O7m_QQb7vo=/200x0:2339x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943479/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_1.29.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMpowt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/apex-legends-switch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the latest major cross-platform Switch port. After years of availability on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, EA has finally brought the battle royale shooter to Nintendo’s handheld console, adding a fresh wave of players to the mix and a new, on-the-go option for existing &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; fans. But there’s a glaring issue with the Switch port: right now, there’s no cross-progression, making the Switch port effectively a nonstarter for dedicated players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UvCY7t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apex Legends won’t dethrone Fortnite, but there’s still nothing like it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286834/apex-legends-review-ps4-xbox-pc-fortnite-battle-royale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hqFu5W"&gt;At launch, the new Nintendo Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; offers cross-platform gameplay — meaning that you can play with and against players on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in addition to other Switch players. But any progress or purchases that players have made on those other platforms won’t carry over. Effectively, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; players on the Switch are starting from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VJgjq"&gt;Despite the “Season 8” branding that covers &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, there’s no continuity for players on the Switch version — so much so, that players have to replay the tutorial before they’ll actually be able to drop into a full match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueN7ZJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/03/feature_panic_button_and_respawn_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_apex_legends_on_switch"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chad Grenier (Respawn’s game director for &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;) said that cross-progression is planned for the future, but with the caveat that “we’re a ways out from being able to offer that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UtfKH7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re a ways out from being able to offer [cross-progression].”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnsqcz"&gt;Grenier explains that there are a mix of issues preventing Respawn from offering cross-progression, with contractual, legal, and technical problems that need to be sorted out. “It’s a complex challenge of multiple accounts existing for various users that we have to resolve or merge, there are legal and contractual things to navigate with purchasing on other platforms and having those carryover and also some technical challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khN8SN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; is by no means the first mainstream game to run into this issue. Unfortunately, the lack of cross-progression is more common than not for most cross-platform games, both on the Switch and on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKvqrT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919715/overwatch-switch-port-review-impressions-blizzard-nintendo-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has been struggling with the lack of cross-platform progression and gameplay for years, despite the emphasis that Blizzard puts on cosmetic content unlocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TU0P99"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; has been ported to plenty of platforms since its launch, including Amazon’s Luna, a cloud-based version for the Nintendo Switch, and a next-gen version for PS5 and Xbox One. But there’s no crossover for saves between those titles — if you started &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; on a PS4, then that’s where your save is stuck forever, even if you want to try streaming it from an internet service or playing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260905/control-ps5-next-gen-hands-on-preview"&gt;fancier graphics on a next-gen console&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdvLQV"&gt;Obviously, there are real technical and legal issues here. &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s skins are heavily tied to its loot box economy, which are all purchased through the platform-specific stores, which can complicate things. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;’s lack of next-gen saves are tied to updates to the game engine that prevented Remedy from offering continuity for existing players. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nUz9S3s0CI20SFYnad4YhCcKKo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360105/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_1.29.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g2k53l"&gt;But there’s also a wealth of games in 2021 that show that a better way is possible. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332925/rocket-league-free-to-play-psyonix-epic-game-store-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the gold standard here: simply log into Epic’s free-to-play games on your platform of choice, and all your stuff is there waiting for you. You can play with friends on any platform (well, except iOS), from any platform, with all of your skins, emotes, items, and unlocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezJFOA"&gt;And even recent Ubisoft games have added cross-play and cross-progression through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527273/ubisoft-connect-crossplay-cross-saves-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;Ubisoft Connect&lt;/a&gt;, letting players start playing sprawling RPGs like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319059/assassins-creed-valhalla-hands-on-preview-pc-xbox-one-ps4-gameplay-ubisoft-rpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on one system and continue on another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnv9bR"&gt;In 2021, offering cross-progression and cross-play is increasingly becoming table stakes for major games. With massive titles that can take dozens, if not hundreds of hours of players’ time, locking down progression to a single console or platform just doesn’t make sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gJOQ0j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When in-game items are the whole point, it’s essential to make them available everywhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rZXWmW"&gt;And that’s doubly true for free-to-play games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, which live or die on the strength and size of their multiplayer community and the money that they can make off selling cosmetic items. When your game is free to download on any platform, it’s critical that the time and money that players invest into getting those digital rewards be consistent across those platforms, because the collection of those items is the main reward structure of those games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwI0ty"&gt;Bungie figured that out a while ago, back when it transitioned &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; to a free-to-play title — it now&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;allows players to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828271/destiny-2-how-to-cross-save-game-pc-xbox-ps4-steam-battlenet"&gt;sync their in-game items&lt;/a&gt; to whatever platform they’re playing on (even if Bungie is still working out cross-platform gameplay). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3gaQj"&gt;The whole point of putting a game like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch is to offer players another avenue to play the game. Sure, it may attract some new players, but for many others it’s a way to spend even more time with a game they already love. But by locking things like hero characters or items that players have painstakingly unlocked through time or money to a single platform, the game is still stuck in an outdated model of game design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWnBbZ"&gt;Players have a finite amount of time. And why would you open up &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; to unlock all your old gear again when you pick up your Switch when you could make progress on your &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle pass — a far more substantial unlock that isn’t tethered to a single system — instead? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t invest in SPACs just because of celebrity endorsements, SEC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shaq wearing Magic Leap One headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-eQTLRNW4O66hvYItDNGdy7dWY=/69x0:980x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943386/Screen_Shot_2018_02_13_at_7.55.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/9/16997086/how-to-watch-live-livestream-rony-abovitz-magic-leap-adam-silver-nba-augmented-reality-code-media" target="_blank"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnNtav"&gt;Today, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has found the growing trend of celebrity-endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)&lt;/a&gt; dangerous enough &lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/celebrity"&gt;to warn investors in a new statement&lt;/a&gt;: just because a celebrity is participating in or endorsing a SPAC, doesn’t mean you should invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf483W"&gt;The terminology can be complicated, but the SEC’s advice is fairly simple. Like if any stranger recommended you invest in a business (in this case, one trying to merge with other companies to take them public), there are a lot of unknowns that should be accounted for. “Celebrities, like anyone else, can be lured into participating in a risky investment,” writes the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. Celebrities, many already being wealthy and successful, “may be better able to sustain the risk of loss.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UzGGJO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Celebrity endorsements don’t make investments any safer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEb5XP"&gt;Additionally, as part of the deal to be an initial investor or sponsor for a SPAC, celebrities might have economic arrangements that are different from the average shareholder. As much as I’d want to trust Papa John’s board member and basketball star Shaquille O’Neal’s choice in acquiring a specific “audience aggregation platform” (something &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/10/20/shaq-moves-into-spacs-with-former-disney-execs--mlk-jrs-son/?sh=41ae8a7c6c77"&gt;he’s apparently looking to get into&lt;/a&gt;), he might be earning far more than you or I ever will off our likely riskier investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kLYyYK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“The rapid increase in the volume of SPACs represents a significant change and we are taking a hard look at the disclosures and other structural issues surrounding SPACs,” said John Coates, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3SYLtF2ehj"&gt;https://t.co/3SYLtF2ehj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SEC_News (@SEC_News) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_News/status/1369669846670209027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snBBtf"&gt;The timing for this warning (noted in the tweet above) is directly connected to the exponential growth in the interest in SPACs, from bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266661/genetic-health-23andme-public-spac-richard-branson"&gt;23andMe public&lt;/a&gt; to basically swallowing every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;electric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; you’ve heard of. The SEC has seen fit to step in to warn investors and caution celebrities in these kinds of situations in the past, specifically requiring stars to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597870/sec-warns-celebrities-endorsement-ico-cryptocurrency"&gt;disclose how much they’re compensated&lt;/a&gt; to advertise cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj3guA"&gt;SPACs aren’t going away, and in a culture where many wealthy celebrities are also wealthy investors — or where investors like Chamath Palihapitiya &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-spac-man-chamath-palihapitiya-speaks-reddit-and-wall-street-listen-11615006818"&gt;can wield celebrity-like influence&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chamath-palihapitiya-sells-virgin-galactic-spce-stake.html"&gt;a company and its accompanying value&lt;/a&gt; — seeing past the glamour and bluster is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUpwaQ"&gt;“Even if a celebrity is involved in a SPAC, investing in one may not be a good idea for you. Before investing, always do your research,” writes the SEC. We all want, nay, &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be friends with Shaq, but that doesn’t mean our money needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tFllp"&gt;Microsoft is updating its store for Xbox and Xbox Game Pass to include language support, the company &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/10/discover-games-on-xbox-in-your-preferred-language/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. The Languages label is meant to make it “easier to decide if you’d like to purchase or play that title” by including information on the game’s interface, audio, and subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ID2o9D"&gt;Whatever language console owners have set as their default will display first. The feature applies to 27 languages and displays how localization has been applied to various parts of the game, such as controls, subtitles, or spoken dialogue. “We’ve already added language tags to hundreds of games and will add more over time,” the announcement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmEDit"&gt;Fans have previously &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/dear-xbox-if-you-want-reach-2-billion-gamers-you-need-fix-your-localization"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s handling of localization, specifically outside of the US. As reported by &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;, players in territories like South Korea have documented which games support Korean languages. Platforms like Nintendo and Steam already support language guides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrDKHD"&gt;Microsoft will continue to add updates later this year to “make it even easier for you to find and play games that are right for you.” The company did not specify what those changes would look like. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon withholds its ebooks from libraries because it prefers you pay it instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t60rOpIo0uJ9K1qMMEjY4m40X4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943228/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lfLnWD"&gt;Amazon is withholding ebook and audiobook versions of works it publishes through its in-house publishing arms from US libraries, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/amazon-library-ebook-monopoly/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Amazon is the only major publisher that’s doing this, the report states. It’s doing so because the company thinks the terms involved with selling digital versions of books to libraries, which in turn make them available to local residents for free through ebook lending platforms like Libby, are unfavorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwORnG"&gt;“It’s not clear to us that current digital library lending models fairly balance the interests of authors and library patrons,” Mikyla Bruder, the global marketing chief at Amazon Publishing, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s Geoffrey Fowler in an emailed statement. “We see this as an opportunity to invent a new approach to help expand readership and serve library patrons, while at the same time safeguarding author interests, including income and royalties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xKa8P"&gt;At the heart of the issue is a debate over whether libraries, which often pay far higher than retail price for physical and ebook copies of books, ultimately harm publisher sales by letting people check out copies for free. In the age of mobile apps and widespread Kindle usage, borrowing an ebook is now easier than ever — you need a library card and the Libby app, and you can then place holds and eventually check out ebooks that can be sent directly to your Kindle e-reader or app to access for a limited time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cDDitd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not clear to us that current digital library lending models fairly balance the interests of authors and library patrons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IW7N21"&gt;Yet publishers, not authors, decide the fate of a book’s various distribution deals, and Amazon apparently does not want libraries lending its ebooks, at least not under whatever terms have been discussed. That means many of the authors the company has signed onto its publishing imprints — like Mindy Kaling, Trevor Noah, Andy Weir, and Michael Pollan — are available to read only if you pay the full retail price. That’s true when those same authors have expressed support for libraries and free book lending, as Pollan has to &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4uEU"&gt;Amazon is reportedly negotiating with a nonprofit, the Digital Public Library of America, to coordinate the selling of its ebooks to libraries, but &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;notes that the deal would not include any self-published works or Audible audiobooks. And making matters worse, Amazon is allegedly not negotiating — and hasn’t for years — a serious deal with OverDrive, the maker of the Libby app that’s used by many libraries around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrvKF6"&gt;Instead, OverDrive CEO Steve Potash tells &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;the company and Amazon have an &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;ongoing dialogue” in which OverDerive has communicated its “willingness to innovate in an effort to support their business strategy.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmyAbT"&gt;As Fowler notes in his report, six of the top 10 ebooks sold on Amazon, the dominant ebook platform in the US, were published by Amazon, making them ineligible for library loans because Amazon won’t sell them. Amazon does sell physical copies of books it publishes to libraries (when it’s not running ebook-exclusive promotions), Fowler notes, but the coronavirus pandemic has made Libby and ebook lending a vital source for those interested in borrowing books from the safety of their home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90zul4"&gt;“The eBook titles from Amazon Publishing are not available to libraries for lending at any price or any terms. By contrast, consumers may purchase all of these titles directly from Amazon,” argued the nonprofit American Library Association in October 2019 as part of a &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/news/sites/ala.org.news/files/content/mediapresscenter/CompetitionDigitalMarkets.pdf"&gt;congressional testimony&lt;/a&gt; detailing the dangers of publishers’ tightening grip on library access. “This is a particularly pernicious new form of the digital divide; the Amazon Publishing books are available only to people who can afford to buy them, without the library alternative previously available to generations of Americans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1STtw1"&gt;Amazon’s longstanding decision to prevent libraries from lending its ebooks underscores the company’s immense influence in the world of bookselling and publishing. The company became the dominant online seller of books in the US many years ago, and it cemented that dominance with the Kindle line of e-readers and eventually a robust multifaceted publishing platform for both professional writers and self-publishing authors that includes numerous imprints under the larger Amazon Publishing umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="g56emx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a particularly pernicious new form of the digital divide.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="equOpz"&gt;Amazon’s power in the bookselling and publishing worlds has created a contentious relationship between the company and authors, traditional publishers, and various other links in the publishing chain, most notably when Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7214703/amazon-hachette-resolve-ebooks-dispute"&gt;engaged in a high-profile and often bitter licensing negotiation&lt;/a&gt; with major book publisher Hachette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq1tPL"&gt;Many of these disputes can be drawn back to arguments over the digital distribution of ebooks — specifically the thorny mess surrounding ebook pricing, royalties, and secondary distribution like lending and reselling or sharing. Perhaps you remember the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc."&gt;landmark 2010 antitrust case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; and its book publisher partners over price fixing. It led to a stunning victory for Amazon and sanctioned its strategy of pricing ebooks lower than hardcover and paperbacks, against the wishes of the publishers that felt they had no choice but to sell on the dominant US e-commerce platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07TCMP"&gt;In this case, Amazon is again setting its own terms and using its dominance as a major US bookseller and publisher to break from industry norms. But instead of lowering prices for customers, which arguably won Amazon public favor in its antitrust fight against Apple and the major book publishers a decade ago, the company is withholding books from libraries. These are often underfunded public institutions geared toward providing access to knowledge and resources to children, the poor, and homeless individuals. But for Amazon, there is apparently a better deal to be had, leaving library users in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook adds a path to partnership for its Level Up creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfIiMIsHT-Yu9oNuvKDxvCM0xcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942912/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aKsdpL"&gt;Facebook Gaming has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/622800001735064"&gt;path to partnership&lt;/a&gt; for streamers in its Level Up creators program, which is the site’s equivalent of Twitch’s affiliates. It’s pretty grueling, and eligibility isn’t judged on the same metrics as its Level Up program, which allows streamers to start monetizing their broadcasts. Partners, however, get a slew of benefits, including a direct line to Facebook’s support team, a private Facebook Gaming community group, partner-only invites to Facebook Gaming events, a partner badge, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2478459059124998"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFksB5"&gt;Streamers in the Level Up program, on the other hand, are able to monetize their streams with Facebook Stars, a site currency, and fan subscriptions; they also get features like high-quality transcoding (i.e., 1080p 60fps streams) and access to beta products and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YihCPU"&gt;To be eligible for the Level Up program, gaming creators on Facebook have to stream games for four hours in the prior two weeks on at least two separate days in that same period. They also need at least 100 followers on a page that’s been active for more than two weeks. The admin of said page needs to be older than 18. These metrics are pretty reasonable and just about comparable to Twitch’s program metrics for its affiliate program (reach 50 followers, stream for eight hours on seven different days, with an average of three viewers in a one-month period). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SoqBHh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program is judged on “engaged followers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuqRQj"&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program, on the other hand, is judged on “engaged followers” — Facebook’s way of tracking the people who regularly return to your stream — and Stars revenue. To be considered for the partnership program, a gaming creator needs to have 3,000 engaged followers and earn $2,000 (200,000 stars) in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt1wAU"&gt;Twitch’s partnership program has different requirements: streamers must broadcast for 25 hours on 12 different days with an average of 75 viewers in a month. It also has a reputation for being notoriously difficult to achieve. Those metrics seem fairly reasonable on their face, but in practice, it’s hard to hit those numbers &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;get Twitch to approve your application. &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; streamers apply more than once before making it into &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;the 27,000-strong club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK8wFK"&gt;What’s most interesting about Facebook’s partnership requirements is that they didn’t have a clear path to being verified as a gaming creator on the site before; it’s also fascinating that there are just two requirements, and one is tied explicitly to how much money a creator earns on the site. ($2,000 works out to about 200,000 bits or 800 $5 subscriptions — Twitch takes a 50 percent cut.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x46EHM"&gt;A spokesperson for Facebook Gaming told me in an email that more than 2,000 creators earn at least $1,000 a month on the site, though they presumably are including the current slate of Facebook Gaming partners — streamers like Cory “King Gothalion” Michael, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936859/mixer-twitch-king-gothalion-shroud-ninja"&gt;who left Twitch for an exclusive Mixer deal&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019 and who then moved to Facebook Gaming after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300245/mixer-failed-microsoft-social-media-instagram-streaming"&gt;Mixer shut down&lt;/a&gt; — in those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJrdOf"&gt;Some Level Up streamers will absolutely hit Facebook’s numbers for partnership immediately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the requirements become less onerous over time. After all, back in 2015, streamers on Twitch used to have to average more than 500 concurrents a stream to be considered for partnership. As one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/382yab/twitchs_very_high_requirement_to_be_a_partner/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from that era lamented: “500... 500 viewers on average, every time you stream. This seems an almost impossibility? Anyone had experience with twitch partnering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXk9Z0"&gt;While they still stream — and cast and produce &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; tournaments — they still haven’t made partner. It’s important to remember that the creator economy is just as unequal as the real one. By Twitch’s own count, there are now around 27,000 partners on its site. &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;But that’s out of 2,000,000 other active broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fjJsw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWJ2rT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taDk8x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJudr1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia releases teaser images of its next electric car, the EV6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4Q0dQrFUXqlYIjJ1FH6BWSIBbc=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942902/kwcms_620x466_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Kia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OTpnL"&gt;Kia has given its next electric vehicle a name and is getting ready to pull the cover off the new car sometime within the next few weeks. Dubbed “EV6,” it’ll be the first electric vehicle that Kia is building on the new platform it’s sharing with parent company Hyundai — the same platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;Apple was reportedly interested in using&lt;/a&gt; to power... whatever it’s building before talks with the Korean automakers broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIJegZ"&gt;Kia released a few images of the car viewed off-angle from the sides, which reveal that the EV6 has a sort of hatchback-style shape. There’s a close-up image of a taillight, which appears to run across the entire rear of the car — a choice that’s becoming quite common in electric vehicle designs. Kia &lt;a href="https://www.kia.com/eu/about-kia/ev6/"&gt;also released a video with shots&lt;/a&gt; of the taillight illuminating, as well as one of the EV6’s headlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yr2zmd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10384503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dayVyp"&gt;The EV6 is the second electric vehicle to be recently announced that’s being built on the shared platform, which is called E-GMP. The other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;was Hyundai’s Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt;, which broke cover in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vtApEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hyundai’s electric Ioniq 5 crossover could be the ultimate camping companion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zG5B1"&gt;Kia says the EV6 is also the first to use the company’s new naming convention for its electric cars, which will each be called “EV” and given a number corresponding to their place in the lineup. The EV6 is supposed to get a full reveal sometime in the first quarter of 2021, according to Kia, which means it’s likely right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Miami Heat suspends Meyers Leonard for using slur during Twitch stream</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I84eno"&gt;The Miami Heat has suspended Meyers Leonard indefinitely after he used an anti-Semitic slur during a Twitch stream on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx8R43"&gt;“The Miami Heat vehemently condemns the use of any form of hate speech,” the NBA team wrote in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1369483385882689541"&gt;Twitter statement on Tuesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. “The words used by Meyers Leonard were wrong and we will not tolerate hateful language from anyone associated with our franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KIV389"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/f8rLKCkS5i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f8rLKCkS5i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1369483385882689541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zu1rcW"&gt;In a statement apologizing for his actions &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMN-G35DdD9/"&gt;posted to Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, Leonard says he wasn’t aware of the meaning of the slur when he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIxkf"&gt;“While I didn’t know what the word meant at the time, my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong,” he said. “I am now more aware of its meaning and I am committed to properly seeking out people who can help educate me about this type of hate and how we can fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="st8etE"&gt;The NBA also issued a statement, saying it “unequivocally condemns all forms of hate speech,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F31034606%2Fnba-looking-miami-heat-center-meyers-leonard-use-anti-semitic-slur&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a spokesperson told ESPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbDSYj"&gt;Twitch has suspended Leonard, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not allow the use of hateful slurs on Twitch,” Twitch said in a statement. “The safety of our community is our top priority, and per our guidelines we reserve the right to suspend any account for conduct that we determine to be inappropriate, harmful, or puts our community at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdEPW8"&gt;Other organizations have distanced themselves from Leonard as well. Gaming and esports organization FaZe Clan, which Leonard had &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6521800750388121605%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;invested in&lt;/a&gt;, said on Tuesday evening that it had severed ties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2t4XvT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A statement from FaZe Clan. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePo1NGEaN5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ePo1NGEaN5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Clan (@FaZeClan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeClan/status/1369435605034295302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pARAx"&gt;And sponsors Origin PC and Scuf Gaming, which are both owned by Corsair, have also said they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ORIGINPC/status/1369400143448006657"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScufGaming/status/1369400178109779986"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt; their working relationships with Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbDCwx"&gt;While stars saying inappropriate things on stream is relatively new territory for NBA players who dabble in streaming, it’s an unfortunately common problem for the biggest names on Twitch. Turner “Tfue” Tenney, for example, was suspended in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/faze-tfue-fortnite-twitch-banned-30-days-notvivid-934858"&gt;for using a racial slur on stream&lt;/a&gt;, though the platform did not take action when he said a different slur &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849429/fortnite-streamer-tfue-racial-slur-twitch-silence"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pro Daniel “Dubs” Walsh &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/fortnite-pro-dubs-banned-from-twitch-after-using-racial-slur"&gt;was banned&lt;/a&gt; from Twitch and suspended from FaZe Clan after saying a racial slur in February 2020. (He has since been reinstated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp2pOa"&gt;Other celebrities who have tried their hand at streaming have faced real-world consequences for hurtful language as well. NASCAR driver Kyle Larson was fired by his team in April for using the n-word &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21219793/nascar-kyle-larson-slur-iracing-suspended-sim-racing"&gt;during a sim racing stream&lt;/a&gt;, while musician Joel Zimmerman, who you might know as deadmau5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223380/deadmau5-joel-zimmerman-deletes-twitch-homophobic-slur-suspension-hateful-conduct-controversy"&gt;deleted his Twitch channel in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after he was suspended for saying homophobic slurs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox and PS5 game updates are bringing great choice to console gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loseIWK7NINEWsIc5JvT3B_s-4c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942777/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jx8RPW"&gt;The Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles haven’t even reached the six-month mark yet, but game modes that favor performance or visual quality are already common. It feels like not a week goes by without a game getting an update to allow players to pick between a demanding 4K resolution or sacrificing some resolution and quality for 60fps or even 120fps modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XJSaG"&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260905/control-ps5-next-gen-hands-on-preview"&gt;big next-gen update was &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with modes for both performance and visual quality. Today, it’s &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-retail-patch-notes-%E2%80%93-march-9-2021/593440"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; with choices&lt;/a&gt; that let you pick between a 120fps mode or resolution and visual quality. These updates have made us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;fall in love with old games&lt;/a&gt; or appreciate how much better they run on modern consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELXvOo"&gt;This emerging trend brings better choice to console gaming and pushes it closer to the wide range of options and modes that have been available on PC for years. During our review of the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, we noted that it felt like this trend was emerging, but I’m still surprised to see these game mode updates appear so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="drZ0YB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PS5 and Xbox Series X made us fall back in love with old games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"PS5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ArBMUn"&gt;So why do these game modes matter? Moving from 30fps to 60fps is obviously a big deal that has been happening in console gaming for years now. It results in much smoother gameplay across a variety of titles, and it’s particularly noticeable in racing games or first-person shooters. Put simply, it makes games feel a lot different and can reduce input lag and improve how you end up playing a title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJaBvX"&gt;Being able to choose between all of the graphic options turned on or some visual settings disabled with better performance means you can play a game the way you want. If you want a more cinematic experience, turn on the resolution mode. If you want the buttery-smooth feel, turn on the frame rate mode. Some game developers have also introduced balanced modes, but the choices are always relatively simple compared to the myriad options in PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTu6z"&gt;While most games are trying to target 60fps these days, the promise of ray tracing means the option to play how you want is increasingly important. Ray tracing delivers more realistic scenes in games, with real-time lighting and effects. It’s an addition to this generation that hasn’t been fully explored by developers yet, but it comes at a performance cost that means recent games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; are having to run at 30fps. This is where performance modes and options can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dRQGTz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdbtOKQ1iLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8DtsN"&gt;Insomniac Games has been quick to add new modes to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man Remastered&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5 to even let you enable ray tracing with a 60fps performance mode. While the game takes a resolution hit in scenes as a result, it’s far less noticeable than if you were running at 30fps instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xud3ED"&gt;Other console game updates are also targeting new 120fps modes. The jump from 60fps to 120fps might feel less significant for some, but I’d argue it’s equally important. It’s the type of change you’ll notice gradually, and if you switch back from 120fps to 60fps you’ll immediately feel the difference. It does require a compatible TV or monitor, though, so a lot of people are missing out right now. A surprising amount of games are offering 120fps support already, including big names like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgBY78"&gt;Hitting 120fps reliably means a sacrifice in resolution, so most games will not offer full 4K at 120fps on these consoles. If you have the right TV or monitor, the benefits of a 120fps mode are obvious for certain games. First-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; feel more responsive, and input latency is reduced for racing games like &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt;. If your TV supports variable refresh rate (VRR), then the benefits are even clearer as you get smooth gameplay without screen tearing when the frame rate dips at these higher refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3cwjotOasX_lWgpzzpk6zewAFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21959023/dirt5modes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dirt 5&lt;em&gt;’s game modes.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vLOhxM"&gt;These new 120fps modes aren’t appearing equally, though. While the Xbox Series X offers more than 20 games with 120fps options, the PS5 has less than 10. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; all offer 120fps options on the Xbox side, but the PS5 support is lagging behind. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; developer Psyonix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579166/ps5-120fps-games-support-developer-rocket-league"&gt;revealed last year&lt;/a&gt; that enabling 120fps in Xbox games is a minor patch, but it requires a “full native port” for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ctpaf"&gt;This gap is largely on existing popular cross-platform games, and it’s bound to be one we’ll see close as developers have more time to port games and work on modes. Sony is also planning to support VRR on the PS5 with a future update, and once that arrives it should spur developers on to support 120fps more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyRMTM"&gt;It’s been encouraging to witness the speed of game updates for these new consoles, though. We might still be waiting on next-gen games and actual stock of consoles, but once you’re able to purchase a new Xbox or PS5, the games you’re already playing will probably offer lots of these new modes.&lt;/p&gt;
