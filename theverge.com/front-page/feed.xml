    <title>This smart collar wants to be an Apple Watch for your dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A cute brown dog wearing an Invoxia Smart Dog Collar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOa6A3Fw0pFhMxwHi-8HF9XTNpQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344311/Smart_Dog_Collar_Logo___Invoxia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invoxia’s Smart Dog Collar uses miniaturized radars to monitor resting respiratory and heart rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Invoxia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iU8QjI"&gt;Pet trackers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20680991/fi-smart-collar-pet-dog-fitness-tracker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;been around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/4/14149086/whistle-3-gps-pet-tracker-price-date-ces-2017"&gt;for ages&lt;/a&gt;, but Invoxia is looking to shake things up at CES 2022 with a new smart collar that can also monitor your dog’s vital signs. And of course, the smart collar also doubles as a GPS and activity tracker for your pooch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KRraN"&gt;Canine fitness trackers generally rely on a combination of accelerometers and GPS sensors. Invoxia’s approach is a bit different. To monitor vitals like resting respiratory and heart rate, Invoxia says it worked with board-certified veterinary cardiologists to develop deep learning AI that utilizes miniaturized radar sensors — the same type as the Soli radar Google used in its Pixel 4 phones. According to Invoxia CEO Amélie Caudron, the radars are ideal as they’re capable of taking readings regardless of how furry your dog is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XyCFV"&gt;“There’s a radar that faces the neck and sends a radio signal, and that signal will not be reflected by the hair,” Caudron told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So it doesn’t matter how much fur or hair there is, it’ll be reflected by the first layer of skin. So the radar will actually be able to know the speed and movement of the skin right under the collar.” Those movements are then fed into an algorithm that determines heart and respiratory rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz96Om"&gt;Another plus, Caudron says, is that the collar can sit more loosely and comfortably around the dog’s neck. That’s not the case with the smartwatches and fitness trackers humans use, which require a tighter fit and good skin contact to get accurate heart rate readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCXPiO"&gt;Invoxia isn’t the only pet tech out there that tracks dog vital signs. Believe it or not, there are also &lt;a href="https://vetmeasure.com/continuous-heart-rate-monitor/"&gt;continuous heart rate monitoring EKG vests&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://petpace.com/"&gt;Petpace Smart Collar&lt;/a&gt;. However, those are more for veterinarians than regular pet owners and don’t include GPS tracking. (EKG vests may also require you to rub a conductive gel onto your dog, so good luck if you have a fidgety Fido on your hands.) The Invoxia collar stands out by combining a traditional GPS tracker with a noninvasive way to monitor vitals. It’s compatible with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and LTE-M, and features escape alerts and a built-in buzzer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of the Invoxia app next to a blue smart collar" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0PNu0lqB8_bVxm-m3WH_TqBfnA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131106/App___Smart_Dog_Collar.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Invoxia&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VkM9Ci"&gt;As for activity tracking, Invoxia says it already has four years of data collected from its original &lt;a href="https://www.invoxia.com/nl/pet-tracker"&gt;GPS Pet Tracker&lt;/a&gt;. On top of monitoring vitals, the collar can also track daily activity and identify when your dog is walking, running, scratching, eating or drinking, barking, and resting. It also has a removable fabric covering for easier cleaning if your dog happens to like running around in the mud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs7nt1"&gt;That said, the Invoxia collar will mostly focus on your individual dog’s baseline. Thus far, continuous vital monitoring on dogs hasn’t really been possible at a large enough scale to customize based on breed — even though some breeds may be more predisposed to heart or respiratory conditions. However, Caudron isn’t ruling out that may be a possibility with more data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emxxwX"&gt;As for why you might even want to know your dog’s vital signs, Invoxia says it could be useful for pets post-surgery, monitoring how pets might respond to medication, or for keeping an eye on those with known cardiac and respiratory illnesses. She also noted that often, owners notice something is wrong with their pets too late. Detecting anomalies in a pet’s baseline may help owners and vets catch illnesses early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbkgaY"&gt;There is a catch, however. For now, the Invoxia collar is only for medium to large-sized dogs. That’s because it’s hard to miniaturize the radar tech to a size that would be comfortable and lightweight enough for smaller pets, like toy dogs and cats. (And if you’ve ever put &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-put-a-fitness-tracker-on-my-lazy-dog-it-did-not-go-a-1844364696"&gt;a large tracker on a small dog&lt;/a&gt;, size and comfort make a huge difference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rWqL6"&gt;Invoxia says the collar is expected to be available in summer 2022. It’ll cost an estimated $99 for the collar itself and an additional $12.99 monthly subscription for GPS features. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hands off: Moen’s new smart faucet doesn’t even need a handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ld0ezaW_0LwtytQGhgwU3Txr-Rg=/0x768:2100x2168/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343552/Moen_Smart_Faucet_with_Motion_Control___No_Handle___Brushed_Gold.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moen’s newest smart faucet goes handle-free.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Moen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5USWw"&gt;Moen revealed its latest smart faucet at CES this week: the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion Control. The new feature adds completely handle-free operation, using gestures to control temperature as well as flow. But you can still have a handle if you really want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOMoQ7"&gt;The idea is you operate the faucet using swipe and push motions in front of the sensor to get hot, warm, or cold water. The Moen Smart Water App should let you set the default temperatures, as well as customize the gestures further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnXrZWLpeqflNa3t2uKrjF6sVeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133025/Moen_Smart_Faucet_with_Motion_Control___Nio___No_Handle___Chrome.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The handle-free design of the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion is a minimalist’s dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4iNciQ"&gt;The new faucet has all the features of the existing Moen Smart Faucet — including voice activation (with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant). There’s also the ability to dispense precise measurements and temperatures — so you can ask for one cup of 100-degree water, as well as set presets for common commands (such as the right temperature and volume to fill your coffee pot versus your water bottle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fXV3"&gt;There are two handle-free styles at launch and four options that feature the more traditional control option as well. Pricing starts at $675 and varies based on style and finish, and it will be available to buy in April 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WONUfV"&gt;Moen also announced integrations between its smart faucet and other smart water products and its new Smart Water Network, a residential smart water ecosystem centered around Moen’s Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1rBZVr8cUFhBoZXuDnAa8VJ-K0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132981/Moen_Smart_Water_Network___Products.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moen’s smart devices will all work together as part of its Smart Water Network. From left: Moen Smart Faucet, Smart Leak Detector, Smart Sump Pump Monitor, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff, Smart Shower controller. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SBiBoU"&gt;If a house has the smart water monitor and a Moen faucet and / or smart shower installed, the devices should soon be able to communicate with each other to help winterize the system and prevent burst pipes by flushing the water lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50ZdWR"&gt;The Smart Water Monitor installs on a home’s main water supply line and monitors the water flow, pressure, and temperature to notify you of leaks, burst pipes, and other potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Aedjc"&gt;When paired with the other Moen products and controlled by the Moen Smart Water app, a homeowner is supposed to be able to tell the system to winterize itself by shutting off water coming into the home and purging the water line via the faucet and shower. When it’s time to get the pipes flowing again, a Health Protect feature should flush the water lines to prevent dirt, debris, or germs from building up in the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEp6cj"&gt;The system also has a built-in freeze protection feature. When it senses high pressure or low temperatures that could cause a pipe to burst, it can automatically shut off water to the home via the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff, then purge the water line using the Moen faucet and shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKpC8c"&gt;The Moen Smart Water App integration with the smart faucet will launch in 2022, with the smart shower coming to the app in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cEg7s"&gt;This type of integration currently requires a substantial investment in products from one company, but the whole home approach to protecting and monitoring essential infrastructure in a house is a key part of the possible future of the smart home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netgear is turning its connected picture frame into a display for NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbLeURqJmRdP8_cUZ9buHOGRGS4=/0x2:396x266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344209/Screenshot_2021_12_20_143606.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tNsyW5"&gt;Whether you wanted it or not, NFTs are finding ways of creeping into just about every aspect of our lives. Something that began as a curiosity has quickly expanded to include networking giant Netgear and its connected smart frame, Meural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXi7qZ"&gt;Regardless of how you feel about NFTs, companies like Netgear are capitalizing on this interest by integrating them into products like the existing Meural Frame. With a way to put these works of “art” on display, it allows these commodities to also become decorations for something besides Twitter profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ocT4xF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"},{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6tlt7T"&gt;While the Meural began its life as a way to display photos, Netgear recently announced that it would begin beta testing integration between the Meural and the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet starting in January. This partnership is what allows you to upload NFTs to Meural and safely store them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Qcv4"&gt;Pretend for a second that you don’t know what an NFT is and you don’t want to. The Meural can still display slideshows and images from your phone locally or remotely. It’s also slated to have access to the world's largest streaming library of art and photography. This library is set to include works from classical and contemporary artists as well as a variety of branded content. This service is available as either a monthly or annual subscription and costs $8.95 and $69.95 respectively. Thankfully, you can also share pictures to the Meural through the dedicated app or through a built-in MicroSD card slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW3Qwe"&gt;The Meural Frames are available in a variety of sizes, from a desk-sized 13.5 x 7.5 inches and reaching up to larger wall-mounted options that measure 16 x 24 and 19 x 29 inches. However, none of the frames have a display resolution greater than 1080p, which is a little disappointing in a world where displays like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18147273/samsung-the-frame-serif-4k-hdr-tv-announced-ces-2019-features"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame exists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4pwWW"&gt;The smaller photo frame retails for $299.95, and the larger two cost $399.95 and $599.95. All of these models are available in a variety of colorways with varying availability on Amazon or Netgear.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netgear thinks you’ll pay extra for ad blocking on its Orbi routers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6hC3LB_5OlI8Mdp6IDJkpuAIpI=/68x0:1334x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344210/NETGEAR_Game_Booster_Image_1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Booster service will cost $50 annually&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAbTdE"&gt;The demands placed on our home networks are higher than ever, especially when it comes to gaming. Netgear was arguably one of the first router manufacturers to optimize the networking needed for gaming with its Nighthawk line of routers. Now, it's attempting the same thing with its new line of 6E enabled Orbi mesh routers. The Game Booster service largely resembles the Nighthawk Pro Gaming application used to configure their XR line of gaming routers, with one glaring difference: it requires a subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwENb4"&gt;The Game Booster service for Orbi devices will cost $50 annually, and while this isn’t a massive sum of money, it certainly raises some questions about why Netgear is charging for a service that was previously offered for free on other devices. This decision is made all the more puzzling when you consider how expensive an Orbi system is, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716979/netgear-orbi-quad-band-wi-fi-6e-mesh-router-release-date-specs-price"&gt;some larger systems costing as much as $1,500&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9Q8C5"&gt;Netgear states that Game Booster offers more than a simple quality of service (QoS) optimizer. Besides making QoS easier to use, the Game Booster software, much like the Nighthawk Pro Gaming application, provides you with easy-to-read metrics to help you fine-tune your home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="454uW8"&gt;Game Booster should allow you to prioritize server connectivity based on ping or location, and allow you to allocate and reserve bandwidth for both downloads and uploads on a per-device basis. However, Netgear has stated that this service is not a VPN or meant to replace your VPN. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lal5powi9apYq56ZYo4mBZFiVog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132479/netgear.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The app includes ping heat maps and device throttling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5B4qvM"&gt;While many of these features are also present in other services, Game Booster will also include an integrated ad-blocker with a regularly updated block list. The blocker will also allow you to fine-tune which devices and domains are blocked, in addition to providing you with updated metrics on its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MEsnIJeHGlwmV4JwfU0mEYGGhOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132512/netgear2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated ad blockers are one of the new features offered by the Game Booster app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MVmtj5"&gt;Having more granular control over your home network is certainly a good thing, however many of the features offered by this paid service ultimately rely on the assumption of an ideal network environment among other factors. They’re also largely tools that other routers provide for free, or, as in the case of the ad blocker, can be built for a &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-pi-hole-raspberry-pi"&gt;fairly low upfront cost by a savvy user&lt;/a&gt;. This all raises some questions as to whether this paid service will be beneficial enough to merit the subscription in addition to the above-average cost of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsVWBP"&gt;The Game Booster application is set to be available for 750 and 850 series Orbi devices beginning in Q1 2022.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 10 Pro official teaser shows off triple rear cameras and Hasselblad branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKEVQOezKkllKkl0c_JyWzXTT7k=/0x0:6750x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344224/OnePlus_10_Pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFgjMU"&gt;The rear camera layout of OnePlus’s next flagship, the OnePlus 10 Pro, has been shown off in a teaser image for the smartphone. The handset is due to launch in China on January 11th before coming to the rest of the world later in the year. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau previously confirmed that the phone would be revealed in January in a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1110411735/L72FWaAtT#comment"&gt;post on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g94BHg"&gt;Although the teaser image doesn’t show much more than the rear of the phone, it confirms the 10 Pro will have three rear cameras that will once again carry the Hasselblad branding. OnePlus’s partnership with the Swedish camera manufacturer began with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, where the two companies worked together on the color tuning of the phone’s photos, with generally good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkcZzl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A three-stage ringer switch is also visible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SCKlcq"&gt;The image also confirms the phone’s camera bump design, which has previously appeared in leaks from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-10-pro-specifications-exclusive/"&gt;Twitter tipster @OnLeaks and &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although the specs of these cameras are yet to be officially revealed, reports indicate the OnePlus 10 Pro will feature a 48-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, an 8-megapixel telephoto, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAWlKB"&gt;Internally, it’ll reportedly be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. There’s also an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. In the official image released today, we can also see the trademark OnePlus three-stage ringer switch, which in the past has let you easily switch the phone into its vibration and silent modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AedmH"&gt;OnePlus hasn’t announced when the OnePlus 10 series might launch outside of China, but &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles &lt;/em&gt;previously reported that a global release could come by April.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gS63RC"&gt;Withings isn’t a stranger to smart scales, but for CES 2022 the company is taking a much more ambitious take on the gadget. Announced today, the Withings Body Scan will feature six-lead EKG readings, segmented body composition measurements, and the ability to assess foot nerve activity. Basically, it’s the scale for people who want to know how fat is distributed through their body and how that might in turn relate to their heart health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHfFGU"&gt;On the surface, the Body Scan looks like your typical scale — albeit with a retractable handle up top. It contains four weight sensors and 14 ITO electrodes in the scale itself, plus an additional four located in the handle. The scale also features a larger 3.2-inch LCD color screen, as well as a battery life of one year. It’ll also integrate with Withings’ smartwatches, on top of Apple HealthKit and Google Fit APIs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuKwjE"&gt;While the handle is definitely unique visually, it’s also what enables the Body Scan’s more interesting features. Smart scales measure body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). It works by sending a low-level electrical current through your body. Body fat, water, and lean mass all have different resistance levels, so depending on the rate at which the current travels, the scale will estimate your body composition. However, most scales only have two points of contact: your feet. That means you’re really getting an estimate for &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/body-fat-scales/body-fat-scale-review/"&gt;your lower body only&lt;/a&gt;. Withings says the Body Scan will use “multi-frequency” BIA as the retractable handle provides two extra points of contact, hence, segmented body composition measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzWHZ5"&gt;Withings claims the Body Scan can differentiate between your torso, your right and left legs, and your right and left arms. The scale will also break down body composition into whole-body fat and water percentages, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass, and extracellular and intracellular water. It’s hard to say how accurate the Body Scan will be — &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/body-fat-scales/body-fat-scale-review/"&gt;smart scales are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/4/e22487"&gt;notoriously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s admittedly nice to see that Withings is attempting to provide extra context. For example, many smart scales don’t differentiate between subcutaneous and visceral fat. While jiggly subcutaneous fat is relatively harmless, invisible visceral fat &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-aim-at-belly-fat"&gt;is the kind that’s actually most dangerous to your health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4FI1j"&gt;Body composition has had a recent resurgence in wearables. Samsung introduced BIA analysis on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, while Amazon also introduced a body fat feature on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its Halo platform&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these companies has emphasized their body fat tools as an alternative to Body Mass Index (BMI), which is &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;a flawed metric for evaluating your overall health&lt;/a&gt;. That said, improperly tracking body fat can also act as &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/trackandfield/2021/10/women-athletes-allege-body-shaming-within-oregon-ducks-track-and-field-program.html"&gt;a potential trigger for body dysmorphia&lt;/a&gt; and other eating disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JovdxZQKcveB-nSkeF2WDtHQnrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128369/2021_11_15_WBS08_CES_PERS34.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Withings&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Body Scan will retail for $279 and come in black and white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ooJxWF"&gt;“We’ve been looking for a way to do this safely and effectively,” Withings chief medical officer Shikha Anand told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We can’t solve the way in which the world sees weight, but that said, we will make every effort not to exacerbate it. We will ground in health and not in weight wherever we can. It will always be about how your weight relates to your health.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmPWpM"&gt;Anand went on to explain that weight is often tied to self-esteem, and that’s part of why Withings wants to repackage its scale as a health station. The idea, Anand says, is to show how your weight relates in context to your overall cardiovascular health, as well as offer more holistic, behavioral insights. Anand also emphasized Withings is testing the Body Scan with a diverse cohort of consumers to ensure the body composition feature is more helpful than harmful. She also said the Withings app would be upgraded with better data visualizations for long-term trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTEw2c"&gt;Aside from body composition, Withings says the Body Scan will provide heart rate, EKG recordings, and vascular age data at each weigh-in. EKG readings can be saved and shared with doctors. Meanwhile, the vascular age feature is meant to show people how their cardiovascular health compares to other people within their age group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XVfxx"&gt;While body composition, and even EKGs, make sense for a scale, Withings is taking it one step further with a new nerve assessment feature developed with French medical device maker Impeto Medical. The scale will purportedly measure sweat gland activity in your feet and generate a score. According to Withings, foot nerve activity is currently under investigational use and could potentially show signs of nerve dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHIrFB"&gt;This is all well and good, but like Withings’ other recent gadgets, the Body Scan is subject to FDA and CE clearance. So while Withings says it plans to launch the Body Scan for $279 in the second half of 2022, that’ll all depend on how fast the company can get the regulatory go-ahead. The Withing ScanWatch, for instance, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;introduced at CES 2020&lt;/a&gt; and only obtained FDA clearance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;in November 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Anand says Withings is optimistic it won’t take quite as long this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPxisO"&gt;“We’ve learned a lot with the process of the ScanWatch, and gotten to know the team at the FDA quite a bit better. I feel we’re on the path to have [the Body Scan] on a reasonable time frame.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9ZJj6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $949.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, although in the past few months we’ve seen it discounted down to $799.99. The best deal at the moment, however, is only available at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base model for $949.99&lt;/a&gt;. The 512GB model is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards, save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; last year, come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id2Hln"&gt;There are multiple variants of both models, however, we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of Amazon’s $78 discount last month on the 14-inch base model. There are no deals available at the moment, either, though Best Buy will throw in some incentives when you buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggHmcuFlcg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglodJJhkbP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16-inch model&lt;/a&gt;, including six months of Apple Music, 15 months of Microsoft 365 for the price of 12, free security software, and a handful of other special offers. You can also get a discount when you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"},{"title":"12 great apps ready for your new Mac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22814365/mac-best-apps-apple-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases, and starts at $1,299. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. In mid-December, we saw the base model drop down to $1099.99, but right now, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo are only selling it for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. That may not be as steep of a discount, but that’s still a savings of $100. The larger, 512GB configuration with 8GB of RAM is also currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604810-REG%2Fapple_myd92ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo in space gray for $1,349.00&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. If you’re looking for a discount, both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling the base model&lt;/a&gt; with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $649 ($50 off), as well as the 512GB variant for $829 instead of $899 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-512GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2FDFF%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sengled’s newest smart bulb can track your heart rate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rD8UeCIfpXbAiF3DZCT4nffIQqU=/0x0:2756x1837/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344165/HEALTH_MONITORING_LIGHT.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sengled’s smart bulb can track your sleep and your heart rate.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sengled&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oAtGFO"&gt;Sengled, the smart lighting company that’s hedged its protocol bets by making Zigbee, Wi-Fi, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bluetooth smart bulbs, has announced a slew of new products at CES 2022. The most intriguing is the Smart Health Monitoring bulb, and the most fun is the Wi-Fi Video-Sync TV light strips. Sengled has also pledged its support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, the new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, adding a fourth protocol to its package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLiGo1"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the smart lighting company, Sengled offers a variety of connected bulbs covering most smart home bases. Its Zigbee smart bulbs work with a hub, similar to Philips Hue, and are compatible with Alexa, Google, Apple HomeKit, and Samsung SmartThings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJtVnG"&gt;Its Wi-Fi bulbs don’t require a hub and work with Alexa, Google, and Samsung SmartThings platforms. Its Bluetooth bulbs currently work with Alexa only, but Sengled’s Kenneth Camp, Product Innovation Director, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a briefing ahead of CES that Google Home support is arriving this March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9rqWF"&gt;The company’s bulbs stand out for their high Color Rendering Index, which are mostly over 90 CRI, higher than a lot of the competition. CRI is a measure of how well a light bulb reproduces color, with a CRI of 100 showing true color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdvCsR"&gt;The Sengled Smart Health Monitoring Light is a dual Wi-Fi / Bluetooth bulb with built-in health monitoring using radar technology. It’s designed to track your sleep and certain biometric measurements, such as heart rate and body temperature, as well as other vital signs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h6Cj2"&gt;The bulb can work alone, or multiple bulbs connected via a Bluetooth mesh network work together to create a virtual map that can help detect human behavior. Camp said it could even determine if someone has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9tPid"&gt;This could be an impressively unobtrusive way to help monitor whether a person living alone has fallen and potentially injured themselves. Although what it will do about it once it detects a fall has yet to be revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkiWDX"&gt;The product is still under development, so details such as pricing are scarce, but Camp said it’s due to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sengled’s new Wi-Fi LED TV Light Strips with Video sync fit screen sizes 55 to 65 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f59p8c"&gt;The new Wi-Fi TV Light Strips with Video-Sync (which should cost $120 and are coming in Q2) is another option for the trend of lighting up your TV for that truly immersive experience. Sengled’s version uses a small camera to detect what content is playing on your TV, meaning it’s not reliant on an HDMI input. This is similar to how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;Govee Immersion TV Backlights&lt;/a&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j81Z3X"&gt;Sengled’s Video-Sync light strips will work with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings, and can be paired with existing Sengled entertainment products, such as &lt;a href="https://us.sengled.com/collections/new-light-strips/products/sengled-smart-wi-fi-led-light-strip"&gt;Audio-Sync TV Light Strips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;a href="https://us.sengled.com/products/sengled-smart-wi-fi-led-light-bars?_pos=2&amp;amp;_sid=751046b10&amp;amp;_ss=r"&gt;LED Light Bars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijEMOJ"&gt;Camp also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Sengled will launch its first Matter-compatible bulb this year. “We are heavily involved in Matter,” he says. “As soon as it launches, we’ll have our first Wi-Fi A19 bulb ready to go.” He also said the company is looking at adding Thread bulbs to its lineup later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cd6lA7"&gt;Other new products Sengled announced at CES 2022 include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7mV5ua"&gt;Wi-Fi Outdoor String Lights feature 48 feet or 96 feet of individually color-addressable light bulbs for lighting up a patio or other outdoor space. They will cost somewhere between $80 to $90 per strip and will be available in Q2. The string lights are dual-chip Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, allowing you to control them with either protocol — so you can use your phone if your home’s Wi-Fi doesn’t reach to your patio. An integrated microphone will allow for music syncing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7UhtDa"&gt;A full-color, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connected Portable LED Lamp powered by a rechargeable battery with a dimming function also arrives in Q2. The lamp has music sync and can be powered by a plug or run on battery for up to eight hours. It also includes effects such as “flickering candle” and a wake-up routine, it will cost $60 to $70.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Ggl1S"&gt;A Wi-Fi LED Essential Oil Diffuser Light is slated for Q1 with no pricing yet. The lamp will have scheduling and timer features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BvC2NH"&gt;A Zigbee window and door sensor, and a motion sensor for controlling smart lights will arrive in Q2. No pricing is available yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D61GoN"&gt;Bluetooth Mesh LED recessed ceiling lights in white and color options with a standard Edison E26 base also arrive in 2022, but no pricing has been released.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes found guilty of defrauding investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jury Deliberates In Theranos Fraud Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLnO2oobIopQ90B25zX-lMQi7c0=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344122/1237402952.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Odisho/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NGutlT"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes deliberately misled investors about the capabilities of the blood testing technology at Theranos and is guilty of three counts of wire fraud, a jury found today. She is also guilty of conspiracy to defraud investors with her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVf26I"&gt;She faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the counts. The jury found her not guilty of two counts of defrauding patients and not guilty of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury did not return a verdict on three more counts of defrauding investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8Hd5v"&gt;Holmes was the founder and CEO of Theranos, a company that promised to revolutionize blood testing by developing a device that could run hundreds of medical tests on just a few drops of blood. The company was an immediate sensation in Silicon Valley and, at one point, was valued at more than $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXHV5F"&gt;But in 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline"&gt;an exposé&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; revealed major problems with Theranos’ tech, and federal investigations found problems that &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/futureofyou/104100/government-says-theranos-lab-problems-pose-immediate-jeopardy-to-patients"&gt;jeopardized patient safety&lt;/a&gt; at its labs. The company closed its labs in 2016, and in 2018, Holmes and her former partner, Theranos president Balwani, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/us-v-elizabeth-holmes-et-al"&gt;were charged&lt;/a&gt; with wire fraud and conspiracy in federal court. The US government is alleging that Holmes and Balwani deliberately misled investors and the public about the reliability of Theranos’ blood testing technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWLlgA"&gt;The Holmes trial, delayed for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/elizabeth-holmes-trial-pushed-to-august-after-surprise-pregnancy-announcement.html"&gt;Holmes’ pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, started in September and stretched out for three months. Day to day, testimony was slowed &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/hMg63byi6QSIyz6Gi6ng"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/ZdrYm9usEECxM5IQewaq"&gt;jurors&lt;/a&gt; being dismissed, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/elizabeth-holmes-trial-delayed-after-juror-potentially-exposed-to-covid.html"&gt;COVID-19 exposures&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/water-outage-delays-elizabeth-holmes-trial-on-fraud-charges/"&gt;burst pipe&lt;/a&gt;, and lectures from the judge about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770951/holmes-trial-jurors-loud-typing-laptops-macbook"&gt;loud typing in the gallery&lt;/a&gt;. Over two dozen witnesses testified, and Holmes spent seven days on the stand in her own defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qwdcz"&gt;Holmes said during her testimony that she didn’t try to mislead investors about what the Theranos blood testing program was capable of. She &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html"&gt;deflected blame&lt;/a&gt; for any errors to others at the company and insinuated that investors just &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2021/11/holmes-accuses-theranos-president-sexual-abuse.html?page=all"&gt;misinterpreted&lt;/a&gt; some of her statements about what Theranos was doing. At the same time, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799756/elizabeth-holmes-pfizer-logo-confession"&gt;admitted to adding logos from pharmaceutical companies&lt;/a&gt; to Theranos-produced lab reports without those companies’ authorization or knowledge, and the jury heard recordings and saw videos of her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22820995/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-testimony-defense-abuse"&gt;lying&lt;/a&gt; about what types of blood tests the company could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t72j63"&gt;To find her guilty of fraud, the jury had to be unanimously convinced that Holmes knew that the information she gave to investors or to patients was misleading and that she gave that information intentionally in order to convince them to give money to Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTSVMh"&gt;Balwani now faces his own fraud trial for the same charges, which is set to begin in February.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The solar roof could finally become a reality thanks to GAF Energy’s nailable solar shingles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxQ1krh-938K9k8ns6ih3PR3AY0=/0x6:1152x774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343840/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210310_1904_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDyosX"&gt;In 2016, Tesla tried to reinvent the humble roof as a beautiful array of glass tiles brimming with solar energy — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410075/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-customer-reactions"&gt;a vision it’s been struggling to deliver ever since&lt;/a&gt;. But San Jose, California-based GAF Energy thinks it has a simpler solution to the solar roof. It’s built a solar shingle, one that can be nailed down in packs much like the everyday shingles you’d use when repairing or replacing your normal, non-solar roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="axChQT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Solar panel, meet nail gun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DN9RWV"&gt;You might have heard of solar shingles before, but GAF Energy president Martin DeBono suggests the new Timberline Solar shingles are the first to actually deserve that name because they’re the first to actually work that way — you literally drive nails through a three-inch nailing strip, overlap the top of that shingle with the bottom of the next one, and repeat. “A number of companies have come out with what &lt;em&gt;they &lt;/em&gt;call solar shingles, but they’re pretty much identical to regular solar panels, just small,” explains DeBono, saying how those previous solar roofs also required rails so the panels could be screwed down. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ldr5q46fMOrC2W1Kz6sOY-K33ic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142983/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210308_0663_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FeqReN"&gt;The result of true shingles, DeBono claims, is that it takes days instead of weeks to install a solar roof. “We’ve installed them already in two days, including ripping off the old roof and putting on the new roof,” he says. The company already tried traditional tile-based solar roofs, &lt;a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/gaf-energy-has-installed-more-solar-roofs-than-tesla"&gt;pointing me to a previous interview&lt;/a&gt; where DeBono said GAF Energy had installed over 2,000 of them, allegedly more than Tesla. “It takes multiple days, 10 to 12 people on the roof,” DeBono relates. But its parent company, building materials conglomerate Standard Industries, decided to invest over $1 billion in this seemingly simpler shingle solution instead. (&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/19/meet-the-billionaire-family-building-americas-roofs-and-taking-on-elon-musk/?sh=433763226eac"&gt;Here’s a&lt;em&gt; Forbes&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt; of Standard Industries’ founders and their solar play.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Lufu"&gt;DeBono says the Timberline Solar are the first products to ever receive UL’s 7103 certification to serve as both solar panels &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; construction materials, thanks to a special sandwich of glass, polysilicon solar cells, and top layer of a proprietary fluorinated alkane ethylene polymer that’s fire-resistant, impact-resistant, textured to be walkable, and still transparent enough to let the light through. He says they give the panels a Class A fire rating, stand up to hail, and yet the shingles are actually less dense at the same thickness as a normal shingle, meaning they weigh slightly less and should be just as easy for roofers to sling around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65_DJ3P1QNCZvoJfW8S1o0SfW6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143071/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210310_1925_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kPVXeE"&gt;And while it takes a lot more solar shingles than solar panels to form a roof — an average-sized 6kW array might take up 130 of them — DeBono says it shouldn’t be less efficient or more costly just because there are more modules. For one thing, DeBono says the Thai cells his company is using are 22.6 percent efficient, within a few percent of the state-of-the-art in solar panels, and the greater number of shingles means the system’s total power doesn’t degrade as much when some of them get shaded as the sun moves and the weather turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eUqKU"&gt;For another, that 6kW system should take up between 350 and 450 square feet on a roof, roughly the same amount of space as a rack-mounted solar panel system, and the rest of the roof can be filled in with matched shingles from GAF. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avtxYi86x6fRAjC7XXcUyzWPdhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143032/Timberline_Solar_PK100_THP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KMSubY"&gt;But, like other solar roofs, it’ll definitely cost more than simply adding solar panels to an existing known-good roof. “It will cost the same as if you were to get a new roof and put solar on it,” says DeBono. (He declined to say how much each individual shingle costs.) But because a lot more people are getting new roofs each year than are adding solar — 5 million a year vs. 300,000 a year, he suggests — there’s a big opportunity for some of those people to add integrated renewable energy while they’re at it. Particularly since GAF already sells traditional shingles to cover one out of every four of those roofs, the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oiuhv1"&gt;The solar shingles don’t look &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like shingles, of course — there are covers for their wiring (for easier maintenance than having to remove the entire tile, says DeBono), and you’ll need a mid-circuit interrupt safety device for every 2kW of panel that fits in a visible box (though DeBono says you could put those in the attic instead of atop the roof). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Pkl3"&gt;GAF Energy is currently making all of these in a 130,000 square foot facility in San Jose, California, with a capacity of roughly 50 megawatts per year. That isn’t as tremendous an amount as it might sound — it’s a little over 8,300 homes per year if you assume each of them requires the average 6kW array. But DeBono says he’s also looking at it as just GAF Energy’s first manufacturing facility, with more potentially on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msSYnX"&gt;He says the new Timberline Solar panels are available now via sister company &lt;a href="https://www.gaf.com/en-us/roofing-contractors"&gt;GAF’s existing network of roofing contractors&lt;/a&gt; across the US East Coast and Texas — though these panels specifically aren’t available in big solar states California or Florida quite yet. He says it’ll take roughly 90 days for them to be listed with the California Energy Commission and possibly four to five months for additional wind testing in Florida. The company will expand to other states from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPk6t8"&gt;GAF Energy actually &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/11/gaf-energy-moves-its-solar-manufacturing-from-asia-to-the-us/"&gt;moved its solar manufacturing from Asia to California just this past year&lt;/a&gt;, and the timing isn’t all great: the solar industry is currently fighting against a new California proposal to charge solar panel owners a flat fee for every kW of solar panel capacity they hook up to the grid, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-12-16/california-plan-to-cut-solar-incentives-boiling-point"&gt;in addition to other reduced incentives for installing solar&lt;/a&gt;. “What has been proposed would be the death of the solar industry in California, and that’s not hyperbole,” DeBono tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/03/11/470097580/nevada-solar-power-business-struggles-to-keep-the-lights-on"&gt;what happened to the Nevada solar industry&lt;/a&gt; after that state phased out incentives and how the state &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/07/531952407/solar-firms-plan-to-return-to-nevada-after-new-law-restores-incentives"&gt;eventually changed its tune.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
