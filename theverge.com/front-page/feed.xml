    <title>Tencent-branded RedMagic gaming phone launched with 165Hz screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-SCNrcWjZGJVFlJcmOJZY1R2ts=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915577/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jt4Wf9"&gt;RedMagic, the gaming brand of ZTE subdivision Nubia, has launched a new smartphone in collaboration with Chinese tech and gaming giant Tencent. The RedMagic 6 and 6 Pro are high-end devices available to order now in China, with a global launch coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQdVcr"&gt;The RedMagic 6 has an Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, active fan cooling, and a 6.8-inch 1080p OLED display with a refresh rate of 165Hz, making it the fastest phone screen on the market today. RedMagic is also claiming a single-finger touch sampling rate of up to 500Hz, or up to 360Hz with multitouch. The touch-sensitive capacitive “shoulder triggers” on the side, meanwhile, are sampled at up to 400Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jJmx"&gt;The RedMagic 6 Pro is mostly identical, but it comes with up to 18GB of RAM and has a faster 120W charging system that RedMagic says can fully charge the 4,500mAh battery in just 17 minutes. The non-Pro 6 has a bigger 5,050mAh battery but a slower 66W system that takes 38 minutes for a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HN1LvaJwULNtfRUY6d00qgw3GI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347425/4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QKP5kY"&gt;The Tencent collaboration is quite unusual. RedMagic says that the phone’s software is optimized for Tencent apps like WeChat and QQ, with 50 percent faster read and write speeds. Tencent’s Solar Core gaming software is also preloaded, and the company promises it improves game response speed, frame rates, and network latency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no35i3"&gt;The RedMagic 6 starts at 3,799 yuan (~$585) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can pay almost twice as much for a fully loaded 18GB/512GB RedMagic 6 Pro — that’ll cost 6,599 yuan (~$1,020). Global pricing will likely be different, however; RedMagic will announce international release plans on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Anzu smart glasses break from the pack with truly wireless audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYzhZA4mvfQHcogxYYUlhmXJ8jg=/0x0:980x653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914876/0633B061_F5EE_4959_96DD_F2703EE12435.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9xq6V"&gt;Razer is tonight formally announcing its Anzu “smart” glasses, which follow Bose, Amazon, and other companies by integrating audio speakers directly into the glasses temples. The $199.99 Anzu glasses will be available in both rectangular and round frames, and each will come in two sizes: small and large. You can place an order beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dycIDB"&gt;Two sets of lenses come in the retail package: a regular, clear pair that offers 35 percent blocking against blue light, and Razer also throws in sunglass lenses with 99 percent UV protection. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhkyaNLbicec5ulJyrteZpH9ZIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346669/31CDF711_071A_46F5_B442_29A763A11426.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wXFQHa"&gt;But Razer has deviated from competitors with its approach to audio glasses: the company has used a true wireless design that completely splits the left and right speakers. Razer says this allows for improved comfort since the frames allow for more give and flexibility. On the other hand, it could lead to some strange charging situations: you have to charge &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; temples at the same time — there are pogo pins on each one — and could theoretically encounter the occasional true wireless frustrations like audio dropouts on one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8uPHp"&gt;If you need prescription lenses, Razer has partnered with Lensabl for a 15 percent discount that’s available to Anzu buyers. That’ll obviously end up well above the standard cost, but what are us glasses wearers to do? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IjyMtLATKzm4coPP9P5siIYrb3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346693/00006ED8_8B4F_45BB_B429_325E48ED8FBE.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DAmgC"&gt;Razer has outfitted each side with a 16mm driver, and there are also touch-responsive tap gestures controls on either temple that will let you change tracks, answer calls, or activate a voice assistant. The Anzu glasses are rated IPX4 for water resistance, so you’ll want to avoid serious rain — but they should handle light splashes okay. Razer says it has cut Bluetooth latency down to 60ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjkxS6"&gt;The Anzu glasses automatically power down when folded shut — achieving up to two weeks of standby time — and then pair to the last device once opened back up. Battery life is rated at “up to five hours.” That’s about on par with Bose, which estimates 5.5 hours for its Tenor audio sunglasses. As for sound bleed, which is always a side effect with these audio glasses, Razer told me that people within arm’s distance will probably pick up on your music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHpTX"&gt;The included leatherette case has a magnetic latch and flap for storing the charging cable or extra lenses. The Anzu glasses are exclusively available from &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-wearables%2Frazer-anzu-smart-glasses%2FRZ82-03630800-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; and physical RazerStore locations. In North America, you can get them from Best Buy US and Best Buy Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Find My feature could let you know if you’re the one being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uu22iw8ZbremJQTbBPB24Di5UwQ=/1006x321:2825x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914440/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.42.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KuLOxg"&gt;Apple’s Find My app might get a new safety feature to help prevent someone from using the kinds of devices tracked in the app to stalk you instead. “Item Safety Alerts”, spotted in the iOS 14.5 beta, will notify you if an unknown device being tracked on Find My is “moving with you” so you can remove it or disable it, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-beta-3-changes-features-airtags-find-my-item-safety-alerts-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv8saz"&gt;The feature seems designed to counteract a scenario where a Find My-compatible device is hidden in a pocket or bag and then used to track someone’s movements. The Item Safety Alerts setting was found in early versions of iOS 14.3, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/04/apple-brings-back-airtags-anti-stalking-feature"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed until its reappearance in iOS 14.5. The setting is enabled by default in the beta and Apple seems to want it to stay on. If you turn off the setting off, the system will warn you that unknown devices can see your location without you being notified, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317"&gt;Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo&lt;/a&gt; shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZW2Rg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something I hadn’t considered before: new beta includes a Item Safety setting in Find My. This is how Apple is trying to prevent 'stalking' with AirTags. If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions, your phone will notice and warn you about it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NVJyAZlthw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVJyAZlthw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsUT0a"&gt;Addressing the risk of stalking in Find My is newly important because of Apple’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;open up the app to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook in someone’s bag to track them is difficult, but a small keychain-sized device like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile’s upcoming ultra wideband (UWB) tracker&lt;/a&gt; could be a lot easier. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could also be a candidate for misuse, and reintroducing this feature into iOS might mean they’re on their way to release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tXg8jy9k8c0dG_TGibgzY3HIsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345924/iOS_14.5_Beta_3_AirTags_Item_Safety_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My settings screen with ‘Item Safety Alerts’ turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PyrCdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRnzj"&gt;While it’s not necessarily as powerful as a GPS beacon with a cellular radio, Apple’s Find My network may have more reach than you’d think. If an Apple device comes near one of these supported trackers, it can update its location, even if the tracker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647146/apple-find-my-app-tracker-friends-iphone-wwdc-2019"&gt;doesn’t have its own connection to the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Tile’s “Community Find” feature works similarly. AirTags could theoretically expand the reach and precision even more, with an added UWB signal in the tag that can make items easier to find behind walls and in other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54ZRpg"&gt;There are at least a few examples where gadgets like this have been abused: In 2018, a woman in Texas noticed her ex-partner kept showing up at restaurants, other people’s houses, and even an out-of-town trip, without a clear way of knowing where she was, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/woman-says-ex-used-tile-device-to-stalk-her/3719155/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC 13 &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. She’d later learn her ex had stashed a Tile tracker in the front console of her car, and was using it to find her. A Texas beauty queen shared &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/texas-beauty-queen-claims-stranger-targeted-tracking-device/story?id=38749046"&gt;a similar stalking story in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLyrPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile saw Verizon telling people to turn off 5G and thought ‘why stop there’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UkcxUWzk2ZeM4_98vTRtJWUIEs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914288/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMvZYc"&gt;T-Mobile has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;busy hawking its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spending many additional billions to expand it&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; awkward that it’s also been caught telling users to turn off 5G to save battery life (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1367473288398729223?s=20"&gt;via Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;). Didn’t Verizon just make this same gaff mere days ago? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery"&gt;It sure did&lt;/a&gt;. But instead of learning from the example, T-Mobile appears to have pulled a hold-my-beer: where Verizon told users to switch to LTE, many of T-Mobile’s support documents tell users to go &lt;em&gt;all the way back to 2G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOpONa"&gt;In case you’re not aware, switching to 2G (which T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fnetwork-apn-and-volte-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%23steps3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;handily tells you how to do&lt;/a&gt;) will make your phone next to useless as a data device: the maximum theoretical speed you could get from a 2G connection would be around 1Mbps (though many top out at closer to 256Kbps). Even 1Mbps is 25 times slower than what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;FTC considers to be acceptable broadband speeds&lt;/a&gt;, and 300 times slower than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ffast-mid-band-5g-new-cities-towns-location-coverage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the average 5G mid-band speeds T-Mobile has bragged about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6Y0X"&gt;(Never mind that T-Mobile is also in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;phasing out 2G signals &lt;em&gt;for good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though the 2G shutdown has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;been postponed to 2022&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4W7lI83ZJ7qPmLHKTWF-DwPqF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346365/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_1.44.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;support page for the Samsung Galaxy S21 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2lAUs"&gt;T-Mobile probably realized that this kind of advice was not a great look, but the company’s cover-up has also been amusingly slow. Earlier today, it removed the “Toggle from 5G/LTE to 2G” advice from the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; example &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-like-verizon-also-tells-users-to-turn-off-5g-to-save-on-battery"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;), and the second one (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) had its support page updated shortly before we wrote these words. It also didn’t take long to find the advice to turn off 5G and/or 4G on the pages for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Flg-wing%2Fbattery-life-lg-wing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g%2Fbattery-life-oneplus-nord-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S20+ 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-5g%2Fbattery-life-google-pixel-4a-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; (which weirdly only mentions turning off 4G, not 5G). That’s likely an incomplete list, but you get the picture: the nudge to pick T-Mobile’s slow 2G network showed up a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIVMBH"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9luReeBj72AJ:https://www.t-mobile.com/support/devices/android/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g/battery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Here’s a Google Cache version&lt;/a&gt; of the first T-Mobile support page from March 1st.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKbNQI"&gt;I will say that T-Mobile is right in one way: turning my phone down to 2G would likely make it so slow that I’d just give up trying to use it, and my phone probably would last a lot longer. If you’re struggling with battery life on your phone, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20698309/android-phone-batter-save-drain-how-to"&gt;plenty of things you can try&lt;/a&gt; that don’t involve slamming the brakes quite that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a brilliant gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;The best laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s green screen mouse pad actually seems like a good idea for streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaPg6tU-yMRMGjpzF_7jGmsYA2k=/66x0:5934x3912/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913816/Green_Screen_Mouse_Mat_Lifetsyle_Shot_07.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HdMFu"&gt;Elgato is one of the most notable brands in the consumer tech market when it comes to products aimed toward content creators and streamers. And today, the Corsair-owned company announced that it is expanding its line of creator-focused products. One of the more creative new options is a Green Screen Mouse Mat, which allows streamers and content creators to blend a flat surface like their desk into their video feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwrTeW"&gt;Some streamers, such as competitive gamers and speedrunners, use a hand cam setups to show off their hand movements while on stream. The mouse pad could be a convenient way to let creators put that space to extra use instead of just showing their desk. Streamers doing unboxing videos could replace the mat with an enhanced image of the item they are opening, or gamers could make the game appear around their hands, as a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTlncJ"&gt;The Elgato Green Screen Mouse Mat is available now and costs $30. It’s an extra-large mouse pad, at 37.0 x 15.7 x 0.1 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFKWy2"&gt;Alongside a new green screen mouse pad, Elgato also announced two additional products that started its creator-centric demographic. Those include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;$60 light strip&lt;/a&gt; with 108 dimmable LEDs and $100 Wave Panels, which include six foam pieces that can be mounted to your wall to improve your acoustics. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Realme GT 5G is a very cheap Snapdragon 888-based phone on sale now in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxHTuHJAEvEw79NkFERRMdluTEA=/0x1:2042x1362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913766/realme_gt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GT 5G boasts flagship specs for much, much less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1kjxb"&gt;Realme has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realme.com%2Fcn%2Frealme-gt&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314043%2Frealme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GT 5G&lt;/a&gt;, built with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; chipset. It comes with plenty of other flagship-esque specs, too, like a 120Hz screen, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charger included. What it doesn’t have is a flagship-like price; it’s on sale in China for 2,799 yuan currently, or about $430.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJ8IE"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 is currently Qualcomm’s most powerful processor, announced in December of last year. Samsung has included it in its S21-series phones, and it’s expected to appear in many more Android flagships this year. At the moment, though, only a handful of (mostly pricey) devices are available with it, and with a 100 yuan introductory discount, the Realme GT 5G ties the &lt;a href="https://www.mi.com/redmik40ultra-k40pro"&gt;Xiaomi Redmi K40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; as the least expensive of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOfXSF"&gt;The GT 5G offers a 6.43-inch OLED screen and a triple rear camera array with a 64-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. It comes with 5G and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and sells in three colors, including the striking “dawn” yellow version with a textured racing stripe down the back. While it’s not confirmed whether the GT will be sold outside of China, it might be telling that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/techradar/status/1367487393956311054?s=20"&gt;Realme UK retweeted&lt;/a&gt; coverage of the phone’s announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche’s Taycan Cross Turismo is a wagon-y follow-up to its first EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWo_c5fNu69gbPKPgXRY8JixzNk=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913740/P21_0013_a3_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Porsche&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJFmje"&gt;Porsche has finally &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-first-electric-cross-utility-vehicle-world-premiere-livestream-23784.html"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the wagon-y sibling of the Taycan EV. Originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17084244/porsche-mission-e-cross-turismo-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;teased in concept form in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and due out this summer, the Taycan Cross Turismo is a more utility-minded version of Porsche’s first EV with a hatch rear, more interior space, greater ground clearance, and off-road-oriented options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o1S7c"&gt;The new crossover EV starts at $90,900, plus delivery fees. Much like the regular Taycan sedan, there are four different versions with increasing price and performance: the Taycan 4 Cross Turismo, the Taycan 4S Cross Turismo, the Taycan Turbo Cross Turismo, and the Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJFfHM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More space than the sedan, with similar performance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZvZUi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; the regular Taycan, all four versions of the Cross Turismo come fitted with Porsche’s larger 93.4kWh battery pack and a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup. Each trim of the Cross Turismo is about a tenth of a second slower from 0 to 60 miles per hour than its sedan counterpart due to the extra size and weight, though the base model is 0.3 seconds quicker than the regular Taycan 4S. The more you pay, the more powerful the motors, with the top-tier Turbo S Cross Turismo reaching a peak 750 horsepower in launch control mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mZIAu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10374938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8YrRho"&gt;The Cross Turismo also offers 0.39 inches (10 mm) of extra headroom in the front seat and 3.62 inches (92mm) more in the rear seat than the Taycan sedans. There’s more space throughout, really, thanks to the hatch and the fact that the Cross Turismo is about a half-inch longer and an inch taller than the sedan. That results in a few extra cubic feet of storage in the Cross Turismo, too, though the front trunk remains the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxDlE4"&gt;The Cross Turismo isn’t really&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;going to be an off-roader like the &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/39291/rivian-is-not-messing-around-with-its-off-road-tests-of-the-r1t"&gt;forthcoming Rivian pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;the Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, though Porsche clearly wants to make buyers &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they could handle some rough terrain if push comes to shove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqywF"&gt;All four versions of the Cross Turismo come with adaptive air suspension, which can be used to quickly raise the vehicle’s clearance by 0.39 inches (10 mm) and stiffen up the ride when in “Gravel Mode.” Switching to this mode also ramps up the traction and stability control and the torque management to make it easier to drive on “loose surfaces” like mud, sand, and — of course — gravel. Beyond that, buyers can opt for an “off-road design package” that adds some black trim around the Cross Turismo and defaults to the Gravel Mode ride height. Roof rails and a bike rack (which would hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313508/porsche-electric-bike-ebike-sport-cross-specs-price"&gt;Porsche’s pricey new e-bikes quite nicely&lt;/a&gt;) are options as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="unzaRI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Driving the Taycan, Porsche’s first electric car ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xEtb8a"&gt;With these wan off-road aspirations, it’s not surprising that Taycan Cross Turismo buyers won’t have to sacrifice typical Porsche amenities or features like wireless Apple CarPlay, or the same kinds of upgrades found on the Taycan sedan (adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, heads-up display, 14-way adjustable massage seats, Bose and Burmester audio systems, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EikHvc"&gt;This was essentially the core promise when the Cross Turismo debuted: a slightly bigger, more SUV-ish version of what was then called the Mission E. And while some people may be disappointed that the final production Cross Turismo doesn’t look as ready to rally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17084244/porsche-mission-e-cross-turismo-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;as the concept did&lt;/a&gt;, it should certainly help Porsche sell more EVs until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18240862/porsche-macan-electric-ev-production-taycan"&gt;its legitimately popular SUVs make the switch to electric power, too&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo II: Resurrected will let you import your 20-year-old savegames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVgjNxXuQ7Tc8erAmG6ex6Avtbk=/0x173:1280x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913413/diablo_2_boxart.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LW1o0t"&gt;Blizzard wasn’t kidding &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;when it told &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the new remastered &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; would be faithful to the original. You’ll even be able to pick up where you left off with your 20-year-old savegames, &lt;a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/182380/interview/what-it-takes-to-remaster-a-cult-classic-like-diablo-ii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDkPOq"&gt;“Yes! Yes, keep those!” producer Matthew Cederquist told journalists, saying that the team called it “the best feature ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsB8XE"&gt;As a lapsed player myself, the very idea is giving me chills — dangerous ones, ones that I imagine are akin to what Gollum felt in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;when he decided to pull The One Ring off his brother’s throttled corpse. I thought I could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048"&gt;safely leave this game behind&lt;/a&gt;, but no. It seems I may need to track down an old friend soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hWt3bj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Staying the hell away from this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True story: I had to give my fairly valuable account and discs to a friend sworn to never, ever return them, because I kept seeing unique items in my dreams&lt;a href="https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH"&gt;https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHb5Hj"&gt;For the rest of the original game’s fanbase, though, this might be incredible news: players like me spent large amounts of time grinding &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;’s bosses and levels to dust searching for unique items, not to mention selling them online and trading them inside a game that wasn’t really designed for that sort of thing. (One particular rare item, the Stone of Jordan, was actually used as a makeshift form of currency.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yloqC"&gt;Now, all of that progress is theoretically yours instead of having to start from scratch, and it might even be portable, too: theoretically, the game’s cross-save abilities across PC and console mean you could even load up your OG save on a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCRSO"&gt;Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;told our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the remaster basically &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the original game, so it’s not too surprising that original saves still function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gMbHoN"&gt;This isn’t a remake,” said Fergusson. “We’re not reverse-engineering it; we’re not rebuilding it and trying to make it look and sound like [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. [...] It’s right there, underneath the surface. The entire simulation, the engine for this game, that lifeblood of this game, is [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;] right underneath. So there’s a toggle switch, a legacy toggle, that when you press the button, you’ll see behind the curtains, and there is &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; in 2D sprites running right there, and you can play the way that you played 20 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5YXDpl"&gt;“[W]e kind of shoved it in and it worked!” the team told&lt;em&gt; IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
