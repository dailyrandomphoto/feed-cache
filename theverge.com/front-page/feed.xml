    <title>The Oculus Go’s operating system is being unlocked, John Carmack announces</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPcUHc"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441787976191676416"&gt;unlocking the bootloader&lt;/a&gt; of its discontinued Oculus Go headset and giving users full root access. That means the headset will remain useful long after official support ends. The move was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496416463904768"&gt;announced by Oculus’ consulting CTO John Carmack&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped down from his full-time role as CTO in 2019 to focus on his work as an independent AI researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peXOad"&gt;Root access will be achieved by sideloading a future software update, opening the door for anyone to modify and improve Oculus’ original standalone all-in-one VR headset. Facebook originally released the Oculus Go in 2018 before supplanting it with the Oculus Quest the following year. The Go was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299311/oculus-go-headset-discontinued-quest-alternative-app-channel-launch"&gt;officially discontinued in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g3y6fB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This opens up the ability to repurpose the hardware for more things today, and means that a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now will be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.&lt;/p&gt;— John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496418368294914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRBey8"&gt;“We are going to make available an unlocked OS build for the Oculus Go headset that can be side loaded to get full root access,” Carmack &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496418368294914"&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “This opens up the ability to repurpose the hardware for more things today, and means that a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now will be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0E1B2"&gt;Responding to questions from his followers, Carmack said that the initiative only covers the Oculus Go, but that he “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441498667584684034"&gt;hopes it sets a precedent&lt;/a&gt;” for other devices. The unlocked OS is likely to be made available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441498442082054146"&gt;via the Oculus website&lt;/a&gt;, Carmack says, but an official release plan has yet to be finalized. It will consist of the last Go update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441530976539054080"&gt;but with root access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkWuaL"&gt;“I still heard a lot of arguments about what bad things could happen if users had full control of their obsolete devices, but I clearly favor user empowerment,” Carmack explained. The developer has long been a fan of opening his work on titles like &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; for hobbyist tinkering. Most notably, it was the release of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;’s source code in the late ‘90s that has allowed the classic shooter to be hacked into dozens of unusual devices &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/07/26/playing-doom-on-an-atm/"&gt;from ATMs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/doom-player-gets-game-running-dslr-camera/#:~:text=In%20the%20grand%2C%20long%2Drunning,pinnacle%20of%20PC%20graphical%20performance."&gt;digital cameras&lt;/a&gt;. This open-sourcing tradition continued up until the &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; engine, whose source code was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/22/2581536/doom-3-gpl-source-code-availability"&gt;released in 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLQ1fK"&gt;It’s worth noting that Carmack previously said Oculus intended to offer support for USB storage on the Oculus Go with a forthcoming update that never materialized, as reported by &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-go-no-usb-support/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the headset’s release, the developer said support would arrive “relatively soon,” but a year later was forced to concede that a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1192418316473765888"&gt;hardware problem&lt;/a&gt;” prevented the feature’s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psZdYu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwPOTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread feels right at home on Nintendo’s new OLED Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_6_bdFNOLJWkpDw3fp-lqw30Lo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914302/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiViOO"&gt;The most impressive feature in Nintendo’s new Switch model is its seven-inch OLED screen, giving games more vivid-looking colors and deeper contrast. It also has an improved kickstand that’s more functional and versatile than the one on the default Switch. But what’s a new system launch without a killer app? I was able to play the first 90 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, and not only does it look like it was worth the 19-year-long wait for a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, but it might also be the ideal showcase for Nintendo’s new OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOnZ95"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;is coming to the Switch on October 8th, 2021, the same day as Nintendo’s latest iteration of the tablet / console hybrid. There are many games that I’m looking forward to trying with the OLED screen, but &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;looked particularly stunning. Its sci-fi world seems even more fully realized (and creepy) on a display that allows for deeper blacks. The details in the 2D-meets-3D environments really stick out as a result of this screen tech, as do all of the new enemy varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RW9jRpJbjdgScKpByPyEX0VXasY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873307/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPvUk"&gt;Nintendo says the new $349.99 OLED-touting Switch model isn’t faster than the standard Switch or the Switch Lite, but where I might be quick to notice graphical rough spots on my launch unit from early 2017, those quibbles weren’t nearly as apparent given the big boost in image quality that this OLED screen delivers. It’s still a 720p screen, but I was more impressed by the differences than I thought I’d be. Given the boost in contrast, text on the screen was a little easier to read, and the graphics overall look better than I’d expect from the Switch’s aging chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSOIC1"&gt;I played the game in handheld mode, but I briefly tested out the new kickstand. It can smoothly articulate between about 80 degrees to 10 degrees, or so, making it much easier to find your desired angle in tabletop mode when you’re, say, playing on a plane. With this model, it seems like the days of your kickstand snapping off under normal use (whether to actually prop up the console or just to access the microSD card slot) are gone. The newer kickstand still hides the microSD card slot, but you might not be reaching for that as quickly, as this Switch OLED model comes with 64GB instead of the 32GB default amount in previous Switch consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-03q4G2hyVznbC_XAFlBjp2KBRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873312/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0T1OhREsxWOkqO-7BlLZTPoXnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873311/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmzzTq"&gt;Nintendo suggested that I try playing &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;through this Switch’s improved speakers, and they were loud and clear enough for me to easily hear at a somewhat-loud press event. They probably won’t outclass most headphones, but they seemed better at creating a virtual bubble of sound that I felt like I was in the middle of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wuGrIV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo hasn’t lost its step in making stellar &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjx32H"&gt;Regardless of how you feel about these improvements in the OLED Switch, it still feels like a Switch when you’re playing it. And importantly, &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;feels like a &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game. The story picks up right after the events in &lt;em&gt;Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, and — following a quick recap of prior events — &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;drops you right into the game. Within the first 15 minutes, you’ll be chased by E.M.M.I robots, which are fast, tough opponents programmed to hunt and capture Samus. It’s a dreadful feeling, reminiscent of encountering SA-X, Samus’ deadly clones in &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;. Though, instead of guaranteed annihilation, &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;sometimes grants Samus the ability to melee counter an E.M.M.I to get away. It’s tense and exciting. The E.M.M.I robots only patrol fixed sections of the map, gated by strange doors made of floating cubes (seen in the image up top), but you’ll have to get by them to proceed through the game. Of course, there’s a host of new enemy types and bosses, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S9JGt06_G7UfndTmB3BhpWJNPq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873310/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6T4_bklXRliAQVkUPEn8c_Ed35c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873305/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGYBDy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;also wastes no time introducing you to some new tricks and heavy weaponry that’ll help you navigate the challenge. From the start, Samus can slide under spaces that used to require a Morph Ball by tapping the left trigger. And like in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS&lt;/a&gt; (which Nintendo also co-developed alongside &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; studio Mercury Steam), the melee counter is back. If an enemy glistens before an attack, you can hit X to stun them to get an easy hit in. Even this limited moveset in the early game served up some of the most cinematic encounters I’ve seen in a &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game, 2D game or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HU2SkS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; shares plenty in common with its predecessors. Each section of the game has its share of areas you can and can’t access due to your suit’s limitations. There are map download and save rooms, missile and health recharge stations, and plenty of secrets hidden in the terrain. But going through the usual paces, like stopping in a save room or interacting with Chozo statues, which dole out suit upgrades, isn’t the multi-second affair it has been in previous games. Samus runs quickly, and encounters are brisk, yet visceral, aided by solid performance that rarely seemed to dip below a smooth 60 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRAlm0tbUDvm9HRdPjcyru9e1a0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873304/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3YUO5TuyBCF1whkPsDBtonmZUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873308/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ARHR8c"&gt;The series’ signature difficulty is still here, but it’s far less punishing in the sections that I played, thanks to save points being spaced out no more than a few minutes apart. That’s great, given the portable nature of the Switch, where you might be trying to squeeze in a short session on the go. On top of that, the divvying out of challenge and reward in &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;seems finely balanced to the point that it shouldn’t scare off new players or feel too easy for returning veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="q2ZPKb"&gt;From what I was able to play, &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; feels inspired and energetic, not like how I imagined a game that was effectively canceled for over a decade would be. And while a question mark hangs over &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;which was rebooted while still in development back in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;served as a reminder that Nintendo hasn’t lost its step in making stellar &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

    <title>Facebook is ‘pausing’ work on Instagram kids app after widespread criticism </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2n-b-b07qa0qt9aFBkX5DI2pF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914119/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QlrgD5"&gt;Instagram says it’s “pausing” development of what’s been dubbed “Instagram Kids” — a version of the photo-sharing app aimed at children under 13. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri announced the news in a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; today, saying that the Facebook-owned company would continue to work on parental-supervised experiences for younger users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49MUYi"&gt;In a blog post and series of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461230124322828"&gt;accompanying tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Mosseri blames the media and critics for misunderstanding the purpose of the app. “It was never meant for younger kids, but for tweens (aged 10-12),” he writes. In a separate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461237825081353"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, he adds that news of the project “leaked way before we knew what it would be. People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. It’s clear we need to take more time on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgqjCf"&gt;Pausing development of the app comes after &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of damning reports&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook last week. These &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;included a story&lt;/a&gt; revealing how Instagram’s own internal research suggested that the app made body issues worse for teenage girls. Facebook says these reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;mischaracterized&lt;/a&gt; the company’s studies, but it has so far refused to release its data firsthand for critics and supporters alike to analyze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tz1VQD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have to believe parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram - that gives them oversight - than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461233337159688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WROnhh"&gt;In his blog post, Mosseri notes that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting “raised a lot of questions for people,” and says such criticism has led Instagram to introducing a number of anti-bullying features, as well as “exploring” features that might encourage readers to take a break from the app. (Parts of the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’&lt;/em&gt;s reporting that Instagram and Mosseri have ignored include the company’s own researchers noting that users often feel “addicted” to the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmkkUn"&gt;The development of a version of Instagram aimed at younger users was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56757586"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; by a number of groups. Facebook responded to this criticism by saying young people were already active online and it was better that their experience be supervised. The company also said it wouldn’t show advertising on the new app. However, critics were not convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pJIWo"&gt;“Facebook claims that creating an Instagram for kids will help keep them safe on the platform,” Kathryn Montgomery, a senior strategist at the Center for Digital Democracy, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56757586"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;The company’s real goal is to expand its lucrative and highly profitable Instagram franchise to an even younger demographic, introducing children to a powerful commercialized social media environment that poses serious threats to their privacy, health and wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvpuo"&gt;Mosseri notes on Twitter that critics will see Instagram pausing development of the kids app “as a concession that the project is a bad idea.” He’s adamant this is incorrect, adding: “I have to believe parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram - that gives them oversight - than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil 4 VR is launching October 21st, but only on Oculus Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Key Art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNSYmgy2uM6eBBQkn4VEcdaaFdM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913924/RE4_Key_Art_3840x2160.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITQjGb"&gt;A virtual reality version of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 &lt;/em&gt;will launch October 21st on Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtyC7p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396528/capcom-resident-evil-4-oculus-quest-2-remake-trailer-footage-launch-date"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But Facebook and Capcom — as well as third-party development studio Armature — have only offered glimpses of its gameplay, including a short trailer. It adapts the original game’s content with a (mostly) first-person point of view, re-engineering it to take advantage of VR motion controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Screenshot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n9urNa09QPdrDtxcqEL0GVGRAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880730/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_MENDEZ_SHOTGUN_003_2560X1440_Legal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DWxdtR"&gt;Armature’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; makes a somewhat complicated series of small changes the original 2005 horror game. It’s supposed to feature the same narrative content and world design, rather than getting the kind of overhaul &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt; did in 2019. But it’s been re-engineered to work as a first-person VR game with motion controllers. You’ll interact with weapons, items, and puzzles using your hands. Your health will be visible on a wristwatch instead of a screen overlay. And in addition to moving with the analog stick on an Oculus Touch controller, you’ll be able to teleport or walk in room-scale VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ed8T"&gt;The new design could affect gameplay in some notable ways. You can wield weapons in each hand, for instance, and switching between them looks a lot easier. You’ll use a knife by physically slashing your controller at enemies instead of hitting a button. And a gameplay video shows you moving around while shooting, a major change from the original design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAwbId"&gt;The game’s not fully first-person, though. All its cutscenes will be presented in their original third-person format, including ones tied to &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4’s&lt;/em&gt; many quick time events, according to Facebook. Based on Facebook’s description, the game features some surprisingly fast-sounding camera shifts — you can apparently kick a door down with a button, for instance, and see a short third-person animation as it opens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Screenshot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XmSpxkOf1gFJ0U7ceQNEDTSwnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880733/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_CHURCH_PUZZLE_001_2560x1440_Legal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9PuwRr"&gt;Facebook says the original quicktime event placements and animations are going to stay the same, although some of the actions have been “updated” to work better in VR. (We’ll be waiting to see how the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fey8XU0OiWo"&gt;more acrobatic&lt;/a&gt; sections translate to a headset.) Some of the quick time events will involve quickly moving the controllers, while others will ask you to pull their triggers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w59RUz"&gt;Other tweaks would make sense in any remaster. The game’s textures have been updated, and Armature has made enemies less likely to target your partner Ashley, who you’ll spend a lot of time protecting in either version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrnadb"&gt;Unlike most Quest games, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; isn’t compatible with the original 2019 Quest — it’s completely exclusive to the 2020 Quest 2. Facebook also isn’t sharing any potential plans to bring it to Oculus’ desktop platform, nor has it discussed the game coming to desktop PC or consoles, the way &lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; Oculus Quest version &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/myst-vr-remake-pc-vr-release-date/"&gt;later launched outside VR&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re just interested in a better-looking version of the original &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, there’s always the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.re4hd.com/?page_id=104"&gt;unofficial HD remaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBC gets super aggressive in YouTube TV dispute</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtySc2U57Vzw1PJ0hs-l_891Ktk=/178x0:2100x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913813/Image_from_iOS__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banner ads are appearing across select channels.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: NBCU&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEbfOs"&gt;NBC is one of several NBCUniversal channels running prominent banner ads on YouTube TV streams, warning customers that they could lose access over a carriage dispute with Google. The banner lists over a dozen channels that could disappear if a deal isn’t reached by Wednesday, September 30th, and directs customers to &lt;a href="https://youneedchannels.com/"&gt;an NBCU-owned website&lt;/a&gt; offering various ways to pressure Google. These include a pre-written tweet directed at YouTube TV, links to Google’s customer support, and a tool to find alternative providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aal9O"&gt;“Attention YouTube TV Customers,” the banner, which runs roughly every 10 minutes, reads, “YouTube may drop 14+ channels including NBC, Telemundo, USA, SYFY, Brave, Oxygen, MSNBC, NBCSN, CNBC, GOLF Channel, and E!. Go to YouNeedChannels.com and tell YouTube TV not to drop your favorite channels.” NBCU warns that regional NBC Sports networks may also be affected, including NBC Sports Bay Area, NBC Sports Boston, NBC Sports California, NBC Sports Chicago, NBC Sports Philadelphia, SNY and NBC Sports Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nUZwbJ"&gt;Responding via a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google says negotiations are ongoing and that it’s seeking the “the same rates that services of a similar size get from NBCU” and for YouTube TV to be treated like “any other TV provider.” Google added that if it’s unable to reach an agreement it’ll drop its US prices by $10 (bringing its monthly price down from $64.99 to $54.99) while NBCU’s lineup is off the service. Google says that customers are free to cancel anytime and can sign up for Peacock separately for $4.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SB4eqR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-lose-channels-1235074726/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there are several points of contention in the ongoing negotiations. NBCU is reportedly asking for higher rates for its channels than Google is willing to pay, and wants YouTube TV to bundle NBC’s Peacock video streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3s0Ms2"&gt;“NBCUniversal is seeking fair rates from Google for YouTube TV’s continued carriage of the only portfolio offering entertainment, Hispanic, news and sports networks,” NBCU told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. “Unfortunately, Google is refusing to make a deal at these fair rates and is willing to withhold entertainment, news and sports programming from their paying customers. NBCUniversal feels a responsibility to inform our fans that they are at risk of losing their favorite shows if Google continues with their demands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjG6LY"&gt;This is just the latest high profile dispute YouTube TV has found itself in this year. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;during its clash with Roku&lt;/a&gt; it was Google that was the content provider, and Roku that was providing the platform. The situation saw Google’s YouTube TV app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from the Roku channel store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Google to respond by letting its customers access YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;from its regular YouTube app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDWJD3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKArRz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone offers 3D-printed solution for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, Backbone has designed an adapter that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, the company says it isn’t able to mass-produce them right away because of supply constraints and COVID-19, so the adapter design will be released as an open-source 3D printable file. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, Backbone says “we’ll do our best” to send an adapter to users who contact the company’s support team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;The printable files should be posted online “in a matter of days;” we’ll let you know how well the solution works when we can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says Instagram is not ‘toxic for teens,’ despite damning WSJ report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrW4hwEY_x6dAXJumMMTl6Ekgz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913270/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRKUhm"&gt;Facebook has fired back nearly two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Instagram made body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls according to Facebook’s own data. The &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;salvo&lt;/a&gt; comes courtesy of Pratiti Raychoudhury, Vice President, Head of Research at Facebook. Raychoudhury’s post on Facebook’s Newsroom claims that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s characterization of internal research is “not accurate” and blames it all on a poor interpretation of the data the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has in its possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpr6Uv"&gt;On September 14 &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journa&lt;/em&gt;l published a story to The Facebook Files, which is a series of stories based around an enormous cache of internal Facebook documents leaked to the newspaper. The September 14 piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;focused on data&lt;/a&gt; that suggested Instagram had an extremely harmful effect on teenagers — particularly teenage girls. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; claimed that Facebook was well aware of the harm its products had on teenagers and that the company “has made minimal efforts to address these issues and plays them down in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JROoia"&gt;Facebook has been evasive about the contents of the study cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. But Facebook’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;expected to appear before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to answer for the claims made in the story and plans for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;new “Instagram for kids”.&lt;/a&gt; Raychoudhury specifically cites that hearing as the reason for the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEqCmz"&gt;Raychoudhury ignores many of the issues raised in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece, including that teens claimed they felt addicted to Instagram. Instead she focuses her energies on devaluing Facebook’s own research. Much of the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s most scathing claims, according to Raychoudhury, focus on a study that had just 40 partipants. That would be a paltry sample size by any measure — but particularly when you’re talking about a platform with over 1 billion users. The tiny study was “designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram,” Raychoudhury claims. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q05V1_CL7VTsaWjvRCmFGlenbbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880746/IG_research.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook hasn’t released the internal studies, but did release the slide the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; cited.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MFSrcw"&gt;Raychoudhury also takes umbrage with the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; referring to an internal Facebook slide that claims “we make body images worse for 1 in 3 teenage girls”. Raychoudhury repeatedly notes that the body image problem was just one of 12 possible issues that Instagram could make worse for teenage girls. “Body image was the only area where teen girls who reported struggling with the issue said Instagram made it worse as compared to the other 11 areas,” she writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaL8kL"&gt;Unfortunately neither Facebook, Instagram, or Raychoudhury have released the actual data that she repeatedly cites in her response to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting. Without seeing the data ourselves it’s extremely difficult to assess &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s or Raychoudhury’s intepretations of it. But, you know, this isn’t the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18210473/instagram-self-harm-suicide-cutting-posts-molly-russell"&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872711/instagram-weight-loss-cosmetic-procedures-restrictions-policy-wellness-influencer-marketing"&gt;we’ve heard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/health/instagram-worst-social-network-app-young-people-mental-health/index.html"&gt;about these problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US agrees not to pursue fraud charges against Huawei CFO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returns to British Columbia Supreme Court on August 18, 2021, in Vancouver, Canada, during her last extradition hearing." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQFgAPJZkOf73pWuG3orRdK7yi4=/0x0:6658x4439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903844/1234750724.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TxP6A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-brooklyn-federal-court-2021-09-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-wanzhou-us-court-1.6188093"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported that Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou would appear in a Brooklyn federal courtroom today via streaming video and enter a plea regarding US charges against her. Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18128057/huawei-cfo-canada-arrest-iran-sanctions-violation"&gt;arrested the Chinese executive in December 2018&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of violating US sanctions, and she has remained there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18134938/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-bail-house-arrest-us-china"&gt;on house arrest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, fighting US attempts at extradition. Hearings in her extradition case ended in August, with the ruling scheduled for October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lrgI9"&gt;Meng was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;indicted on fraud charges claiming the Chinese technology and telecommunications company misrepresented its relationship with an Iranian affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, along with accusations it stole intellectual property from T-Mobile. The &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-charged"&gt;13-count indictment&lt;/a&gt; named Meng, Huawei, and two of its subsidiaries — Huawei USA and Skycom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKwrEt"&gt;On Friday afternoon, Meng pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors submitted a statement of facts (&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1436211/download"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) asserting that in 2013 she told financial institutions the Iranian company Skycom was a partner of Huawei while knowing that Skycom was owned and controlled by a Huawei subsidiary to act as its agent in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDDhgV"&gt;As part of the deal in making this admission, the prosecution says “Meng has agreed to the accuracy of a four-page statement of facts that details the knowingly false statements she made to Financial Institution 1.” They are withdrawing their request for extradition from Canada, and as long as she doesn’t commit any other crimes the charges will be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KMWho"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-deal-with-huawei-executive-11632494001?st=n81fv8iy9e669cs&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Justice Department officials under the Biden administration revisited negotiations that had broken down under President Trump. Its sources report that Huawei itself is not a part of the deal and will continue to fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185771/huawei-trade-secrets-charges-federal-investigation"&gt;its charges of fraud and trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt;. A Huawei spokesperson said in a statement that “We look forward to seeing Meng Wanzhou returning home safely to be reunited with her family. Huawei will continue to defend itself against the allegations in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iX1H25"&gt;On Saturday afternoon, Meng landed in Shenzhen where &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/26/china/meng-wanzhou-china-arrival-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports she was greeted by crowds on the tarmac, as well as messages of support lighting up skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9x9vnr"&gt;A former Canadian diplomat told the &lt;em&gt;CBC &lt;/em&gt;he expected her release would lead to China deporting two Canadians it arrested and charged with espionage following Meng’s arrest. On Friday night, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/24/asia/canada-china-kovrig-spavor-release-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s confirmation that the two men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, had been released from custody and on Saturday Trudeau tweeted pictures after meeting them at an airport in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uBr6NN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome home, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. You’ve shown incredible strength, resilience, and perseverance. Know that Canadians across the country will continue to be here for you, just as they have been. &lt;a href="https://t.co/1UoLbBFGNv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1UoLbBFGNv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1441799271217606657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIHHw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 3:24PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Meng’s court appearance, not guilty plea, and prosecution agreement details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm5s3l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 4:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add details from the plea and deferred prosecution agreement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycx39V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 26th, 5:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Huawei, along with details about the returns of Meng Wanzhou, Michael Kovrig, and Michael Spavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Tragedy of Macbeth, Invasion, Spencer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2Lj3hmq4oj5SpdBYQx4U0LHCcY=/25x0:1417x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69911945/denzel.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Denzel Washington stars in The Tragedy of Macbeth | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZcLLAx30Pw&amp;amp;ab_channel=AppleTV" target="_blank"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vzZ8dn"&gt;We’re nearing the season finale of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; (only two more new episodes!), and it seems like the show’s got a lot of story threads that need to be knitted together after episode 10. Titled &lt;em&gt;No Weddings and a Funeral&lt;/em&gt;, episode 10 was solid, but I didn’t quite love it.  I’m trying to write about the episode without spoiling it, let’s just say I didn’t love how the session between Ted and Sharon which we’ve been waiting for all season was edited together with Rebecca’s retelling of a traumatic event with her own father. Jason Sudeikis and Hannah Waddingham were both so great, but editing the scenes together kind of killed the dramatic momentum. But! New plot twists suggest a cliffhanger of a season finale is coming in two weeks’ time. I’m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5khZie"&gt;Here are the new trailers for this week: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SNa6hf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HM3hsVrBMA4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YW9aRk"&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVK24F"&gt;This black-and-white adaptation of Shakespeare’s Scottish play stars Denzel Washington as Macbeth, Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth, and is directed by Joel Coen. It looks stunning (this trailer is simply far too short) and it’s fascinating (to me, anyway) that it stars two actors much older than the usual casting we see for &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;’s lead roles. I don’t generally have an opinion on whether it’s “better” to watch a movie at home versus in a theater (which I know is a touchy subject these days), but it seems like an undertaking of this magnitude should be viewed on the biggest screen possible. &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth &lt;/em&gt;comes to theaters December 25th and to Apple TV Plus January 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2e6Be"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hgsUzL75Yjk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z8r8mF"&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KgwgbS"&gt;The latest teaser from the show’s fourth season shows a family we don’t yet know in what appears to be a very haunted house sometime in the 1950s. We also get a glimpse of the &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; kids (it’s been a long time, are they still kids?) breaking in to the apparently abandoned house many years later. What happened at this house, what’s up with that clock, and what does it have to do with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB2GYwbIAlM&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;Hopper in Russia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILwLN6hV-X8&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;Eleven&lt;/a&gt; listening? We will have to wait until 2022, because that’s all Netflix is giving us at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAc3SN"&gt;There were a slew of new teasers, trailers, and clips for other Netflix shows and movies unveiled Saturday during its Tudum event, including the star-studded &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op_v2PHDn-0&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  the &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; spin-off/prequel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ith2WetKXlg&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a few trailers for season 2 of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, season 4 of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2FG-KIgX2o&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (finally!), season 2 of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgSGrdL4SE&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (it was inevitable) and season 2 of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX7j0TjkxPE&amp;amp;t=3s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the rest of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/25/22691543/netflix-tudum-trailers-news-witcher-sandman-cowboy-bebop-bridgerton"&gt;Netflix trailers in this excellent roundup&lt;/a&gt; by Jay Peters and Andrew Webster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptqd4J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaeA9x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlaHxL3mHAU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4JUMEP"&gt;Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R36fYV"&gt;Five regular people in different parts of the world deal with an invasion by something “not of our Earth,” the president says in an address to her fellow Earthlings. The trailer hints that for some of the people, their encounters with the aliens aren’t their first such encounters. Intrigue! Shamier Anderson, Golshifteh Farahani, Sam Neill, Firas Nassar, and Shioli Kutsuna star in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. The first three episodes of the series will drop on Apple TV Plus October 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xe7mXA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WllZh9aekDg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a8iE3o"&gt;Spencer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PHQ9Wc"&gt;Josh O’Connor and Emma Corwin both won awards for their portrayals of Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the Netflix miniseries &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;, which looked at the unhappy marriage of the royal couple. &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, focuses on Diana’s decision to leave the philandering Charles, over Christmas weekend in 1991. Much like &lt;em&gt;The Crown,&lt;/em&gt; it adds some melodrama to fill in the blanks of what may have happened behind the scenes, and there is a great deal of positive &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelbrodsky/spencer-trailer-kristen-stewart"&gt;buzz&lt;/a&gt; about Kristen Stewart as Diana. &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9m84dw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7PqRDJiWkU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h6bvz4"&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dAFkrP"&gt;I am not sure why we needed a remake of this story or how it will translate into a series, but here we are, with threats scrawled on mirrors in lipstick, a hoodie-wearing stalker/killer, and young people of questionable ethics doing questionable things. There is nary a hook-wielding fisherman in sight in this trailer, however, suggesting it’s not taking all its cues from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiAlcLlJpQE&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;the (dare I say classic) 1997 movie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer&lt;/em&gt;, the series, comes to Amazon Prime Video October 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will fix issue with ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ feature on iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLKRnPbHw0I_F0fg3laDOs5zFxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69911102/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rVDnX2"&gt;Apple says it has identified an issue where the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature might not work with its new iPhone 13 devices. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212828"&gt;note on its support page&lt;/a&gt; describes the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QP8fBe"&gt;You might see “Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up Unlock with Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3elcIp"&gt;On Friday, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/puglid/unlock_with_apple_watch_not_working_unable_to/"&gt;r/AppleWatch Reddit board&lt;/a&gt; began reporting that they were seeing this problem, and some said they were able to use the Watch unlock feature with other iPhone models, including the iPhone 11 Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDEX1T"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;introduced the ability to unlock an iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that uses Face ID with a paired Apple Watch earlier this year with the release of iOS 14.5. It comes in handy during a pandemic where face masks are recommended in many public places, making it hard for Face ID to recognize you. The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212208"&gt;feature works&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone X and later, and requires both the iPhone and the Watch to have wi-fi and Bluetooth turned on. The Watch needs to have wrist detection turned on and be passcode-protected, and it has to be on your wrist and unlocked for the feature to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="019zJz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to unlock your iOS 14.5 iPhone with your Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403738/iphone-unlock-watch-ios-14-5"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GA5PtA"&gt;Apple didn’t say what’s causing the problem with iPhone 13 devices, just that it will be “fixed in an upcoming software update,” but not when to expect the update. The support page note advises switching off the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature and using your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13 while masked in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
