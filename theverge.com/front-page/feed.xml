    <title>Tesla removes 2022 production date from Cybertruck website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9xAyc"&gt;Tesla has never been fantastic at meeting deadlines, so it’s not too surprising that the company’s ambitious electric pickup — the Cybertruck — is running a little late. Recently, reference to a 2022 production schedule was scrubbed from its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOP5XX"&gt;The Cybertruck was originally announced in 2019, with Tesla promising that the vehicle would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;rolling off production lines&lt;/a&gt; in late 2021. Then, in August that year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;full production was delayed&lt;/a&gt; to some time in 2022. Now, that deadline seems to have been waived, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWy3O"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Ftesla-cybertruck-delayed-2022.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F13%2F22881646%2Ftesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the order page on Tesla’s Cybertruck site previously told buyers: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” Now, it just says: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears,” with archives of the site showing reference to the year was removed &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211219200808/https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#payment"&gt;towards the end of December&lt;/a&gt; 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfuXMn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the chip shortage, pandemic, and design challenges could all have contributed to delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jRMyUS"&gt;Lots of factors could contribute to a delay. These include external challenges, like the ongoing pandemic and global chip shortage (which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;affected all automakers&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Cybertruck-specific problems. The vehicle’s angular look is controversial, attracting awe and scorn in equal measure, but it certainly comes with unique design challenges, like the problem of creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;huge windshield wiper&lt;/a&gt; to cover the mammoth front window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhuzHT"&gt;Ramping up production on the Cybertruck might also be a relatively low priority for Tesla considering its other vehicles have had fantastic years. The Model 3 became the first EV to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;top monthly sales charts in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863751/tesla-delivered-one-million-vehicles-2021"&gt;delivered close to 1 million cars&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 — an impressive 87 percent increase on shipments in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBMyb"&gt;At the same time, Tesla’s competitors are moving into what could prove to be a very lucrative market for electric trucks. Ford committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual"&gt;doubling production of its F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will start shipping in the first half of 2022; buzzy newcomer Rivian finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;started shipping its first R1Ts to customers&lt;/a&gt;; while brands like Hummer and Chevy have their own electric trucks scheduled for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;late 2022&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;late 2023&lt;/a&gt; releases respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="einkVk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck can afford to delay a little, but the company risks losing potential customers as it does. We should know more about the vehicle’s future soon, though. Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1466800941269667841"&gt;promised to share&lt;/a&gt; a “Product roadmap update” for the Cybertruck on the next Tesla earnings call. That’s scheduled for January 26th. Not long to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You should probably buy the Pixel 6 instead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LGdSLx"&gt;There’s a category in the smartphone market that has emerged over the past few years that I’ll call “value flagships.” Buying one feels a little like getting away with something — nearly all the features of a high-end device with a significantly lower price. Phones like the iPhone SE, Pixel A-series, and Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE are classics of the genre, combining the right features for the right price at the right time. With its second entry in the category — the Galaxy S21 FE — Samsung is just a little off the mark on all the elements that would have made this a great value flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn39O7"&gt;The S21 FE arrives very late in the S21 family’s product cycle, taking some of the shine off of the “this year’s flagship for less” appeal. It also offers just about everything you get from the standard S21, with the exception of a couple fewer gigs of RAM, a lower-quality telephoto camera, and a slightly larger screen. But at $699 it’s also not significantly cheaper than the $799 S21. Considering that the S21 is often discounted and that the S22 is likely to arrive soon, the S21 FE doesn’t look like much of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6vhuw"&gt;No doubt, the S21 FE is a good device. Its Snapdragon 888 processor and 6GB of RAM provide seamless, fast performance for most tasks. A 6.4-inch OLED screen offers smooth scrolling with its 120Hz refresh rate. And even with a big, bright, high refresh rate screen, its battery will take you through a full day. It’s just hard to recommend it to anyone when just $100 more will get you the S21 — and $100 less will buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;very good Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8gsWSA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10974661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prj0nwwxLY04hOolUfQvKdyDKFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142237/ajohnson_220102_4951_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE’s 6.4-inch screen features a 120Hz refresh rate, making animations and scrolling super smooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ebxaqu"&gt;The S21 FE features a 6.4-inch 1080p OLED screen that’s bright and vibrant with rich blacks — classic Samsung. Bezels are very slim, and that 120Hz refresh rate makes animations and scrolling oh so smooth. There’s Gorilla Glass Victus protecting the front panel and the frame is aluminum. A quick, reliable optical fingerprint scanner is embedded in the display. So far, so flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NYmtA"&gt;The back is composite plastic rather than a higher-end glass panel, but such is the case with the S21, too. The S21 FE’s camera bump is plastic rather than the metal finish that bleeds into the chassis on the S21, so that’s a little bit of a value concession. But with the other high-end components and a lovely screen to look at, this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4bMoF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77bVrJ"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery on board that easily lasted through a day of moderate use in my testing. Power users may find themselves in the single digit battery percentage at the end of a day, especially with the screen smoothness setting at its 120Hz default. There’s no option for a variable refresh rate, which would help conserve battery life while using the higher refresh rate setting — just standard 60Hz or 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBI0QS"&gt;The S21 FE supports 15W fast-ish wireless charging and faster 25W wired charging. A power adapter is not included in the box — just a USB-C cable. The S21 FE doesn’t support fast charging over a computer’s USB port, so if you want the best speeds and don’t have a compatible power brick on hand you’ll need to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Biaoqfwf-uQICSE7ZkUWEE1Njo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142240/ajohnson_220102_4951_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall performance is excellent with a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zJNxzG"&gt;The S21 FE includes the same top-notch Snapdragon 888 processor as the rest of the S21 series, but offers 6GB of RAM as the base model option compared to the S21’s 8GB. I didn’t see this having any significant impact in day-to-day use; the S21 FE opens apps quickly and jumping between them is seamless. The phone got warm playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; but kept up with the action. The only place I notice a bit of lag is in the live preview using portrait mode on the camera, but that’s a processing-intensive mode and I wouldn’t expect seamless rendering. For most purposes, performance is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8lCvT"&gt;The S21 FE ships with Android 12-based One UI 4.0 and all of the new system customization options it has to offer. If you set a photo as your wallpaper, the phone will suggest a complementary color palette to apply to buttons and icons. You can also scale and adjust your homescreen and lock screen wallpaper independently. Best of all, the stock weather app no longer features conspicuous ads at the top of the screen — just some links to clickbaity Weather Channel articles toward the bottom, which I can live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIOLTVTm2NWjrnGvIuBEYYNbNc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142239/ajohnson_220102_4951_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE offers the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S21, but its ultrawide and telephoto modules are different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0mkTWc"&gt;The S21 FE features the same main rear camera — a 12-megapixel f/1.8 module with optical stabilization — as the standard S21. The telephoto camera is different, though, with a much smaller 8-megapixel sensor and 3x optical zoom rather than the S21’s 64-megapixel 3x hybrid digital / optical zoom. Still, it’s a stabilized, true optical telephoto camera, and those aren’t exactly guaranteed in the under-$800 class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uM488"&gt;It is possible to take 30x hybrid zoom images with the S21 FE, but the camera is working with a lot less data than the S21, so photos at that length look (predictably) like watercolors. Photos at the native 3x zoom look much better — even in dim indoor lighting, I managed to get some acceptably sharp portrait mode photos with the zoom lens. That is no small feat for a tiny sensor. Personally, I’d prefer if the main camera was the default for portrait mode rather than the zoom, but that might be just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T20DTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10974713"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6QDwUg"&gt;The S21 FE’s main camera performs well overall. Photos are bright and saturated, as we expect from Samsung, and night mode renders an impressive amount of detail, provided your subject isn’t moving. It can’t quite match the Pixel 6’s camera for detail retention, in either night or standard shooting modes, and the S21 FE’s warmer, more saturated look isn’t my favorite. It’s not the very best camera in its class, but it does a reliably good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilOpdJ"&gt;There’s an ultrawide camera, too, which is slightly less wide than the S21’s. The 32-megapixel front-facing camera is a fixed-focus affair, whereas the S21’s selfie cam offers autofocus. The first time you use the selfie camera it asks you to choose between “natural” and “bright” color tones. As someone who prefers the natural setting, I appreciate that I didn’t have to dive into the menu to find it. Both the ultrawide and selfie cameras do their jobs just fine, and I don’t suspect that prospective S21 FE owners will care too much about the differences between them and their S21 counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upwKDy-O6wfAM0xYH8HjK7xtxsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142236/ajohnson_220102_4951_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The components are right, but the price and timing leave the S21 FE in a strange spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kzftDP"&gt;Despite all of those positive qualities I just ran through, the S21 FE is a fine phone that makes sense for very few people. Those who don’t have any particular allegiance to Samsung would probably be very happy with the Pixel 6 for $100 less. It meets or exceeds the S21 FE’s capabilities in just about every way — it has a better camera, is built with premium materials on the front and back, includes a little more RAM, and offers comparable performance from its new Google-designed Tensor chip. True, you don’t get a telephoto camera (that’s reserved for the $899 6 Pro) and its top screen refresh rate is 90Hz, not 120Hz. If those features are worth an extra $100 to you, then consider the S21 FE. All others should proceed to the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3oYv9"&gt;If you are a committed Samsung Fan, then you probably don’t mind paying an extra $100 for the S21 to get an extra couple of bells and whistles. In fact, you probably have already. With its lower cost and composite back panel, the S21 is kind of already the Fan Edition of the S21 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gd7HcD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCn61A"&gt;Still, there’s something to be said for a phone with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;very good support policy&lt;/a&gt; (three major OS updates and four years of security updates), a decent telephoto camera, and (mostly) top-shelf components that costs well under $1,000. I’d typically steer potential buyers to the Pixel phone for faster software updates, but Samsung appears to be committed to at least getting the major OS updates out earlier than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RTjIxP"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives. If you’ve held off this long waiting for it and you don’t want to wait another few weeks to see what the S22 might offer, then by all means buy this phone. But if you’re more of a casual observer than a fan, I don’t think this is the device for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC earmarks record $44 billion for chip manufacturing expansion in 2022  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_An3tBe8ijlf_XkLLLNYNqqtnco=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382501/1235442625.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IS1Fsl"&gt;Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which supplies silicon for Apple, Qualcomm, and other tech giants, plans to spend as much as $44 billion to increase its manufacturing capacity in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-q4-profit-rises-164-record-beats-market-forecasts-2022-01-13/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In its latest earnings release, the Taiwanese firm said it expects capital spending to be between $40 and $44 billion in 2022, up from a previous record of $30 billion in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NvrwD"&gt;It’s not an entirely unexpected increase, given the company’s previously announced plan to spend $100 billion on expanding its manufacturing capacity through 2023. But the record sum suggests it doesn’t expect demand for chips to slow down anytime soon, despite some analyst warnings of potentials slowdowns in areas like smartphones, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56f339cc-2c8f-41f0-b685-4a7875eb90f4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaGICn"&gt;TSMC’s reasoning is that any slowdown will be made up by more product categories like cars and factory equipment starting to require high performance silicon. “We observe end-market demand may slow down in terms of units, but silicon content is increasing,” said the company’s CEO CC Wei, in comments reported by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GWqUvx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Up from $30 billion in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QixjVZ"&gt;TSMC expects demand to remain high regardless of whether the global chip shortage continues, with Wei noting that it “may or may not persist” in 2022, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/TSMC-plans-to-spend-record-44bn-on-capacity-expansion-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company expects overall chip manufacturing industry revenue to grow 20 percent this year, but that TSMC will outperform it with revenue growth in the high-20 percent range. Its revenue grew by 25 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABF7A6"&gt;TSMC expects this growth even as one of its customers, Intel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595002/intel-qualcomm-chips-foundry-services-amazon-aws-20a"&gt;starts competing with the company’s&lt;/a&gt; contract chip manufacturing business under its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;new CEO Pat Gelsinger&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-13/tsmc-announces-a-budget-of-44-billion-a-warning-sign-to-any-chip-challengers?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Tim Culpan&lt;/a&gt; on why Intel is unlikely to be a direct challenger to TSMC (or its closest competitor Samsung) anytime soon: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="M5DSEM"&gt;“Intel trails both of them in technology prowess, forcing the California company into the ironic position of relying on TSMC to produce its best chips. Gelsinger is confident that he can catch up. Maybe he will, but there’s no way the firm will be able to expand capacity and economies of scale to the point of being financially competitive. Put another way, Intel will need to sacrifice margins to gain the volume needed to fill the fabs he too wants to build.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lRSPnk"&gt;Huge demand for chips, not to mention the chip shortage, have helped solidify TSMC’s place as one of the largest and most important companies in the world (in fact, Culpan notes it’s the “largest non-US, non-state-owned enterprise”). And with its ambitious expansion plans, which include new plants in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772167/tsmc-sony-semiconductor-fab-factory-japan-2024-7-billion"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t look like this is likely to change. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has discontinued all Xbox One consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox One S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qgy1x6lDvzje6GXgcOIy5rfTnwk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382421/tpina_160731_1175_0065.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgL2LC"&gt;Microsoft has stopped manufacturing all Xbox One consoles. The software giant originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327330/microsoft-xbox-one-x-s-digital-edition-discontinued"&gt;discontinued the Xbox One X&lt;/a&gt; and digital Xbox One S ahead of the Xbox Series X launch, then quietly stopped manufacturing the Xbox One S at the end of 2020, leaving retailers to sell out their remaining stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTmUJS"&gt;“To focus on production of Xbox Series X / S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,” says Cindy Walker, senior director of Xbox console product marketing, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkz9Ba"&gt;Microsoft’s confirmation comes just as a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/sony-tackles-playstation-5-shortage-by-making-more-ps4-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; suggested Sony had planned to end PS4 production at the end of 2021, but that the company will now manufacture around a million PS4 consoles in 2022. Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880062/ps4-manufacturing-sony-ps5-shortage-xbox-one"&gt;confirmed PS4 production is still ongoing&lt;/a&gt;, amid struggles by both Microsoft and Sony to meet demand for their latest Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M72MZT"&gt;Microsoft seems able to meet demand for the $299 Xbox Series S, though. At the time of publishing, the Xbox Series S is in stock at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xbox-RRS-00007-Series-S/dp/B08GD9MNZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon in the UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-s-512-gb-all-digital-console-disc-free-gaming-white%2F6430277.p%3FskuId%3D6430277%26intl%3Dnosplash&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking just after the launch of the Xbox Series X / S in 2020, Xbox chief &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast"&gt;Phil Spencer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company had built more Xbox Series X consoles than Series S, but that ultimately the lower price point of the Series S would win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRlSHg"&gt;“We can actually build more of the Series S [chips] in the same [chip] die space as we can the Series X,” said Spencer. That’s a key reason for why we’re seeing steady Xbox Series S stock, alongside Microsoft’s decision to quietly discontinue the Xbox One S in favor of its next-gen consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nigeria lifts Twitter ban, says the company has agreed to government demands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS8nBOye7jvdBQ_Z-xJUh8xgrGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382413/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWgZty"&gt;Nigeria has lifted its ban on Twitter, first instated on June 5th, 2021. The Nigerian government says Twitter has agreed to meet all of its demands, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/12/africa/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-intl/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include Twitter opening a local office in Nigeria, addressing concerns over its tax payments, and “managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGTz9"&gt;This last condition is particularly important, as the original ban was condemned by many international agencies as an act of censorship. The Nigerian government banned Twitter in 2021 just days after the company deleted a tweet by the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57336571"&gt;threatened secessionists&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria’s southeast region. Some had interpreted the tweet as threatening genocide for its reference to the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h4PPAk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nigeria has accused Twitter of helping spread “fake news”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KMMmC"&gt;At the time, the Nigerian government &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57368535"&gt;said the removal of the tweet&lt;/a&gt; was “disappointing,” but that other reasons factored into the decision to ban Twitter, including its spread of “misinformation and fake news.” Many nations, including the UK, Canada, the US, and EU members &lt;a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/european-union-us-condemn-twitter-ban-in-nigeria-389797"&gt;condemned the ban&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has previously played an important role in civil movements in Nigeria, including helping to mobilize the &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2020/11/11/endsars-a-unique-twittersphere-and-social-media-regulation-in-nigeria/"&gt;EndSARS protests against police violence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear whether Twitter’s return is then predicated on tighter government control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDvPlw"&gt;In a statement issued by Nigeria’s technology agency, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), the approval to lift the ban was given by President Buhari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpwv16"&gt;“The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12 am tonight, 13th January 2022,” said the statement, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/nigeria-lifts-ban-on-twitter-says-the-social-media-giant-has-met-some-conditions/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJtg48mZ9YBBoQTW09pKgEkiyD48VOILBIwmxG6VeNTlAqvCNG5appWOzG8k_AvhWIgLTLNcZW20bcVDxxHgcCI99jBqzhI_4LRVVcIGfJb-bsQ9zOOwrn3iqVDRAERDyBY4zn7e1ta2upKW0cQcHjxraika7ARarjvQ2LkNjdPq"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Pu3G"&gt;The statement says Twitter will create “a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022,” and that the company has “agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.” Twitter will also “enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals,” which gives police tools to request and retain data on users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G2NXy"&gt;According to the statement: “Twitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the FGN and the broader industry to develop Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYRAWd"&gt;We’ve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market just had another big year thanks to pandemic demand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GGeKwRVLAiyULPqAPFJR6CaeLD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382375/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHhkXv"&gt;The PC market experienced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth&lt;/a&gt; in a decade during 2020, when the pandemic began to force people to work and learn from home. Market research firms &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-5-percent-in-fourth-quarter-of-2021-but-grew-nearly-10-percent-for-the-year"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48770422"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that the worldwide PC market has grown again throughout 2021, as demand for traditional PCs continued during a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaFs5v"&gt;Nearly 340 million PCs were shipped in 2021, according to Gartner. That’s a nearly 10 percent increase over the already unprecedented numbers seen in 2020. IDC puts the figure at 348.8 million, up nearly 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwBxIT"&gt;“2021 has truly been a return to form for the PC,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at IDC. “Consumer need for PCs in emerging markets and global commercial demand remained strong during the quarter with supply being a gating factor.” Ongoing supply issues relating to a global chip shortage mean the PC market “could have been even larger than it was in 2021,” according to Tom Mainelli, an executive at IDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6I0jH8Jc_MbcHsk45zE_XHYdak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23165780/WMGeDrO.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gartner’s worldwide PC market shipments for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLRo5ADRGT7QrsIvdBl_jAX1rrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23165781/T0kMh82.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;IDC’s PC market shipments for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvD8zt"&gt;Gartner reports that 2021 saw the highest shipment volume of PCs since 2013, after a 2017 milestone of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14250946/pc-shipments-gartner-idc-2016"&gt;five years of PC decline&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, annual PC shipment volumes are not expected to decline to pre-pandemic levels for at least 2-3 years,” explains Mikako Kitagawa, research director at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWUkQs"&gt;While the global 2021 figures were positive for the PC market, the fourth quarter in the US was hit by supply chain issues and what Gartner describes as a “collapse in demand for Chromebooks.” This could mean the unexpected PC growth we’ve seen throughout 2020 and 2021 won’t continue this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKL6gd"&gt;The pandemic has revived the PC market for two straight years, though. Microsoft also launched Windows 11 last year, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;declaring “the PC is back”&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the pandemic thanks to a big jump in Windows usage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; have also just launched their latest laptop chips at CES 2022, so expect to see even more new PCs at stores soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox finally supports M1 Macs natively with new beta  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv4a7Da6mIzYtDnjwZyi7U2b_F0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382333/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jy6cmn"&gt;Dropbox’s latest beta has added native support for Macs with M1 processors, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/dropbox-releases-long-awaited-macos-version-with-native-m1-support-in-beta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The addition was confirmed by a Dropbox community manager on the &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/td-p/527743"&gt;company’s forums&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve verified it by installing the latest beta of the macOS app. You can grab it yourselves from &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-desktop-client-builds/Beta-Build-140-3-1903/td-p/570154"&gt;this Dropbox forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59drqh"&gt;The service has always worked on Apple’s M1 Macs, but until now it’s had to use Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer. This allowed the macOS app, which was originally designed for old Intel-based Macs, to run on machines with Apple’s new M1 processors. Offering native M1 support should result in Dropbox having better performance and consuming less power when used with Apple Silicon devices. That said, Rosetta translation is so fast you might not notice a difference in day-to-day use (we haven’t so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BESiec"&gt;Dropbox was one of the last high-profile holdouts still lacking support for Apple’s ARM-based processors. In October there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751178/dropbox-native-apple-silicon-app-m1-2022"&gt;some controversy&lt;/a&gt; after forum posts from the company’s employees suggested more customers would have to ask for a native M1 version before the company would develop it. The outcry that followed prompted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO to publicly announce&lt;/a&gt; that an M1-optimized version of the company’s macOS app would arrive in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGG0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlzIUo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5mAZc705qkg0L06yKrgETfWWVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381863/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Apple App Store scammer AmpMe lowers prices and says it’ll investigate its ‘consultants’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6MVzgbMo5nkWbSiV6DRM2wf2HY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381697/ampme-0616.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nTluDF"&gt;AmpMe &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;a brand-new app that popped up just to scam unsuspecting users out of their money. See the photo atop this post? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9391461/ampme-music-streaming-app-syncing"&gt;That’s from 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when we first covered the idea: an app that can sync up a room full of smartphones into a single gigantic speaker with no fees in sight. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626605370142724"&gt;as App Store scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou points out&lt;/a&gt;, the app looks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;seriously shady more than six years later — if you downloaded it yesterday, it would immediately try to sell you on a $9.99 a week automatic recurring subscription. That’s $520 a year, an incredible sum if you pull it out as a party trick and then forget to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ82b8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626647300669440"&gt;AppFigures estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app has raked in $13 million since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MDwU9J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3. Buy lots of fake reviews on a daily basis (notice the pattern of all these non-sensical reviewer “names”): &lt;a href="https://t.co/VtabR80QkP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VtabR80QkP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626639067238403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s775Xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;As we discussed last April&lt;/a&gt;, it’s ridiculously easy to find scams on Apple’s App Store — just follow the money and look at the reviews.  If you see an app that charges ridiculous subscription fees, yet still has loads of five-star ratings, something might be off. And if those reviews look absolutely fake, and the app’s barely functional, you’ve probably spotted a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvGrI4"&gt;What’s less easy to find: a company accused of scamming willing to stand up for itself.  Most are completely silent, but when we reached AmpMe for comment, we got a reply from its support email address. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="50KOyM"&gt;Hi Sean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lfWoj"&gt;The free version of our app is the most popular version and the vast majority of our users never paid a dime. Given its reception and popularity, AmpMe is a valued app and works as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axaFLr"&gt;To claim that our users are commonly paying $520 per year does not reflect reality. For example, in 2021, the average user that subscribed and took advantage of our free trial paid a total average of $17. If you take only paying users, the average yearly subscription revenue is about $75. Internally, this has reinforced our belief that AmpMe’s pricing is transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPeNZ"&gt;Regarding the reviews, we hear the feedback loud and clear. Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M21Dp"&gt;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met. We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsjEi"&gt;The AmpMe Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeJCu"&gt;We can’t confirm AmpMe’s numbers, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There are at least three other interesting takeaways in that reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8M9j9x"&gt;AmpMe isn’t denying that it hired someone to pump its brand in the App Store. Nor is it pledging not to do that in future. It’s simply pointing the blame somewhere else. Maybe it’s angry its consultants faked these reviews. Maybe it’s just annoyed they got caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S30gXi"&gt;AmpMe is lowering its price as a result of this scrutiny. In fact, the company’s update has already been approved and is live on the store. It’s $4.99 a week now, or $260 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NaPwWS"&gt;AmpMe isn’t dropping its subscription tactics, which the company believes is “transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="x461FP"&gt;I downloaded a copy of AmpMe, and I have to admit it’s not quite as blatant as I expected having heard the news. While it absolutely does hit you with a subscription request the moment you open the app, tempts you into a three-day free subscription, and the little “X” to bypass that screen is hard to spot, the app does at least clearly say how much it’s going to charge in big white letters right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX39v"&gt;And if you do hit the “X” and skip the subscription, the app seems functional — if only as a way to watch music videos from YouTube while you chat with randos or friends, as the sync-multiple-phones-as-speakers functionality is locked behind AmpMe’s paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOpOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Profiting off forgetfulness is common now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nK6Y0"&gt;So the fact that Apple isn’t pulling this one from the App Store (and instead appears to be helping AmpMe clean up the more obvious fake reviews, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t really surprise me. It’s not one of the worst offenders, and the state of the tech industry is that many, many companies profit from the “whoops, forgot to cancel my subscription” phenomenon, including Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfcrqX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;But as I suggested in September&lt;/a&gt;, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, the one that sells privacy as its brand and claims to put customers first, could do a heck of a lot more to show it. It could lead here instead of following. It could stop profiting from people’s forgetfulness, provide automatic refunds when people have been scammed, stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default, and kill off the star rating system that allows review fakes to flourish. Last October, it took one of those suggestions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;brought back a way to actually report App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;. We have more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tpp9cy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zv8a8b"&gt;I do wonder how much more there is to this whole “outside consultants” idea that AmpMe mentions. It isn’t the first company Eleftheriou has uncovered where a seemingly legitimate app that’s been around for years sprouts a new set of fake reviews, and a new screen advertising an exorbitant subscription price that you have to pay or dismiss the first time you launch. (Many of these screens even look largely the same.) I wouldn’t be surprised if there are companies going around shopping this exact service to old apps, in exchange for a cut of the revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/"&gt;It seems like it may not be the first time&lt;/a&gt; AmpMe’s CEO cashed in on an old app, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1V7JC"&gt;If you’ve been approached by such a company, or work for such a company, I’d love to talk to you. I’m at sean@theverge.com. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geico made the Portal ad we never asked for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfm7dO9FE5C432EWb56L-bDwABw=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381646/The_Gecko_Visits_Portal___GEICO_Insurance_0_13_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rawcGT"&gt;We’re still waiting on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452272/jj-abrams-portal-movie-valve-half-life-2013-script-production"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; movie that’s apparently been years in the making&lt;/a&gt;, but if you must see &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; icon / villain GLaDOS in some sort of cinematic, there’s a new Geico ad you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;watch right here&lt;/a&gt; or at the top of this post. Yes, you read that correctly — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;Geico actually made a &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;-themed ad featuring GLaDOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the insurance company even got voice actor Ellen McLain to reprise her role as the famous robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yM8I4S"&gt;If you’ve seen any Geico ad featuring &lt;a href="https://geicocarinsurance.fandom.com/wiki/GEICO_Gecko"&gt;Martin the Gecko&lt;/a&gt; from the past many years (or perhaps forever, it feels like he’s always been a character I’m aware of), this ad will be familiar territory. Martin, armed with an &lt;a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Handheld_Portal_Device"&gt;Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device&lt;/a&gt;, makes a few quips (and of course mentions that it’s possible to save money by switching to Geico), and GLaDOS responds with a few characteristically ominous comments. Martin ends the commercial by jumping into a portal that turns out to be an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HE8tvRzEkg"&gt;infinite portal&lt;/a&gt;, lol. (It seems GLaDOS didn’t tell Martin how to escape such a predicament.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YhguO"&gt;It’s an odd ad. And guess what? It’s not Geico’s only video game-inspired commercial — the company released one in November &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGa89tAWVHs"&gt;featuring &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
