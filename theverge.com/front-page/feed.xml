    <title>What’s the deal with Seinfeld’s aspect ratio on Netflix?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tr38QDwEA3fO4Mo3opK4T0YttM=/220x0:2194x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938051/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_12.53.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUsgWd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;has officially moved over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652391/seinfeld-netflix-october-streaming-wars-friends-the-office#:~:text=Netflix%20will%20dish%20out%20all,on%20October%201st%20%2D%20The%20Verge"&gt;stream on Netflix today&lt;/a&gt;, with a new 4K upgrade that promises to make the show look better than ever. But while Netflix has upgraded the iconic “show about nothing” to even crisper resolution, Netflix is hewing to the same strategy that Hulu and other HD releases of the show have used: a more modern-looking 16:9 aspect, instead of offering the original 4:3 aspect ratio in which the show originally aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt5s2k"&gt;The aspect ratio isn’t a new problem for &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; fans, dating back to the original HD remaster that was produced in 2008 for &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-09-03-seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd.html"&gt;TBS HD’s syndicated reruns&lt;/a&gt;, which were newly made scans of the original film (hence the ability to add back the wider frames that never made it into the initial broadcast) in widescreen to better suit modern televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVBTcGro1otdqJbzeq2DiB7t-xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893973/AWFNFhJ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/3a5r2d/comment/csa0uli/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3" target="_blank"&gt;Captainjoe201 / Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qr3AaI"&gt;But that 16:9 cut is the only one that’s been publicly released in HD; the best versions with the original 4:3 aspect ratio format are the DVD releases, meaning that &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; fans have been forced to choose for years between visual quality and aspect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72i9cY"&gt;When Netflix announced that it would be getting the rights to &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; — and upgrading the series to 4K in the process — there was some hope that the streaming service would go back to the drawing board and create a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; 4K cut, one that rescanned the film in the highest possible quality. A new 4K scan would also have offered the opportunity to restore the 4:3 aspect ratio, offering the holy grail of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; cuts: a high-definition version of the show, cropped as it was originally intended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeV25j"&gt;Netflix doesn’t seem to have done that, though — something that admittedly makes some sense, given the fact that such an undertaking would cost a huge amount of money on top of the already exorbitant $500 million-plus that it spent on the rights. But the service also didn’t take the chance here to at least offer the option to choose between the HD 16:9 cut and the lower-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio, which would have been a helpful compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DNmfx"&gt;The 4:3 aspect ratio isn’t just about nostalgia, either. The wider aspect ratio has a real impact on things like the basic blocking of scenes: in exchange for slightly more footage of the left and right sides of the frame, the top and bottom of the frames get cut off, resulting in the occasional cropped foot or top of someone’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g22wG"&gt;And much like &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx"&gt;suffered a similar aspect ratio issue&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273476/simpsons-original-4-3-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-stream-how-to"&gt;first hit streaming&lt;/a&gt;), the 16:9 cut of the show also ruins some of the jokes: as one Twitter user pointed out, the pothole from the episode “The Pothole” doesn’t actually appear anymore in the widescreen version thanks to the cropping there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3uQlAi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;to emphasize, the titular pothole from the season 8 episode The Pothole is cropped out on Netflix &lt;a href="https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS"&gt;https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6G35eZQymW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6G35eZQymW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brandon (spooky version) (@Thatoneguy64) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5Sed6"&gt;The good news is that there is some precedent for a fix: when &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; first started streaming on Disney Plus, it too was missing an option for its original aspect ratio, but the service eventually did add the option to toggle on the 4:3 aspect ratio a few months later. Which means that there’s the (admittedly unlikely) chance that Netflix — or whoever ends up with the&lt;em&gt; Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; rights next — may decide to offer a similar option sometime in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates iOS 15 to fix the iPhone 13’s Apple Watch unlock bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wLBCOBtLDUiA0PacI26N6Kb1-JQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937923/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FE8LgD"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup just launched last week, but some users ran into a frustrating issue where they couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their new phones while wearing a face mask. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;had promised&lt;/a&gt; that a fix was on the way, and it appeared earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22699884/iphone-13-apple-watch-unlock-bug-fix-ios-15-beta"&gt;in an iOS 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;, but now, the fix is live for everyone as part of the iOS 15.0.1 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64mbPr"&gt;Apple’s official patch notes also say that the update includes other bug fixes, but the company didn’t specify what those might be. The update clocks in at 553.7MB on my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ij7SMRdNePJUekUr58RvZ1-1tL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894075/IMG_1169.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are Apple’s iOS 15.0.1 update notes, taken from my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vL8HJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;In April&lt;/a&gt;, Apple added the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock a Face ID-equipped phone while wearing a mask, and it’s proved to be a handy feature as masks are still recommended in many situations due to the pandemic. With this new software update, it seems that iPhone 13 users who were affected by the bug stopping the feature from working will be able to take advantage of the convenient unlocks once more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does Blink still exist?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1utZfRA0JziZgj02m8ANJxXE7I=/446x376:1810x1285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937882/Blink_Doorbell.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s founder Jamie Siminoff announced a new video doorbell this week, from another company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blink&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="18lTbj"&gt;In December 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/22/16810516/amazon-blink-acquisition-smart-camera-doorbell-company"&gt;Amazon spent $90 million to acquire Blink&lt;/a&gt;, a Kickstarter-funded startup that developed a super energy-efficient chip to power its battery-operated smart home security cameras. In January 2018, Blink announced its first video doorbell. The next month, Amazon dropped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;cool billion on Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a smart home security camera company known for essentially inventing the video doorbell. The writing was on the wall for Blink. It seemed &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-m-a-chips/exclusive-amazon-paid-90-million-for-camera-makers-chip-technology-sources-idUSKBN1FW0BI"&gt;apparent to industry analysts&lt;/a&gt; that it had been snapped up for its innovative tech, which surely would be pumped into the bigger, badder Ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20zGXK"&gt;Fast forward three years, and Ring’s founder, Jamie Siminoff, walks out onstage at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;Amazon’s latest hardware bonanza event&lt;/a&gt; and announces Blink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698612/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-panel"&gt;first-ever video doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. Ring has seven video doorbell cameras of its own you can buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq3LoH"&gt;Huh? Hang on. Why does Blink still even exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZH8qX"&gt;That’s a question I’ve pondered over the last few years, as each company released new products that replicate what the other has. Ring has close to a dozen versions of indoor and outdoor security cameras (in addition to doorbells). Blink had one, now it has four, plus a doorbell. And, as of this week, both have floodlight and solar-powered camera options. These products are all designed to do the same thing: let you view live or recorded footage of action in and around your home. They both use different apps and subscription plans and neither works with the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jll6Mg"&gt;When Blink released its first wired camera, the Blink Mini — a clone of the Amazon Cloud Cam (which Amazon discontinued the month after the Mini launched) — it all began to feel frustratingly redundant. Why take a company founded on innovative battery technology and have them make a product that is the polar opposite and that Amazon already made?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOwLJsG7grGADiedcZKAgooL1YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893873/Blink_Flood_Light_Cam.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink just announced a new accessory for its outdoor camera that turns it into a floodlight camera. Ring has two floodlight cameras. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5wau"&gt;The answer seems to be market segmentation; dividing your target audience into approachable groups in order to sell more things. And it’s something Amazon seems to be embracing wholeheartedly as it continues its pursuit to be all things to all people. As technologist Dave Zatz pointed out on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davezatz/status/1245786507845214209?s=12"&gt;Twitter last year&lt;/a&gt;, “Why do Whole Foods, and Amazon Pantry and Amazon Fresh all exist at the same time? … Ring could be the premium line and Blink standard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOsfwX"&gt;“We’re trying to give options to our customers that meet their needs,” Mike Harris, the COO of both Blink and Ring (as of February 2020), told me this week. “There’s such a wide variety of people out there, and they have different wants and needs.” They also have different perceptions. The skeptic in me does wonder if all the bad publicity Ring received in the last couple of years around its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;police partnerships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon"&gt;privacy issues&lt;/a&gt; perhaps gave Blink a lifeline. Why end &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; smart home brand when &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;smart home brand is slightly tarnished? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T9dNVM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s pause for a moment to compare cameras to diapers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJwp1S"&gt;But market segmentation is a solid business strategy, especially in a highly competitive market like smart security cameras. Let’s pause for a moment to compare cameras to diapers. There are dozens of diaper brands. When you have your first baby, you buy Pampers because they’re expensive and therefore must be the best. When you’re on child number three, it’s Luvs all the way. They’re around half the price and they still hold the poop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ33Rd"&gt;Do you stop to consider that both brands are owned by Procter &amp;amp; Gamble? Do you care? Most people probably have no idea that Blink is actually a part of Ring (Harris explained that while Blink is an independent company, it is now inside Jamie Siminoff’s organization). They just choose the camera brand that works for them — or, perhaps more accurately, the one that’s been marketed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OZ4wV"&gt;To be fair, Ring and Blink do offer different solutions to the same problem and can suit different customers in different ways. Blink is very low cost and seems to be getting cheaper (a $49.99 doorbell is really cheap). It’s also a very basic — and therefore simple — security camera system. It has fewer features than Ring’s cameras (no person detection, for example) and poorer video quality (no HDR imaging and really bad night vision), but its app is easier to use than Ring’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km6X0p"&gt;The biggest difference is battery life. You can stick four of Blink’s compact, easy-to-mount, battery-powered cameras around your home with just a drill and a Wi-Fi connection in under 30 minutes, and you won’t have to worry about charging or replacing the batteries for one to two years. That’s about six times less often than you’ll be charging one of Ring’s Stick Up Cams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BakA8n2kpgXKlyLE_Ma0H89C00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893902/Blink_Doorbell_on_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink’s new video doorbell runs on batteries, or can be fully wired, and is $10 cheaper than any of Ring’s offerings. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhYnl"&gt;Blink’s core technology revolves around a proprietary chip that can keep a camera running on two lithium AA batteries for up to two years — something no other security camera has managed to replicate. Yes, competitors’ cameras — including Ring’s — have better video quality, but that doesn’t do you any good if you don’t remember to take it down and charge it every four to six weeks. (Seriously, who has time for that? It’s my &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, and I don’t have time for that.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VzlGp"&gt;Blink also offers free, local storage — which puts it squarely in competition with another popular budget smart home camera company, Wyze. While Ring has introduced a local storage option with its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features'"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an expensive upgrade, and you still need to pay a monthly subscription fee to Ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUVj6z"&gt;Ring and Blink are basically siblings, and Amazon’s approach appears to be to let them fight it out and see what transpires. “The sibling description is a good one,” says Harris. “We do collaborate, we also push each other. Innovation comes from everywhere and this allows unique ideas to come out and serve the different customer bases that each brand speaks to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aIfX7"&gt;But this begs the question, why not pool those resources? Why not use their combined talents — the innovation and market reach of Ring and the impressive chip technology of Blink — to make the best cameras they can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df1zLS"&gt;Rather than produce the best of the best here, it appears Amazon has opted for conglomeration over consolidation. While that’s not always a bad thing — more choice equals more competition, lower prices, and more innovation — in the smart home in particular it’s frustrating for users. No cross-pollination between these sibling brands means you can’t use a Blink camera up in a tree to check on that wily squirrel and a Ring video doorbell to keep an eye on porch pirates, without having to use two different apps and pay two different subscription fees. Amazon makes you pick your favorite, something no parent should ever do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung seems to have pulled ads from its stock apps, as promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iK-zTZXdmvR9TN-K27PatJ34jbI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937843/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_21.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dMU5Lz"&gt;A major annoyance of using a Samsung phone is finally getting fixed, as the company seems to have finally pulled ads from some of its stock apps. One &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer reports that they aren’t seeing ads in the Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Health apps, though they said they had to force quit and reopen the Health app to remove the ad banner. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says that it’s seeing that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/samsung-ads-apps-removed-october/"&gt;ads have been removed as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dntcw"&gt;The move is expected — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed"&gt;had promised in August&lt;/a&gt; that it would remove ads from apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme “later this year” — but it’s good to see that Samsung is following through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo3Dgz"&gt;When asked for comment, Samsung didn’t confirm that the removals were effective now, pointing to the same statement about the changes it gave to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August. However, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/samsung-ads-apps-removed-october/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TizenHelp&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that a Samsung employee confirmed the changes to Samsung Health in a forum post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUWksl"&gt;Anyone who owns a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 should consider becoming a PlayStation Plus subscriber — it’s one of the best deals in gaming, after all. Thankfully, if you’re not currently a subscriber or want to extend your membership, you can pick up a year of PS Plus at &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePSPlusSale100121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgames-key-shop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba for $37&lt;/a&gt; by using promo code &lt;strong&gt;VergePSPLUS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Once subscribed, you’ll be able to take advantage of a variety of perks, including 100GB of cloud storage, online multiplayer, exclusive member discounts, and free monthly titles. If you own a PS5, you’ll also be able to play select PS4 games like &lt;em&gt;God of War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;through the PS Plus Collection.

&lt;p id="YvssfU"&gt;If you’re looking for a new pair of headphones, the Sony WH-XB900N offer many of the same features as newer, more expensive models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; — including USB-C charging, touch-based controls, and 30 hours of battery life — at a fraction of the cost. The wireless, noise-canceling headphones also offer integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and though their noise cancellation won’t be as effective as on Sony’s flagship models, the midrange on-ears should still suffice if you’re simply trying to drown out some of the noise around you. Normally $248, the wireless, noise-canceling headphones are currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RM8WQ8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724683993194110376" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $148, their best price of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QKv69d"&gt;The versatile Lenovo Yoga 9i was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently touted&lt;/a&gt; as one of our favorite alternates to the newly announced Microsoft Surface Pro 8 and is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748349792668168451#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $1,200 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price since June. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review of the 9i&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Monica Chin noted how impressed she was by the powerful speakers, solid battery life, and excellent performance afforded by this flexible 2-in-1, even if the design is getting a little stale. The discounted, 14-inch model on offer here comes with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. The 1080p touch display is powered by Intel Iris Xe graphics and comes packaged with its own stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vfUyhn"&gt;If you’ve been biding your time on investing in an OLED TV, your time may have finally arrived. Right now, LG’s 65-inch C1 OLED is currently available for just $1,800, its lowest price ever at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGZfoKG1lY#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WG4HKKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the ultra-thin design seen on most OLED panels, the C1 offers a wide array of advanced technical specs. The 4K panel’s 120Hz refresh rate and support for both FreeSync and G-Sync technologies make it a great choice for gaming, and the four HDMI ports mean you won’t have to rely on a switcher or receiver to keep all of your devices hooked up at once. LG’s webOS software also provides access to the majority of streaming services — aside from Discovery Plus — while the fourth-gen Alpha9 processor ensures quick performance across the board. If you prefer a larger model, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WGFKSMW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 77-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WG3243Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch models&lt;/a&gt; are also on sale at Amazon for $2,997 and $5,297, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Blumenthal’s ‘finsta’ quote wasn’t that bad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqcYfoxMT8QuFcn5cnyXtDwmGFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937400/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvDa3g"&gt;When video of a congressional hearing goes viral, it’s often for all of the wrong reasons. Thursday’s Senate Commerce Committee hearing into the mental health effects of Instagram on teenagers was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWwoaJ"&gt;A clip of Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) went viral on Twitter Thursday, contextless, asking Facebook Head of Global Safety Antigone Davis if the company would “commit to ending finsta?” A seemingly absurd and laughable question to anyone under the age of 30. A “finsta” isn’t a Facebook or Instagram product; it’s a slang term used by younger users to describe a secondary shitposting account not beholden to the perfection expectations of one’s primary account and grid. There are no Lightroom Presets gleaning over a finsta post, and only your closest group of friends are permitted to follow the generally private account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mdF8nX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sen. Blumenthal asks Facebook "Will you commit to ending Finsta?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook's safety chief has to explain that Finsta is slang for a fake account. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jMYy5AIZjY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jMYy5AIZjY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Morrow (@morroweric) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/morroweric/status/1443628623576109065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5anlpn"&gt;But if you weren’t watching the hearing, “Will you commit to ending finsta?” was just another symbol of Congress’ inability to regulate some of the most innovative and valuable companies in the world — similar to Mark Zuckerberg’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17224184/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-congress-senators"&gt;“senator, we run ads,”&lt;/a&gt; quip from several years ago. It’s a solid dunk and emblematic of a broken legislative system, something difficult to pass up as lawmakers struggle to pass any meaningful infrastructure funding this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v01IQe"&gt;Unfortunately, Blumenthal &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;understand what a finsta was and offered a proper definition of his own before asking the poorly worded question that’s now taken on a life of its own online. Now, this one bad question has grown into Facebook’s latest reasoning that Congress can’t regulate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="otQASK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Will you commit to ending finsta?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="owYlug"&gt;“Finstas are fake Instagram accounts. Finstas are kids’ secret second accounts. Finstas often are intended to avoid parents’ oversight. Basically, Facebook depends on teens for growth,” Blumenthal said. “Facebook also knows that nearly every teen in the United States has an Instagram account; it can only add more users as fast as there are new 13-year-olds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v46SUI"&gt;Blumenthal’s flub was just one moment in a relatively productive hearing focused on the mental health effects Instagram has on its young users. Thursday’s hearing came on the heels of new reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; that the company conducted its own internal studies, identifying that Instagram was “toxic” for teenage users, oftentimes exacerbating unhealthy habits and encouraging self-harm. The findings prompted Facebook to “pause” development on its long-rumored Instagram for Kids service, an app targeted at users under the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzgenD"&gt;Thursday’s hearing, despite a handful of offbase or uneducated questions, got at the heart of this issue. Both Republicans and Democrats shared similar concerns over the ways in which social media can hurt children. At moments, it felt as though child safety could be one of the first real, bipartisan regulatory blows Congress deals against the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsE9At"&gt;Throughout the hearing, lawmakers noted Facebook’s profit incentives for onboarding young users, increasing the platform’s daily active users and, in turn, pleasing investors. They compared Instagram to a child’s first “cigarette,” hooking them on algorithmic dopamine hits for the rest of their lives through like and follower counts — the social currency of social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0dSUI"&gt;“’IG’ stands for Instagram, but it also stands for InstaGreed,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) told Davis at Thursday’s hearing. “If Facebook has taught us anything, it’s that self-regulation is not an option.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa9Aou"&gt;In the aftermath of Thursday’s hearing, senators unveiled new legislative measures to address child safety online. Markey and Blumenthal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;reintroduced the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bill that would place new limits on the design and types of content for apps targeted to children under the age of 16. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a bill that would establish a new federal tort against social media companies that would allow parents to sue them if they are proven to have caused&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawley-to-introduce-legislation-to-hold-social-media-companies-accountable-for-the-harm-they-cause-children"&gt; bodily or mental injuries&lt;/a&gt; to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rS1l5y"&gt;After Thursday’s hearing, several lawmakers told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/01/here-are-five-takeaways-facebooks-latest-senate-thumping/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they were interested in advancing legislation to tackle child safety issues online while members continue to hash out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22699202/data-privacy-facebook-google-congress-senate-reconciliation-infrastructure"&gt;an overarching federal privacy law&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxqTNY"&gt;“We’ve been talking about that,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  told &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. “This is an issue that we’re going to keep working on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd2quU"&gt;Still, lawmakers have made pledges in the past, promising to &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;rein in giant tech firms over their competition and data abuses. So far, it’s all been talk, and viral flubs like Blumenthal’s “finsta” question only undermine the real work that goes into making real change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1jHI4"&gt;As of Friday, the lawmakers at Thursday’s hearing said that they will continue to investigate Facebook’s internal reporting on teenage mental health. “We’ll do a deeper dive on the documents that we have and review some of the inconsistencies in the answers she gave us today,” Blackburn said to &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3iyrD"&gt;On Tuesday, this same committee is expected to hold a hearing with the Facebook whistleblower who first leaked the documents sparking the company’s latest PR crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAE4Tn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZhXKH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Rife with sexism’: employees of Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin describe ‘toxic’ workplace culture </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AWARD-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnpvlAXo9ZWK3Z-61EIcL26mOqA=/0x0:4497x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932028/1177532676.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M5cUa"&gt;Twenty-one current and former employees of Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin published &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;a damning essay&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday saying the company “turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8xjI5"&gt;Co-authored by Blue Origin’s former head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, the essay describes multiple accounts of sexist and dismissive behavior from some of the company’s “one-hundred percent” male senior technical and program leaders and says “professional dissent at Blue Origin is actively stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Y01m"&gt;The employees accuse the company’s CEO, Bob Smith, of brushing off dissent by discouraging staff from raising questions during internal town halls, asking a colleague to track “troublemakers or agitators,” and forcing out employees for speaking out about safety issues related to Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourism rocket. “Smith’s inner circle of loyalists makes unilateral decisions, often without the buy-in of engineers, other experts, or senior leaders across various departments,” the employees say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEZSqI"&gt;In an interview with CBS this morning, Abrams, speaking out for the first time, said she was fired by Blue Origin in 2019, quoting her manager as saying, “Bob and I can’t trust you anymore,” referring to the CEO. “You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time,” Abrams said in the interview. “I’ve gotten far enough away from it that I’m not afraid enough to let them silence me anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BX5hY7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LaurieSegall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuM1Y"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Blue Origin spokesperson said, “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps3fKG"&gt;The spokesperson also said Abrams was fired “after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations,” a claim Abrams denied to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuERH4"&gt;The essay, published on Lioness, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537102/tech-workers-harassment-hotline-vault-lioness-strategies"&gt;platform for whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;, indicated Blue Origin sometimes overlooked safety issues to favor speed amid heated competition with other billionaire-backed companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX or Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. “Competing with other billionaires — and ‘making progress for Jeff’ — seemed to take precedence over safety concerns that would have slowed down the schedule,” the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzY7wJ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, which manages launch safety and oversees flights of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, said, “the FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6w0H0"&gt;In the essay, the employees also recounted sexism from colleagues, including a former, unnamed executive who would call female employees “baby girl,” “baby doll,” or “sweetheart” and ask about their dating lives. “It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos — it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,” they said. Another passage included: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xu4gi5"&gt;Additionally, a former NASA astronaut and Blue Origin senior leader once instructed a group of women with whom he was collaborating: “You should ask my opinion because I am a man.” We found many company leaders to be unapproachable and showing clear bias against women. Concerns related to flying New Shepard were consistently shut down, and women were demeaned for raising them. When one man was let go for poor performance, he was allowed to leave with dignity, even a going-away party. Yet when a woman leader who had significantly improved her department’s performance was let go, she was ordered to leave immediately, with security hovering until she exited the building five minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="92maFt"&gt;On top of the safety and sexism claims, the letter attacks Bezos and Blue Origin’s record on environmental issues. The employees say while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;Bezos touts his climate initiatives&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Origin has no plans to be carbon neutral or reduce its environmental footprint and that some machinery ordered by the company was done so without considering its waste levels or whether it’d need permits to manage the waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTm5R0"&gt;The employees also described harsh and demanding conditions that have “taken a toll on the mental health of many of the people who make Blue Origin’s operations possible.” The essay cites internal memos, including one that cast SpaceX as a model, “in that ‘burnout was part of their labor strategy.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOIYGB"&gt;On Friday, CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;obtained &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-email-response-to-toxic-workplace-essay.html"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; from Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith to his employees addressing the allegations. Smith said in the letter that the company would “reflect on what we can learn and improve” and that it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjtznr"&gt;He also said, “the New Shepard team went through a methodical and pain-staking process to certify our vehicle for First Human Flight. Anyone that claims otherwise is uninformed and simply incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTP72u"&gt;Blue Origin has struggled with internal strife in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeZf7"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21198272/blue-origin-coronavirus-leaked-audio-test-launch-workers-jeff-bezos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported that Blue Origin employees were outraged by the pressure they faced from senior leadership&lt;/a&gt; to continue in-person work and travel for a New Shepard test launch during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when much of the country was locking down to curb the virus’s spread. Responding to employee concerns in one meeting, Jeff Ashby, the company’s senior mission assurance director and a former NASA astronaut, said: “I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqzov7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 2:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional information from the essay and a statement from the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPK2Gz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 1st, 11:27AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated with information from Smith’s letter to Blue Origin employees. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAEPf6"&gt;343 Industries has added improved accessibility features to&lt;em&gt; Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KczSxV"&gt;“343 Industries’ goal is to make the newest journey into the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe more accessible to as many gamers as possible,” Xbox shared &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-celebrates-disability-community/"&gt;on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That includes those who are brand-new to the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; franchise, as well as those who struggled to play due to barriers that hadn’t previously been accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7ZBAs"&gt;The features include accessibility standards like enhanced colorblind settings and the ability to rebind mouse, keyboard, and gamepad controls. 343 is also adding new innovations like the movement-assisted steering feature, which allows users to add more controls to help steer vehicles like the Warthog and Mongoose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrvg5Y"&gt;Here’s a list of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s accessibility features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bPGDJa"&gt;For subtitles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g02yhh"&gt;Adjust the font size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KHHwLV"&gt;Adjust the background opacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FIAh2H"&gt;Enable color coding of dialogue per speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruHAmT"&gt;Choose whether you’d like subtitles for all dialogue or just dialogue related to the narrative in campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PGVOkN"&gt;General gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wxm8ie"&gt;Customize menu and gameplay font size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3NlqfW"&gt;Menu narration with adjustable narration speed for those who commonly utilize screen readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egBS74"&gt;A new mode called “Linear Navigation” that lets users navigate through the UI without the need to visually see how controls are positioned on-screen to access them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CdijQ"&gt;Option of changing the friendly and enemy colors to include more options than just red versus blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdirg4"&gt;More UI settings, such as HUD (Heads-up Display) and reticle opacity to make it easier to identify information in the HUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U4xyal"&gt;Text-to-speech and speech-to-text options for players that want to participate in voice chat and either need to send synthesized voice or receive voice chat as synthesized text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jnj53a"&gt;New customizations for players to control their sound experience with different volume sliders for a variety of sounds in the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BQE6Co"&gt;Customizability for both controller and keyboard and mouse to rebind keys, adjust sensitivity, and change to taps and toggles versus holds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dSArL"&gt;A new Movement Assisted Steering feature, which lets you use additional controls to help steer wheeled vehicles rather than just the classic “look-to-steer” mechanic 						&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL6ZKm"&gt;Accessibility and inclusion in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; aren’t limited to the game’s settings. 343 Industries partnered with disabled service member group Warfighter Engaged to design prosthetic customization options for players creating their own Spartans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jT1JIQ"&gt;These new &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; features are a part of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVItZfE0FFY"&gt;a greater push at Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;across the gaming industry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system"&gt;to be more accessible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445828/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5-accessibility-toggles"&gt;to players of all abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"&gt;Microsoft launched a program&lt;/a&gt; in which developers can have their games tested and evaluated for their accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7VwAZ"&gt;“Accessibility is a journey,” Xbox says. “And 343 Industries will continue to update &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in ways that empower as many people as possible to battle alongside the Master Chief.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nScNMD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches December 8th. 						&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox is making it easier to find accessible games in its stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox X in a circle logo against a dark background with green lines. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fal-LSEQOdyuUEyYmSuDS7yTH0k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937114/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhhMIN"&gt;Xbox is making it easier to find accessibility information for games, according to an announcement from the company at its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gVItZfE0FFY"&gt;Accessibility Showcase&lt;/a&gt;. Games in the Microsoft store will have accessibility feature tags, so players with disabilities can make sure games have the features they need before buying or downloading them. The tags are appearing in the store for members of the &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-accessibility-insider-league"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Insiders League&lt;/a&gt; (XAIL) starting today and will eventually roll out to all Xbox users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XakC5T"&gt;The tags address an issue commonly expressed by players with disabilities: they often have to do their own research to figure out which games they can play. Listing certain features in the store consolidates information that can be frustrating to track down, especially if it’s not available on developer websites or in reviews. Publishers will also be able to link to additional information from the store. While the tag system is starting in the Microsoft Store, Xbox says they’ll also start showing up on Xbox.com, the Xbox app on PC, and Xbox Game Pass apps in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft store titled “Accessibility spotlight” showing categories for featured games, gameplay, audio, and visual features. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKE_KvgREAIk9ozCwSLZllNQ9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891763/accesibility_spotlight.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new spotlight in the store for accessible games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P81sKZ"&gt;Xbox says it plans to gather feedback from XAIL members over the next month before expanding the availability of the tags. Part of the fine-tuning for the tags involves determining specific sets of criteria that games need to meet in order to be labeled with each feature — a game with subtitles that can’t be resized, for instance, wouldn’t meet the bar for the subtitle options tag. The list of tags includes 20 features, like narrated game menus, input remapping, and single stick gameplay, and more could be added in the future based on feedback from players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PhXlEJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New accessibility features are coming to Halo Infinite ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704024/halo-infinite-accessibility-features-colorblind-steering-controls"},{"title":"Microsoft starts new program to help make more accessible games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b4klEh"&gt;There’s also a new “Accessibility Spotlight” section in the store, with games in different categories based on the accessibility features they have, like audio or visual. Search results will be filterable by feature in coming months, according to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho4QIY"&gt;Xbox also announced several other features that it says will launch soon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EZGX9K"&gt;Quick settings, which allow people to toggle accessibility features on or off without leaving a game or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8o0XbG"&gt;Global color filters on Xbox Series X|S, for people with colorblindness to customize how colors are displayed across games, apps, and menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or0pUC"&gt;Night mode with adjustable filters and brightness, controller and power button light dimming, and scheduling options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uWfjy9"&gt;A free gaming accessibility fundamentals course for developers launching in Microsoft Learn in late October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
