    <title>Kensington’s StudioCaddy is a home for all your Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rycBrR7aOwJrl9DuitSd79rka5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544950/DSCF7728_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy has USB-A and USB-C charging ports on the side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwwjSr"&gt;Following the recent release of the StudioDock, an opulent stand that turns the iPad Pro into a mini desktop computer, Kensington is expanding its Apple-focused offerings today with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179.99 StudioCaddy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unusual product with a simple goal: it’s meant to be the place where all your Apple devices can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnRsii"&gt;The StudioCaddy is comprised of two halves that attach magnetically. The first half is a basic metal stand that you can slot a closed MacBook into, and there’s also a rubberized shelf out front designed to hold an iPad. The second half attaches onto the front and includes two Qi wireless chargers, one vertical for an iPhone and one horizontal with a recess that you can put an AirPods case into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OaHm9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hu7DlM"&gt;You could, of course, use the StudioCaddy with many combinations of Windows ultrabook, Android tablet and phone, and Qi-equipped wireless earbuds. Kensington is focusing on the Apple ecosystem, though — the product’s full name is actually “StudioCaddy with Qi Wireless Charging for Apple Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXi8ru"&gt;The StudioCaddy feels very well built, and each stand is sturdy enough not to get knocked around a desk. The wireless charging stand also has USB-C and USB-A ports for extra power, providing up to 20W over USB-C — enough to charge an iPad (but not a MacBook Pro) reasonably quickly, or even an Apple Watch if you want to complete the set. That’s useful, although the external AC adapter is a little bulkier than I’d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNyZH"&gt;While I’ve found many vertical Qi chargers don’t work with my iPhone 12 Mini, Kensington has included a swappable part that lifts the phone to raise its wireless charging coils to the right level. It’s also recommended for use with smaller phones like the iPhone SE or the 11 Pro, though I found various larger Android devices would also charge just fine with it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k8GSB6lgerRCT9b2dvTboX7sQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700978/DSCF7727_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy is designed to hold a MacBook and iPad while wirelessly charging an iPhone and AirPods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVa9ll"&gt;The main idea with the StudioCaddy is that you can save a lot of desk space by storing all your Apple devices in the same place. In practice, though, I’m not sure that people would need their iPhone charger to be attached to their laptop. Until recently I almost always used my MacBook Pro in “clamshell” mode on another stand, and I put it out of the way to save space, which the StudioCaddy does well. But I’d rather have the iPhone charging in front of me at my desk so I can see notifications coming in, so the benefit of the all-in-one approach is mostly lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh5KY6"&gt;If your desk setup allows it, which mine does not, it could be neat to put the StudioCaddy next to your monitor with your phone facing you and your MacBook in clamshell mode. That’s quite a lot of horizontal space to give up, however. You could also just use the StudioCaddy’s two halves independently of one another, and then you’d be left with a good wireless charger and a good MacBook/iPad stand. But there are lots of other options out there for both of those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL3UUb"&gt;You know your own desk situation better than I do, and I can recommend the StudioCaddy if you think it’d be a decent fit. It’s a well-made, versatile product that does what it sets out to do, and most people with a lot of Apple devices could probably make good use out of it. It’s not cheap, though, so you’d have to be sure it was a better option for you than replicating all the functionality with separate products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAyPeN"&gt;The StudioCaddy will be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; from today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut earbuds will cost $99 and feature noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-_Fwcx6eMrvtBfA8sllXcVU75g=/26x0:7655x5086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544930/Nothing_Design_Concept_1___UNDER_EMBARGO_UNTIL_11_AM_GMT_9_MARCH_2021__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A teaser image for the design of the earbuds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0OkmMN"&gt;Nothing’s debut earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), will cost $99 / €99 / £99 and will feature active noise cancellation (ANC), the company’s founder Carl Pei has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each earbud will be equipped with three mics to enable ANC, the company says, and will be released initially in the UK, India, Europe, and North America following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555247/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-july-27th-launch-oneplus-carl-pei"&gt;announcement on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pBs1G"&gt;Pei, who previously co-founded OnePlus, is using the Ear (1)’s noise cancellation to position the earbuds as a competitor to Apple’s $249 AirPods Pro. However noise cancellation is increasingly common on mid-range true wireless earbuds. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; cost $130, for example, while Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-generation Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; include ANC and start at $120. However, there are still plenty of earbuds without noise cancellation at this price point, like Google’s recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Pixel Buds A-Series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sI3vuI"&gt;Nothing’s founder also used the &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; interview to clarify why the company decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284363/nothing-company-essential-brand-acquisition-news"&gt;acquire the Essential brand&lt;/a&gt;. “[B]efore we were called Nothing, ‘Essential’ was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,” Pei told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “So that’s why we’ve acquired the trademark. We don’t have any plans to do anything with Essential.” The smartphone manufacturer, which was started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shut down in early 2020&lt;/a&gt; after releasing just one phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfmp6q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Still the best Alexa smart display&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dU5SU5"&gt;Amazon’s midsize Echo Show 8 is the best smart display in its lineup. It is larger and more capable than the diminutive Echo Show 5, while costing far less than the larger Echo Show 10. The Echo Show 8 is handy for watching video, listening to music, getting weather reports, controlling smart home devices, making video calls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFaRLc"&gt;So it’s no surprise that the second-generation model, which sells for $129.99 and is shipping this week, doesn’t rock the boat. It’s largely the same smart display as before but with slightly faster performance and an improved video calling camera. It has the same display, same design, same speaker system, and the same set of features as its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4AwORI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10594276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9foDKT"&gt;Improving the video calling capabilities makes sense, given how much video calling has been done while everyone was (and for large part, still is) stuck at home during the pandemic. The new Echo Show 8 borrows the 13-megapixel camera from the flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the pathetically low-resolution, mediocre 1-megapixel camera that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;first gen&lt;/a&gt;. As before, there’s a mechanical privacy shutter you can slide in front of the camera to both disable it and block its view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFPuIrlwrWFjeuL59lsgPIMdw0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641651/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 has the same camera as the Echo Show 10: a large, 13-megapixel sensor with automatic panning and cropping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDKysBbp17RbY5_VoMsDnFGbhFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641652/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still block the camera’s view with a physical shutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0w6AJ"&gt;The improvements in video calls are immediately noticeable. You can use the Echo Show  for video calls to the Alexa app on phones or other Echo Show devices, or you can join Skype, Zoom, or Amazon’s Chime calls from it. In my testing with Zoom calls, the image is much sharper and more pleasant to look at, with better color and much more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBf38a"&gt;The Echo Show 8 doesn’t have the motorized base on the bigger Echo Show 10, but it still can automatically frame you and follow you around as you move thanks to its high resolution. The autoframing isn’t as good as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;new iPad Pro’s Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, and it moves much slower and tends to constantly reframe itself, like you’re the star of a Ken Burns documentary. But the Echo Show is a $130 smart display, not an $800 tablet, so it’s hard to complain, so long as you stay relatively still during video calls. If you don’t want the camera to autoframe, you can say “Alexa follow off” to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhFFL-zRIKWvAcviDEhC60cM2Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641650/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Echo Show 8 for Zoom calls, but it works best for one-on-one calling, not groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rz4Ew"&gt;That said, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. The new camera has a much wider-angle lens, which allows it to do those auto-framing tricks. But it can also cause the image to look distorted at times and isn’t always very flattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfgMMN"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s eight-inch display works fine for one-on-one video calls, but it’s too small to comfortably use for a group call. If you are on a call where someone is sharing a screen, it’s hard to see what’s happening, and while you can view messages posted to a chat, you can’t type any out yourself on the Echo Show’s display. Joining Zoom calls can be done entirely by voice, but it’s much easier to call up the Zoom app on the Echo Show by saying “Alexa, open Zoom” and then typing in a meeting code or starting one yourself from the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlC5v"&gt;I also observed an echo of my own voice in several Zoom calls, both with individuals and group calls, which made it hard to use the Echo Show for anything work related. Other parties on the line also said there was an annoying echo of my voice whenever I unmuted my mic. I reached out to the company about this issue and Amazon was able to fix it with a software update after the original publish date of this review. I tested the Zoom calling after the update was released and did not observe the echo again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC0UQ6"&gt;The new processor in the second-gen Echo Show 8 does make the smart display respond quicker to taps and swipes than its predecessor. It’s not a huge difference, and Amazon’s software still has a long way to go to make it more useful via touch, but when compared side by side, the new one opens menus and screens quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1mSQJrmHJidSIt94JnUkKT_arM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641646/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wedge-shaped design houses two speaker drivers that put out impressive volume for its size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jrpnisdCEE4OSmDMq8WggNLXg74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641644/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon ditched the 3.5mm output jack on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DQ08q"&gt;Elsewhere, the changes are either nonexistent or very minor. The wedge-shaped design is exactly the same; you can still get it in the same white or black color options as before. (Annoyingly, both colors come with a white power cord.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWd2k2"&gt;The display has the same 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, but now it can adjust its color and white balance to the lighting in the room. Like the new processor, the difference isn’t huge, but the new model is slightly warmer and more pleasant to look at when the adaptive color setting is enabled. I’m still more impressed by the ability of Google’s Nest Hub to mimic the look of a printed photo by adapting its color to the lighting in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aOILp"&gt;The dual-driver speaker system is unchanged and it’s as loud and full sounding as the first gen. The Echo Show 8 can fill a small room with sound surprisingly well, and its bass response is better than expected. At times, it might even sound &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bassy, but you can adjust the EQ in the Alexa app easily enough to compensate for that. Unfortunately, Amazon dropped the 3.5mm output jack on the back of the new model, so it’s not possible to hook it up to a larger speaker system with a wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JFRm2"&gt;You can watch Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix on the Echo Show, but Disney Plus, Peacock, HBO Max, and many other streaming services aren’t available. YouTube is available through the Echo Show’s Silk browser, but it’s not as seamless of an experience as available on Google’s Nest Hub, and you can’t easily cast videos from your phone to the Show’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M6IUZ"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s software is the same as what debuted on the Echo Show 10 earlier this year. Amazon is starting to make better use of the display, with split screens that show weather data alongside news, but it still feels very much like a voice-first device. Though the new Echo Show 8 is faster, it’s still a chore to tap through all of the screens to get to the smart home controls, and managing what shows up in the rotating information screens on the display requires a lot of menu diving and trial and error to get what you want. (And even then, you’ll still probably get nagged about new Alexa Skills or other Amazon promotions you don’t care about.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jt6A-bmN6YU57lqXDW6lw4AYY3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641647/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing what shows up on the displays when it’s not being used is a chore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFdANYL11-bM-MdfsbZdGMJXxwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641648/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 is noticeably faster when responding to touch input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlERf4"&gt;There are of course many, many other things you can do with an Echo Show smart display — far too many to cover in the scope of this review. The things that I find it most useful for are weather reports, managing a grocery shopping list, and viewing the video feed from a doorbell or security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiehW"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s main competition is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub from Google&lt;/a&gt;, which has a slightly smaller seven-inch screen and costs $30 less. The Nest Hub supports more video streaming services, has a more useful touch interface, can track your sleep, and works with the Google Assistant instead of Alexa. But it doesn’t have a camera for video calling, its single speaker is blown away by the Echo Show’s dual speakers, and it’s much slower and laggy to use. Ultimately, the choice comes down to how you want to use the smart display and which smart assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJRYq7"&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;10-inch Portal&lt;/a&gt; is another option if you plan to use a smart display primarily for video calling, but it loses to the Echo Show 8 in effectively every other aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyrdjP"&gt;If you do prefer Alexa, the new Echo Show 8 remains the best smart display to get, as it has a big enough screen to read from across the room, doubles as a great speaker, and comes with a host of camera-related features, including the aforementioned video calling and security camera features. It’s also over $100 less than the motorized Echo Show 10, while still providing many of the same features and capabilities. And given Amazon’s frequent discounts, you’ll likely be able to find the new Echo Show 8 for less than its sticker price quite often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SCxH88"&gt;The new Echo Show 8 doesn’t redefine what a smart display can be, but it’s still a very good virtual assistant with a screen for an attractive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pyT1af"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8966487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5aEiYd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 6th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated after testing Zoom video calling with Amazon’s latest software fix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter has lost legal immunity for users’ posts in India, government argues</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crpKYy"&gt;Twitter is now legally liable for content posted by its users in India after failing to comply with the country’s new IT rules, the government said in a legal filing. As reported by both &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-loses-immunity-over-user-generated-content-india-2021-07-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;India’s IT ministry argues in a filing with New Delhi’s High Court that the social media firm has lost its legal immunity after failing to comply with new requirements imposed in May. These include appointing a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer, and a contact person to respond to requests from law enforcement 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r60baz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the court filing came in response to allegations from a Twitter user that they had been defamed by tweets posted on the platform, and that Twitter has not appointed the new executives required as part of the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7CPD"&gt;If the court sides with India’s government, it would mark a major shift in Twitter’s legal obligations in the country, with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; noting it could open the door for its executives to face criminal charges over objectionable content posted by its users. While social media platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;including Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often take down content in response to legal challenges, they’re generally not legally liable for the contents of their users’ posts. Although the Indian government has claimed Twitter has lost this legal protection, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/limits-of-modis-power-to-control-twitter/"&gt;experts have said&lt;/a&gt; that the final decision ultimately rests with India’s courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dNErxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following months of escalating tensions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIo8Up"&gt;In the US, social media companies are generally not held liable for their users’ posts thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;. But India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has argued it’s wrong for companies to expect exactly the same protection under Indian law. “The issue is of misuse of social media,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports the minister said in a press conference last week. “Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable.” Prasad denied that the move was aimed at silencing criticism of the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzK9c"&gt;A spokesperson from Twitter did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment, but the company declined to comment to both &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. Twitter has previously said it was making efforts to comply with India’s new Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which came into force in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0DYdo"&gt;Tensions have been rising between Twitter and the Indian government for several months. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;police in India raided Twitter’s offices&lt;/a&gt; as part of an investigation into why the company labeled tweets from government officials as “manipulated media.” Last month, the country’s technology minister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;warned Twitter of “unintended consequences”&lt;/a&gt; if the company did not comply with its new regulations, and gave it “one last notice to immediately comply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRfooJ"&gt;Other big tech companies have also clashed with Indian authorities over its new regulations. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the Indian government&lt;/a&gt; over the new rules, claiming they are unconstitutional and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users. WhatsApp’s concerns relate to a requirement that it track the origins of objectionable messages. The service argues that this would effectively force it to “trace” private messages sent on its platform, ultimately breaking the service’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about Karateka’s 37-year-old easter egg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="1984 Apple II game Karateka booted upside down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQmZzLbAz2Qq5p6UwebcL-wHWFA=/248x0:2615x1578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543439/Screen_Shot_2021_07_05_at_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geek With Social Skills&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YguQH0"&gt;Karateka, an early martial arts side-scroller published in the US by Broderbund in 1984, was a little before my time. It was created by Jordan Mechner before he went on to make Prince of Persia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— a game I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember thanks to the horror of sending that character to a bloody, pixelated death on a bed of spikes. Karateka however was an early hit, with later iterations making it to NES and Game Boy. And the original Apple II version included a delightful little easter egg from the early days of PC gaming — putting in the floppy disk upside down would boot up the game upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJHGjv"&gt;This isn’t new exactly — people have been trying this trick for more than 35 years — but it was new to me, and I got a quick refresher today thanks to the magic of YouTube. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC81jebcnijA535zPWGZn6qw"&gt;YouTuber Geek with Social Skills&lt;/a&gt; was demoing the game, and got a note that he should try inserting the game disk upside-down. You can see for yourself what happened when he gave it a try — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WNYrikbtcY&amp;amp;t=169s"&gt;the title screen, intro, and game all display upside down&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a delightfully simple joke, and it took a surprising amount of coding to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc9HFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/184477/this-is-the-greatest-easter-egg-of-all-time-only-on-the-apple-ii/"&gt;According to Mechner&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s developers hoped that a few people would discover it by accident, and think their game was defective. “When that person called tech support, that tech support rep would once in a blue moon have the sublime joy of saying, ‘Well sir, you put the disk in upside-down,’” Mechner was quoted as saying in a recent profile, “and that person would think for the rest of their life that’s how software works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeFwEw"&gt;Developers, we now know, have had a weird sense of humor forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5GTj"&gt;Mechner says that he &lt;a href="https://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19585"&gt;didn’t think Broderbund would sign off on it&lt;/a&gt; because it would require a change to the assembly line. But the company did, and a little hidden gem of gaming history was made because the president of a software company had a sense of humor, too. I, for one, am grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hong Kong’s new anti-doxxing proposal could put tech companies at risk, says new letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A crowd of people wearing facemasks hold up signs in support of Hong Kong." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNCyI4IsS-IfIkK7X3CsxmFKWMo=/7x0:4144x2758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543423/1233762251.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Supporters of democracy in Hong Kong protest outside the Chinese embassy in London on July 1st | Photo credit should read Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwTQ7X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700279/Industry_Response_on_the_Proposed_Amendments_to_Hong_Kongs_Personal_Data_Privacy_Ordinance_and_Request_for_Virtual_Meeting.pdf"&gt;A new letter&lt;/a&gt; from a tech industry group is driving home the risks of Hong Kong’s proposed anti-doxxing rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vatIr"&gt;Sent to Hong Kong’s privacy commissioner for personal data by the Asia Internet Coalition (which counts Google, Apple and Facebook as members), the letter argues that the new measures will have an extreme impact on due process in Hong Kong, and could result in major US tech companies ceasing operations there. The letter was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XKnFM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from... offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O9N5jA"&gt;The letter comes in response to series of amendments to Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO), proposed by the privacy commissioner in response to concerns around online doxxing. Once in effect, the amendments would require swift compliance with any government takedown requests — and ambiguous wording in the text of the bill has spurred concerns that tech employees could be prosecuted as individuals if they do not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGRm8"&gt;“Introducing severe sanctions and especially personal liability in relation to assessing requests for taking down content has the consequence of encouraging online platforms to conduct little to no review of requests and over-block content,” the letter reads. “The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y54dm"&gt;The letter raises new questions about the future of US tech company employees in Hong Kong. The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;estimates that Google, Facebook and Twitter alone keep hundreds of staff in Hong Kong, all of whom could be at risk under the new legislation. Amazon, Apple, Yahoo and Rakuten are also members of the Asia Internet Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfV6Es"&gt;The new amendments come after years of mounting pressure on civil liberties in Hong Kong, as the central Chinese government seeks to exert more influence over the city’s politics. Last year, the passage of a new security law caused Google, Facebook and Twitter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-china"&gt;halt all data production requests&lt;/a&gt; while the law could be reviewed. TikTok (which does not operate in China) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315637/tiktok-hong-kong-security-chinese-government-pompeo-us-ban"&gt;ceased its operations in the city entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q94NCx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kaseya ransomware attackers demand $70 million, claim they infected over a million devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Op7sxnIUyzj7Ay23WQUU0djZeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543356/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1GOXwe"&gt;Three days after ransomware attackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;started the holiday weekend by compromising Kaseya VSA&lt;/a&gt;, we have a clearer idea of how widespread the impact has been. In a new ransom demand, the attackers claim to have compromised more than 1 million computers, and demand $70 million to decrypt the affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjFjTf"&gt;Kaseya’s software is used by Managed Service Providers to perform IT tasks remotely, but on July 2nd, the Russia-linked REvil ransomware group deployed a malicious software update exposing providers who use the platform, and their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6yZ05"&gt;The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) &lt;a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/03/Kaseya-Case-Update/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it appears the exploit used for the breach was same one they discovered and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-was-fixing-zero-day-just-as-revil-ransomware-sprung-their-attack/"&gt;were in the process of addressing&lt;/a&gt; when the attackers struck. “We were already running a broad investigation into backup and system administration tooling and their vulnerabilities,” DIVD wrote. “One of the products we have been investigating is Kaseya VSA. We discovered severe vulnerabilities in Kaseya VSA and reported them to Kaseya, with whom we have been in regular contact since then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UD0tom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We expect the full scope of victim organizations to be higher than what’s being reported by any individual security company.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnViwA"&gt;On Friday, Kaseya CEO Fred Vocolla said that “Only a very small percentage of our customers were affected – currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide.” Sophos VP Ross McKerchar said in a statement Sunday that “This is one of the farthest reaching criminal ransomware attacks that Sophos has ever seen. At this time, our evidence shows that more than 70 managed service providers were impacted, resulting in more than 350 further impacted organizations. We expect the full scope of victim organizations to be higher than what’s being reported by any individual security company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsc44o"&gt;Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger followed up on earlier comments by President Biden, saying “The FBI and CISA will reach out to identified victims to provide assistance based upon an assessment of national risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0QmGR"&gt;Huntress Labs is participating in the response to the attack and has &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident"&gt;cataloged most of the available information&lt;/a&gt;, saying the attack compromised over 1,000 businesses that it’s tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5MmO6y3xvrdunOgsQPSuQKjfbow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700229/revil_blog.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sophos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;REvil ransom demand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0baZ3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kaseya’s SaaS cloud servers remain offline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rHGJX"&gt;Sophos, Huntress and others pointed to this post (above) on REvil’s “Happy Blog,” claiming that more than a million devices have been infected and setting a ransom demand of $70 million in Bitcoin to unlock all of them. REvil has been linked to a slew of ransomware incidents, including one attack involving Kaseya in &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-hacks-msps-to-deploy-ransomware-on-customer-systems/"&gt;June 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and a high-profile incident earlier this year targeting the meat supplier JBS. However, security researcher Marcus Hutchins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1412139752434782209"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about the group’s claim, suggesting they’re overstating the impact in hopes of extracting a large payout from Kaseya or someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HiljG"&gt;So far, once of the companies most noticeably impacted by the attack is Coop, a line of over 800 grocery stores in Sweden that closed Saturday as the attack shut down its cash registers. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/stangda-butiker/"&gt;note on its website&lt;/a&gt;, stores where customers can shop using Coop’s Scan &amp;amp; Pay mobile app have reopened, while other locations remain closed. Experts have predicted that on Tuesday when workers return to offices in the US, there may be more victims discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCMHig"&gt;Three days after the attack, Kaseya’s SaaS cloud servers remain offline. The &lt;a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; it will provide an updated timeline for server restoration this evening, as well as more technical details of the attack to help recovery efforts by customers and security researchers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 is on sale — and it’s an even better deal at $649</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XoJzbpw0mSnKeUGflvNB8t8miA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543226/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0070_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 misses some of the high-end features on the more expensive Pro model, but it’s a better overall buy for most people.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8wNGQ"&gt;The OnePlus’ latest flagship phones are marked down at several retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/05/grab-a-oneplus-9-for-the-price-it-probably-shouldve-been-at-launch/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;normally $729 OnePlus 9 down to $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro (usually $1069) to $969&lt;/a&gt;. We think that the more basic 9 is already the better buy than the 9 Pro for most people, and the extra $80 off the retail price makes it an even sweeter deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwH0B6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up surprisingly few features&lt;/a&gt; compared to its more expensive sibling — you still get a Snapdragon 888 processor, display with 120Hz refresh rate, and an excellent 50-megapixel ultrawide camera. You’ll have to make do with an unstabilized main camera, plastic rather than aluminum frame, and slower wireless charging. Considering that you save more than $300 off the price of the premium model, these downgrades feel like things most of us could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f9yVX6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0zv63j"&gt;A word of caution if you’re ready to add the OnePlus 9 to your virtual cart: while it’s fully compatible with Verizon and T-Mobile 4G and 5G networks, it’s 4G only on AT&amp;amp;T. That’s not a big deal now (actually, you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;probably better off sticking with its 4G&lt;/a&gt; at the moment). However, AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network should improve over the next couple of years as the company starts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;employing its new C-band frequencies&lt;/a&gt;, which the 9 and 9 Pro support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rimac takes over Bugatti from VW in powerhouse electric supercar deal</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRkwgd"&gt;Croatian electric supercar startup Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/media/press-releases/rimac-and-bugatti-combine-forces-in-historic-new-venture/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was taking over Bugatti from Volkswagen to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56be5f08-fe6e-481f-ba6d-71ef49d2cfc4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk90BC"&gt;Bugatti Rimac will be led by Mate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 in a garage as a one-man operation. Over that period, Rimac has become a highly desirable brand, with many legacy automakers calling upon the startup to help build their own electric supercars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR13b2"&gt;It’s not much of a question why that is. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463499/rimac-nevera-production-c-two-concept-hypercar"&gt;Rimac released the Nevera&lt;/a&gt;, a quad-motor, 1,914 horsepower demonstration of electric absurdity, with a top speed of 258mph and an ability to leap to zero to 60mph in less than 2 seconds. The Nevera is expected to be the fastest sports car ever made, a title previously held by the Bugatti Chiron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9KFswX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIVCx8"&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti, the 112-year-old French brand known for its aggressively priced supercars like the Chiron and Veyron. VW’s Porsche brand will own the remaining shares in Bugatti. (Even though Porsche owns some stock in Rimac, it’s total ownership will not give it a controlling interest in Bugatti, the companies told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7FPN"&gt;Volkswagen has owned Bugatti since 1998, when it bought the sports car brand for $50 million after acquiring Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini. This was an all-stock deal, meaning no money changed hands, according to Porsche boss Oliver Blume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSlOar"&gt;Rimac Group will own both Bugatti Rimac and Rimac Technologies, an offshoot of the company focused on the development, production and supply of battery systems, drivetrains and other EV components. Over the years, Rimac has supplied automotive components to Porsche, Hyundai, and, yes, Bugatti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tImhT"&gt;“Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,” Rimac says. “Bugatti Rimac represents the company that will develop the future of both Bugatti and Rimac vehicles, by joining resources and expertise in research and development, production, and other areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFK5ey"&gt;Both companies will retain their respective headquarters, but Rimac plans to eventually merge its workforce at the planned $200 million campus in Croatia, which is set to open in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpfS1O"&gt;“This is a truly exciting moment in the short, yet rapidly expanding history of Rimac Automobili,” Mate Rimac said in a statement. “We have gone through so much in such a short space of time, but this new venture takes things to a completely new level. Rimac and Bugatti are a perfect match in terms of what we each bring to the table. As a young, agile and fast-paced automotive and technology company, we have established ourselves as an industry pioneer in electric technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbNasi"&gt;Rimac said Bugatti would have an electric model this decade but would still produce hybrid models by the end of that period. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb has blocked tens of thousands of partiers in COVID crackdown</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6q7aFD"&gt;Airbnb has blocked or redirected “potentially risky reservation attempts” from over 50,000 people across 15 US cities as part of a crackdown on parties in its properties during the pandemic. These include 7,000 in Dallas, 6,000 in San Diego, 5,100 in Charlotte, 3,500 in St. Louis, 3,000 in Columbus, and 2,700 in New Orleans, the company’s head of trust and safety communication Ben Breit tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFwQE4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/04/airbnb-blocks-young-adults-from-renting-denver-party-homes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s blocked 5,000 people from making bookings in Phoenix, 4,500 in Las Vegas, 4,500 in Seattle, 2,600 in Denver, 2,600 in Portland, 1,800 in Salt Lake City, and 1,500 in Albuquerque. “In the past year, this technology has blocked or redirected potentially risky reservation attempts from more than 2,000 people in Cincinnati,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/airbnb-says-efforts-to-crack-down-on-parties-are-working-in-cincinnati/36869789"&gt;company told &lt;em&gt;WLWT5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while 3,800 were blocked in Austin, &lt;a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/party-crash-airbnb-blocked-3800-risky-reservations-in-austin-area-over-last-year/"&gt;according to KXAN&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of blocked bookings may be higher, Airbnb says, since each of these blocked individuals may have attempted to make more than one booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpWmku"&gt;The numbers show the scale of Airbnb’s enforcement action, and follows a total global ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-global-party-ban/"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; to prevent its rental properties becoming an alternative to local bars and clubs forced to close due to the pandemic. “Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,” the company said at the time. The ban was an expansion of existing rules prohibiting dedicated “party houses,” which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1190675126594879489"&gt;came into force in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WkT9Iu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MIxYXH"&gt;Breit outlined to &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; which kinds of bookings its system has been automatically blocking in the US &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/strengthening-our-safety-commitment-to-u-s-hosts-and-communities/"&gt;since July last year&lt;/a&gt;. “If you are under the age of 25 and you don’t have a history of positive reviews, we will not allow you to book an entire home listing local to where you live,” Breit said. However, other bookings which make less sense for party locations would still be allowed. Trying to rent in a distant city is ok, for example, as is renting a smaller location more locally. Airbnb is now using this particular system across the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASKpT5"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/#:~:text=we%20believe%20it%20worked.%20those%20weekends%20were%20quiet%2C%20and%20these%20initiatives%20were%20well-received%20by%20our%20host%20community."&gt;believes its ban has worked&lt;/a&gt;, and said that major events like Halloween and New Year’s Eve were “quiet” as a result. In Denver specifically, &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post &lt;/em&gt;reports that complaints about short-term rental properties halved between January and May this year compared to the same period in 2020, though it’s unclear how much of this can be attributed to Airbnb’s policies versus a more general decline due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNvlSx"&gt;Although vaccines are continuing to roll out across the world, Airbnb is showing no signs of relaxing its rules, and recently said it would be extending its ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-extension-of-party-ban-through-end-of-summer/"&gt;through to the end of summer 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It explained why as part of its “summer of responsible travel” &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;announcement in April&lt;/a&gt; when it cited warnings from public health experts about the continued risks of mass gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLDs5n"&gt;The automatic blocking of suspected party bookings is just one part of the company’s crackdown. Other elements include providing discounted noise detection devices to hosts and a 24/7 neighborhood support line in the US, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCYjBV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 6th, 3:49AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Airbnb has clarified that the initial figures listed as bookings were actually the number of people who’ve been blocked from making bookings, where one person might make multiple booking attempts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu9rtW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
