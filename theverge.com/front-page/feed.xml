    <title>Spotify becomes latest to experiment with a TikTok-style video feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sh9gHQzThFhi1M64NMuS2rqRqKY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70191533/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUxuHi"&gt;Spotify is testing a new TikTok-style video feed in its beta iOS app that shows fullscreen video clips as songs are played, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was first spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472"&gt;Chris Messina&lt;/a&gt;, who posted a video of the feed in action. When available, the video feed is accessible from a new fourth tab in the navigation bar labelled “Discover.” Individual tracks can then be liked as you scroll through the feed, and there’s also a three dot menu icon to bring up options for each song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goODdV"&gt;Spotify confirmed the test in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, but declined to comment on if or when it might see a wider rollout. “At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,” a spokesperson said. “Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have any further news to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="92MwXs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not only that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Spotify&lt;/a&gt; Discover is basically a pared down version of a TikTok-style feed of vertical music videos (likely using their canvas format) that you can like or skip.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewSpotify?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NewSpotify&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hpOEZ8v9bl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hpOEZ8v9bl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Messina.eth (@chrismessina) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4OmX4a"&gt;The test comes as Netflix has started testing a similar interface in its iOS app to help users discover new content to watch. It’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771727/netflix-kids-clips-tiktok-feed-fast-laughs-ios-app"&gt;“Kids Clips” feature&lt;/a&gt; shows content from its child-friendly shows, and follows the launch of a similar “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311418/netflix-tiktok-clips-funny-movies-tv-shows-streaming-big-mouth-seinfeld"&gt;Fast Laughs&lt;/a&gt;” feed earlier this year. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660516/tiktok-average-watch-time-youtube-us-android-app-annie"&gt;TikTok’s engagement hours soar&lt;/a&gt;, even non-social media platforms are becoming interested in using its format to help users engage with their own services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcZ8kb"&gt;The Discover feed appears to build upon Spotify’s existing Canvas feature, where artists can have videos play alongside their music on the service. The videos shown as part of the Discover feed appear to be the same as those used for Canvas, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UhyQL"&gt;In an interesting sign of how formats are changing, the discovery of Spotify’s new test comes almost a year to the day after the service was experimenting with using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726183/spotify-stories-playlist-snapchat-instagram-christmas-hits"&gt;Snapchat-style stories feature&lt;/a&gt; alongside several of its playlists. Who knows what will be in fashion by this time next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQzUNS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest settles lawsuit that alleged racial and gender discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vz-xO3DuXo9YoHInudSL3Jkf4_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190928/acastro_200902_1777_pinterest_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ZBY8M"&gt;Pinterest has settled a lawsuit brought against it by shareholders who claimed that the company’s workplace discrimination against women and racial minorities hurt its reputation, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/pinterest-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-workplace-culture-rcna6519"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly agreed to spend $50 million on improving its diversity and equity, and will let former employees talk about racial or gender discrimination they experienced, even if they were bound by a non-disclosure agreement. Other financial details of the settlement weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOHYj9"&gt;The lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;filed against the company’s executives in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with shareholder claiming that the company was acting irresponsibly by doing nothing to address “widespread claims of race and gender discrimination.” The complaint also accused the company’s CEO of “surrounding himself with yes-men and marginalizing women who dared to challenge Pinterest’s White, male leadership clique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHDNKy"&gt;That year, multiple women reported that Pinterest paid them less than male employees, and some reported racial discrimination and retaliation for speaking out. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;also reported on discrimination&lt;/a&gt; within the company’s finance team. Separately, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;paid out $20 million to its former COO&lt;/a&gt; Françoise Brougher after she alleged that the company paid her less than male colleagues, didn’t invite her to important meetings, and fired her after she brought up the issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oae8ab"&gt;Brougher’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;noted at the time&lt;/a&gt; that settlements can help companies avoid real accountability, even though they may result in larger payouts and charitable donations. (Pinterest and Brougher agreed to jointly donate over $2 million to charities supporting women and minorities in tech.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably have better options than the candy bar-shaped monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6vfRqCzrSJHbCep1_pvZVcVHrU=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190693/0479960021309_2_l.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Elsonic, via Nojima Online&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B83hkB"&gt;Another day, another interesting gadget &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/ultra-tall-732-monitor-is-ready-for-your-never-ending-newsfeed/"&gt;making the rounds on the internet&lt;/a&gt; — this one is a very tall (aspect ratio-wise anyway) portable monitor with an 8.8-inch display running at a resolution of 420 by 1920. It’s called &lt;a href="https://online.nojima.co.jp/commodity/1/0479960021309/"&gt;the Elsonic EK-MD088&lt;/a&gt;, and while its size, shape, and built-in stand make it intriguing, it also raises the question: what would you even use such a narrow monitor for? And are there better ways to spend your 14,800 yen (around $130 US dollars)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoJxvx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-tall-vertical-monitor-is-perfect-for-doomscrollin-1848116439"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; the most obvious use case for such a tall screen: it seems tailor-made for endlessly scrolling through Twitter or Instagram, keeping the gloom of the internet ever-present off to the side of your work. Honestly, that seems like a great way to destroy your brain — when I first saw it, I immediately thought that it’d be good for keeping chat apps like Telegram and iMessage open on the side, so I could keep an eye on what friends and family were up to throughout the day. You could also use it as a dashboard to monitor your IoT devices, or for more whimsical uses — like getting the full &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat"&gt;longcat&lt;/a&gt; experience without scrolling, or seeing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;the Tall Tweets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C0nx58"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New twitter crop dropped, it's Dinopost time &lt;a href="https://t.co/bbRL6VMhNU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bbRL6VMhNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1390035095302467584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9d35zU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: the type of content this screen was made for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAovnp"&gt;There are some notable quirks to the Elsonic though. For one, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/ultra-tall-732-monitor-is-ready-for-your-never-ending-newsfeed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that it doesn’t seem like it’ll be easily available outside of Japan (and even there it’s not shipping until February 2022). Even worse, though, is that it uses USB-C for power... but not video. Instead, the monitor has a relatively obscure Mini-HDMI port to handle inputs, which is a pretty big downside for convenience. If you forget your display cable somewhere, you’re probably not going to run into someone who can loan you a full-size HDMI to Mini-HDMI cable. It also doesn’t seem to have a built-in battery, so while the screen and clever built-in stand fold up to a compact size, you’d lose some of those space savings to the battery bank you’d want to bring along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aX9_YJwa7kfAlMwf_dmdexHNmeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041878/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_15.28.08.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Absolutely heartbreaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LtIqzj"&gt;The Elsonic is also just, and I know this sounds silly, very narrow. While that’s fine for newsfeeds and timelines, it’d be rough for general use — common second-monitor apps like Slack can get pretty wonky at 420 pixels wide, or may even refuse to go that narrow. While the product page does say you can use it horizontally as well, which would fix the app width issue, 420 pixels is barely any vertical height; you’d be able to see maybe three tweets or messages when factoring in the task bar and window chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjm2GE"&gt;Also, one of the marketing images shows someone editing code on it. That seems absolutely unbearable unless you can &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/j1hk3w/the_most_efficient_possible_use_of_a_3_monitor/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;somehow write your functions in 50 characters or less&lt;/a&gt;. Visual Studio Code will let you resize a window small enough to fit on the Elsonic (unlike my code editor of choice, Nova), but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1opsN1g58DYBBB2LVK10VBAisD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041424/0479960021309_2_l.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elsonic, via Nojima Online&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This seems... unrealistic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xYvxriqj83N62U-hBqnh0hbMuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041557/2021_11_24_13_41_16___Untitled_2___ebayMarketAnalyzer_master___Visual_Studio_Code.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: what your window would look like if it were actually running at 420 by 960.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1pl7Ao"&gt;While it’s easy to see the appeal of having a vertical screen that you can carry around with you, you almost certainly have better options. For desk use, many regular 16:9 and 16:10 computer monitors have stands that already let you orient them vertically, which will give you even more screen real estate. This &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-24GN650-B-Ultragear-FreeSync-Adjustable/dp/B08V85XBFZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG monitor that’s currently on sale&lt;/a&gt; is about $50 more than the Elsonic, but it’s also 24-inches instead of 8.8 and could act as a decent low-cost gaming monitor in landscape with its 144Hz refresh rate. You could also likely get a monitor that could be turned on its side for much cheaper than the EK-MD088’s asking price by shopping locally for used, office-focused Dells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyqFmR"&gt;If bigger isn’t better for your use-case, or you’re looking for a portable solution, you could always pick up a used iPad. Apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20894680/duet-secondary-display-android-price-date"&gt;Duet Display&lt;/a&gt; let you use the tablet as a second monitor for a Windows or Mac PC through a single cable (or even wirelessly using Duet Air or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903787/apple-macos-catalina-sidecar-macbook-air-pro-butterfly-keys-ipad"&gt;macOS’ built-in Sidecar utility&lt;/a&gt;), and can even support vertical orientation. Pair an iPad Mini with a stand and you’ve got a slightly shorter, but wider version of the Elsonic. And, of course, it’ll also be a tablet when you’re done using it as a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Z1p5fu-WY1U2k4NHGgGMKr9Exo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041860/0479960021309_6_l.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elsonic via Nojima Online&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aNXgHpM93-E-x7A9GaFG5TJPrfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23041775/IMG_3217.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61ILi5"&gt;While those solutions may be more practical for most use cases, I’ll admit they don’t have the fun factor that the tall boi does, and that there are niche use cases where the Elsonic makes more sense. And hey, maybe I’m totally wrong on this, and we’ll all have dedicated screens for Twitter by this time next year — though that thought is almost too horrific to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battle.net has recovered from DDoS attack, Blizzard says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Battle.net" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/424L91bpsjHidtMAWLXUsW4SLlc=/71x0:830x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190455/battlenetlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWXEbY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1463665481177571332"&gt;Blizzard says&lt;/a&gt; that the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that were overwhelming its servers with coordinated traffic are over, and that you should be able to log into Battle.net again. During the almost hour-long Wednesday evening attack, you may have experienced serious issues trying to get onto the online service underpinning &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;’s online features and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38wBVF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The DDOS attacks that we were monitoring have ended. If you are still unable to log in try &lt;a href="https://t.co/XSV7UVlWlu"&gt;https://t.co/XSV7UVlWlu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blizzard CS - The Americas (@BlizzardCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1463665481177571332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqpif4"&gt;Blizzard stated that the issue was caused by a DDoS on its verified customer service Twitter account, and additionally in a “Breaking News” item you may have seen in the PC Battle.net client if you tried to sign on during the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pcECfz"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ilRbrl"&gt;On DownDetector, outage reports spiked across a number of Activision Blizzard properties, with thousands reporting that Battle.net was down, but only hundreds complaining about individual Blizzard games losing service. We didn’t see the typical number of reports that crop up on Twitter when a game goes down, either, so it seems clear it wasn’t a full outage, and that the “high latency and disconnections” likely didn’t affect the majority of players. The outage reports seem to have more or less returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle.net, Diablo, and Call of Duty’s outage reports spiked, but have now dropped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>The new pro football NFT marketplace has a name: NFL All Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joshua Bessex/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjap9m"&gt;It has been less than a year since NBA Top Shot served as an introduction for many sports fans into the world of NFTs, and now the NFL is lining up a similar arrangement. In September, the league &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-nflpa-and-dapper-labs-announce-new-nft-deal-to-create-exclusive-digital-vide"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with the company that runs Top Shot, Dapper Labs, and now we know the name of the service that will distribute the video highlight clips that make up the “Moments” that become NFTs: NFL All Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KtwLOm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can the NBA make NFTs cool?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5UryIF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MLFDr"&gt;This effort is separate from the Ticketmaster-powered NFTs that the NFL is tying to selected games this season (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789265/nft-nfl-football-commerative-ticketmaster"&gt;the Lions’ annual Thanksgiving appearance on national TV&lt;/a&gt;), but launching the branding now doesn’t feel like a coincidence. There will be many blockchain and NFT discussions amongst family members on Thursday, between these NFL promotions and even the Macy’s parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hg6LW5"&gt;NFL All Day will use the Dapper Labs Flow blockchain just like Top Shot, with the trading and showcasing of Moments happening on the All Day platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UphQ2v"&gt;NFL All Day isn’t ready to launch yet, but &lt;a href="https://nfl.dapperlabs.com/"&gt;the website hosting its waitlist has been updated&lt;/a&gt;, promising visitors that they can experience “the future of fandom” via digital video collectibles. From what we can see in a thread posted on Twitter, it appears things will be very similar to NBA Top Shot. You can buy randomized packs of Moments, with each one assigned some level of rarity. They’re also advertising “Melts” that combine more than one play into a Moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="56F3hU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;    ALL DAY! &lt;a href="https://t.co/UJP1Of3DIu"&gt;https://t.co/UJP1Of3DIu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes/status/1463524580060848140?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9MYwMn"&gt;The explosive initial popularity of Top Shot suggests the possibility there is an audience for this among the hundreds of millions of NFL fans. Until more features launch, however, it’s unclear exactly what they’ll do with these collectibles once they have them or if the marketplace can maintain popularity as it grows to accommodate more users who all anticipate uncovering rare finds in their packs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost buying a copy of the Constitution is easy, but giving the money back is hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eLo8BE5M_FA0IJGJi47jvLYoGM=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70190316/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ps4ajp"&gt;As of last Thursday night, ConstitutionDAO found itself in possession of around $49.8 million it wasn’t able to spend. The group’s organizers only had a mandate to spend the crowdfunded money on one thing — a rare copy of the US Constitution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;that they failed to win at auction&lt;/a&gt; — so instead of trying to get community approval to use the money toward some other goal, they instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799192/constitutiondao-shutting-down-lost-auction-refunds"&gt;began the process of returning the funds to backers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUdMUT"&gt;Returning that much money has been a tricky process, though. Backers have to manually request refunds, so even a week later, tens of millions of dollars are still sitting in ConstitutionDAO’s pockets. And because all of the money was collected in Ether, and sending funds over Ethereum incurs high transaction costs, getting money back has become an expensive proposition for contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7VSzF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are new to this; it’s difficult to understand.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="usBGaI"&gt;The return process has not been as messy as its worst moments have let on — at least not yet. More than half of the funds ConstitutionDAO collected have since been returned, according to &lt;a href="https://dune.xyz/ilemi/ConstitutionDAO-Funding-Tracker"&gt;figures pulled by Andrew Hong&lt;/a&gt;, a data scientist working in the crypto space. Close to $27 million, or about 54 percent of the total raised, has been sent back as of this afternoon. But that also means there’s still close to $23 million sitting around waiting to be returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEboNg"&gt;ConstitutionDAO said there’s no time limit on contributors getting their money back. Because the returns need to be requested manually, though, the soon-to-be-dissolved organization could theoretically be sitting on a large and otherwise-unusable refund pile for some time to come if backers don’t know or care to get their money out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2URYg"&gt;The ConstitutionDAO team has discussed creating educational resources on how to get refunds, says Jonah Erlich, a core contributor to ConstitutionDAO who made a guide on how to donate money. “People are new to this; it’s difficult to understand,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not the ideal situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SciokQ"&gt;The other issue has been transaction fees. All the contributions were made over Ethereum, and Ethereum requires fees — often steep ones — to transmit currency (along with performing many other tasks). That was already a hurdle when it came to raising funds to buy the Constitution. These fees, known as gas, don’t meaningfully shrink when someone is sending a small amount of Ether, so small-dollar donors often had to pay large sums just to send their contribution in the first place, according to Alex Kroeger, an engineer in the crypto space. To send around $170 worth of Ether to the project, he had to spend around $50 in fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Soiw5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The median contribution was $217, most of which could be eaten by fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBes7h"&gt;More than $1 million was spent on gas fees in total to make contributions to ConstitutionDAO, according to &lt;a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/260439"&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/260336"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt; by Kroeger and, &lt;a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/252602"&gt;separately,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/260218"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; Richard Chen, a general partner at the cryptocurrency investment firm 1confirmation. Erlich also estimated the gas fees for contributions were around $800,000 to $1 million. The Ethereum system ConstitutionDAO relied on “is not optimal for small value use cases at the moment,” Kroeger told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqc4NS"&gt;Anyone who wants their money back now has to pay gas fees &lt;em&gt;again &lt;/em&gt;on the refund, and already more than $200,000 has been spent on that in total, according to Kroeger and Chen. The fees may not be an issue for large donors — if you’re getting $100,000 back, $50 is a small sum to pay — but that’s not the case for most of ConstitutionDAO’s contributors. The median contributor sent $217. If that person were to spend $50 to send the money and another $50 to get it back, they’d have lost nearly half of their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0ioh6"&gt;And that estimate may be conservative. One contributor tweeted that they paid $70 in gas to send $200, then spent another $70 to get the money back. That means they’re out $140 on what should have been a $200 refund. For anyone who sent &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;than the current gas price, getting a refund simply won’t be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EblWzc"&gt;That’s part of what’s made this situation so complicated. Many contributors had hoped that ConstitutionDAO would pivot its focus and direct its enormous account balance toward another purpose. Organizers briefly floated launching a new token for those interested in reorganizing around a different goal, then reversed course and ultimately announced plans to shut down. It was a disappointment to many in the group’s Discord channel, where contributors were supposed to be able to influence the group’s decision-making. But the organization never actually achieved its goal of becoming a true DAO — a decentralized autonomous organization, which would have been member-controlled — and organizers made the decision themselves to shutter and focus on refunds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYDzLo"&gt;The outcome shows both the promise and challenges of DAOs and other crypto-oriented groups. ConstitutionDAO was able to raise an impressive sum of money very quickly in the span of a week. But steep fees (to say nothing of the challenges of setting up and buying into the Ethereum ecosystem) made the project hard for small donors to contribute to, and the organization’s decision to dissolve showed that, despite all the promises around decentralization, there’s often still a core group in control at the top. And in the end, it’s those who contributed the least who will most get burned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 5:33PM ET, November 24th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Amazon now has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;an actual price cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on the 128GB model, dropping from $299.99 to $249.99. Not only can you currently get this price, but entering OCULUS50 at checkout will earn you a $50 Amazon credit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1DtN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2XJSUmC5J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2-standalone%2Fp%2FN82E16826910033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/oculus-quest-2-all-in-one-vr-headset---256-gb-with-quest-2-carrying-case.product.100797536.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Foculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F508466743&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a similar deal&lt;/a&gt;, though in lieu of a gift card, it’s including the zip-up case as a complementary goodie without changing the $299.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8axuK"&gt;Amazon gets a special mention for its deal, which includes the 128GB headset for $50 off, along with a $50 Amazon credit. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Head to this link&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;strong&gt;OCULUS50 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to get in on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKJoid"&gt;This gift card promo happening at several retailers extends to the $399.99 headset that doubles the storage to 256GB, which includes a $50 gift card as well. Just note that you’ll earn a gift card to the retailer where you purchased the Oculus Quest 2, unless you buy it from Oculus directly. In that case, you’ll get $50 of credit to use on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;games purchased digitally&lt;/a&gt; through the Oculus Store. If you’re a fan of creepy first-person shooters, I highly suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ux7Typ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyqXUu"&gt;You’re welcome to use your gift card however you like, but if you’re open to suggestions, I’d use it on either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ tough, zip-up case for the headset&lt;/a&gt; and its controllers, or its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap that makes the Quest 2 much more comfortable to wear&lt;/a&gt;. Each cost $50, so choose wisely (or get both, knowing that you’re spending only half as much as you would have normally to kit out your new headset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dYvgvJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some game recommendations for Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"},{"title":"Resident Evil 4 VR review: it shouldn’t work this well, but it does","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review"},{"title":"Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account?

    <title>Black Friday 2021 smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzBxpdIVD7rM7z674DaQ5xUPd_E=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178330/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 8 is one of many smart speakers and displays on sale this smart home buying season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop.

&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NR9KWv"&gt;Smart security camera and security system deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eZyOKA"&gt;The cheapest Ring video doorbell, Ring Video Doorbell Wired, gets even cheaper with an $18 price cut to $41.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Wired/dp/B08CKHPP52?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ring Wired uses existing doorbell wiring and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Ijz8w"&gt;The tiny Blink Mini camera is selling for an even tinier price. Just $20 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, down from $34.99, this is the cheapest indoor smart security camera you can buy right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QsMbFF"&gt;For outside surveillance, Google’s very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Cam with floodlight&lt;/a&gt; is $50 off ($229.99 instead of $279.99), and this deal can be found at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r1JbYWRz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XQjdTT"&gt;Speaking of Google, the older, hardwired Nest Doorbell is $80 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Wired/381881630?athbdg=L1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L6cm1smu?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired/-/A-52629447#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $149. This is still one of the best smart doorbells, despite its age. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A new model is coming in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a great price on a long-standing product from Google.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ plan to boost ‘tree equity’ is actually a good idea </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gold shovels surround tree to be planted at Joyce Kilmer..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Hggj7vP0JtJ9A2cYC48Y1V0RhI=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189736/498219190.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;THE BRONX, NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2015/11/20: Gold shovels surround tree to be planted at Joyce Kilmer Park.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Andy Katz/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilMjE4"&gt;Trees have become a contentious piece of Democrats’ Build Back Better Act, the budget reconciliation bill that encompasses sweeping social and environmental programs. Congressional Republicans have seized on the $3 billion in the proposed nearly $2 trillion bill earmarked for planting trees, with a focus on boosting ‘tree equity’ — despite the fact that this is a strategy that experts say could reduce health disparities in cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sUyYU"&gt;While opponents have called the tree equity provisions an indicator of Democrats’ “reckless spending &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepBalderson/status/1455180262082596866"&gt;spree&lt;/a&gt;” and a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepFrenchHill/status/1455255972700729349"&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt; [of] even more taxpayer dollars,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in reality, disparities in tree coverage across American cities are a huge problem that affects heat exposure, air quality and more, with serious consequences on people’s health. This inequity actually builds on a legacy of segregating, polluting, and disinvesting in communities of color. Planting trees in the right places could be one step towards healing some of those injustices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rrv8g1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re depriving communities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz547H"&gt;“We’re depriving communities that need and depend on those trees to help them live a good quality of life,” says Charity Nyelele, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyNrsN"&gt;Neighborhoods where a majority of residents are people of color have, on average, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/29/trees-america-cities-study-disparities"&gt;33 percent less tree canopy cover&lt;/a&gt; than majority white neighborhoods, according to data from the Tree Equity Score, an initiative backed by the nonprofit American Forests. Americans of color are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/2013/07/minorities-more-likely-to-live-in-urban-heat-islands-study-finds#:~:text=Comparing%20satellite%20images%20and%20Census,at%20risk%20during%20heat%20waves.&amp;amp;text=Another%20story%20on%20this%20topic%20appeared%20in%20Popular%20Science."&gt;live in ‘urban heat islands,’&lt;/a&gt; places that trap heat because there’s a lot more concrete and asphalt than trees and greenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63dNIP"&gt;That’s no accident. Urban heat islands also overlap with maps of &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/extreme-heat-redlining-portland/"&gt;redlined&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods, places where Black Americans were pushed to move into since the 1930s because of discriminatory housing policies that denied them home loans and insurance. Now, these neighborhoods reach temperatures up to 7 degrees Celsius hotter than nearby non-redlined neighborhoods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDZXKl"&gt;One solution to cool down urban heat islands is to plant more trees. Trees not only provide shade, they also dial down temperatures when water evaporates from their leaves (a cooling &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; called evapotranspiration that’s similar to humans sweating). One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161886671400106X"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix found that trees were even more effective at helping neighborhoods chill out during the daytime than other heat mitigation strategies, like painting roofs and streets white to reflect the sun’s radiation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yE8Nwf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A life-saving service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wXX5i0"&gt;That is a life-saving service. Extreme heat has killed more people than any other weather-related disaster in the US over the past &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;thirty years&lt;/a&gt;. The deaths are often concentrated in the most vulnerable communities. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/heat-check/"&gt;In New York City&lt;/a&gt;, for example, extreme heat has killed a &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/datatable47.pdf"&gt;disproportionately high number&lt;/a&gt; of Black residents. Heat waves are only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;becoming more dangerous because of the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ISTTk"&gt;“Most people just think it’s about beautification or aesthetics, just plant trees because they’re pretty and beautiful to look at,” Nyelele says. “But that’s not the case. It’s about the benefits that we can derive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxDruf"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://envirobites.org/2020/08/03/unequal-access-to-urban-tree-benefits-in-the-bronx/"&gt;other benefits&lt;/a&gt; to having more trees in neighborhoods. Trees can actually help clean up air pollution, which is another common problem in neighborhoods without a lot of green space. And they can reduce street flooding because their roots and the soil they grow in absorb water, as opposed to impervious surfaces like asphalt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sq8rVJ"&gt;Funny enough, Republicans have attacked the Build Back Better Act and its tree provisions even though they’ve actually been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300277/republicans-democrats-climate-change-strategies-pew-research"&gt;fan&lt;/a&gt; of tree planting as a strategy to tackle climate change. Last year, former President Trump even &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/one-trillion-trees-world-economic-forum-launches-plan-to-help-nature-and-the-climate/#:~:text=The%20World%20Economic%20Forum%20has%20launched%20a%20global,businesses%20and%20individuals%20in%20a%20%22mass-scale%20nature%20restoration%22."&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; the US to joining an initiative to plant a trillion trees around the world. Although that initiative has garnered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;significant criticism&lt;/a&gt; from scientists, healthy forests are important carbon sinks, because trees trap and store planet-heating carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9qpBq"&gt;“There are also the benefits that you can’t really that you can’t measure,” says Ariane Middel, assistant professor at Arizona State University who focuses on urban climate science. “Just being in nature has benefits, overall for people’s health. And those are really tough to put into numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fW8zJ"&gt;As it now stands, the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376"&gt;Build Back Better Act&lt;/a&gt; includes $3 billion in grants to tribes, state agencies, local governments, and NGOs for tree planting. It prioritizes “projects that increase tree equity,” but details on how the money would be spent are otherwise scarce. There’s another $100 million in the bill for the Forest Service to create new urban forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNubLs"&gt;While it would become the single biggest &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/president-biden-announces-the-build-back-better-framework/"&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; of climate policies in US history if it ultimately passes into law, the bill still faces a tough vote in the divided Senate after months of political wrangling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDmbam"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5V0dMO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Macy’s is auctioning off Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs, including this creepy elf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6R-Z6naYPVymfAref3ysSXMWMs=/0x34:1102x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70189710/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_2.20.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elf is one of 10 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade NFTs up for auction. | Image: Macy’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XPy4T"&gt;Macy’s department stores might be closed this Thanksgiving, but that doesn’t mean the company has run out of things to sell. The retailer is auctioning off &lt;a href="https://www.macys.com/social/macys-parade-nft/"&gt;10 one-of-a-kind NFTs&lt;/a&gt; to mark the 95th year of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqPJUa"&gt;Each NFT references a parade balloon from decades past, going back to a black and white toy soldier from the 1920s. Also featured is an elf character from the 2000s and a spaceman from the 1950s, who &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/despite-predictions-of-the-day-before-that-rain-was-in-news-photo/97328196?adppopup=true"&gt;lost an arm&lt;/a&gt; in the 1955 parade after colliding with a lamppost (the NFT version is fully inflated). Proceeds from the auction benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with current bids generating tens of thousands of dollars. The auction ends on November 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47enlx"&gt;In addition to the 10 unique NFTs, Macy’s is giving away 9,500 other parade-themed pieces of varying rarity on a first-come, first-served basis on Thanksgiving Day. Ten percent of any future sales of any of the pieces will also go to Make-A-Wish. Macy’s is using Polygon to mint the NFTs, touted as a more &lt;a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-the-eco-friendly-blockchain-scaling-ethereum-bbdd52201ad/"&gt;eco-friendly solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7ALORm"&gt;&lt;iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/647560441?h=fb9bf36863" width="640" height="798" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6eJfsn"&gt;The retailer joins a long list of companies hedging bets on NFTs, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;Taco Bell&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pringles/status/1372242606902673409?"&gt;Pringles&lt;/a&gt;. In the FAQ section below Macy’s announcement, the company says it’s releasing NFTs because “we’re always looking to innovate our classic celebrations.” After posting nearly $4 billion in pandemic losses last year on top of already declining sales, it’s perhaps unsurprising the retailer is looking for new ways to show the brand isn’t a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
