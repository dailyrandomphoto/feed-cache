    <title>Corsair K70 RGB TKL mechanical keyboard review: great gaming, good typing  </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great for gamers, good for everyone else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xQzA0F"&gt;Corsair’s K70 RGB TKL is an unashamedly gaming-focused keyboard. For one thing, it’s only available with the kinds of switches people normally recommend for playing games, while other features like low input latency and a dedicated “tournament switch” for esports clearly have gamers in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDVBl0"&gt;At a price of $139.99 (£139.99), these features are coming at a premium, and they’re overkill for anyone not planning on competing at the next &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; International. But the K70 RGB TKL is a complete package with lots of quality-of-life features for non-gamers. It attaches to your PC with a detachable USB-C cable (a first for Corsair) and features customizable per-key RGB backlighting, dedicated media keys, and a roller wheel for volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfzVeU"&gt;At this price, the result is a great gaming-focused keyboard but only a good general purpose keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLZPGv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10484060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2uJL"&gt;In case the specs didn’t tip you off beforehand, just looking at the Corsair K70 RGB TKL should tell you everything you need to know about its target audience. The bold, squared-off font on its keycaps is peak gamer, and the case itself has a minimalist, angular design. The only branding you get is a small Corsair logo on the keyboard’s forehead, which illuminates along with the rest of the keyboard’s lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5snihp"&gt;Its design might not be for everyone, but construction quality is good here. The K70’s keycaps are made of hard-wearing PBT plastic, and their legends are double-shot, meaning they let each switch’s lighting shine through and will never rub off. Corsair uses a standard keyboard layout, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding replacement keycaps in the right sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffc4Uk"&gt;As its name implies, the K70 RGB TKL is a tenkeyless board (hence the “TKL” in its name), meaning you don’t get a numpad to the right of the arrow keys. This makes perfect sense on a gaming keyboard, where you’ll typically spend most of your time with your left hand on the WASD keys and your right hand on a mouse. Unless you really need it for data entry, a numpad just gets in the way. Available layouts include US ANSI, UK ISO (which I’m using), and other European layouts, but there are no Mac-specific keys available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tht1gQjD2DaVNQ5ZkvAqO-VTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491339/jporter_20210430_4567_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A discreet volume roller can be found on the top right of the board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f6NOzpuGTaY9QINlBLXJIxJJQ74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491340/jporter_20210430_4567_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switch options are limited to Cherry’s linear gaming-focused models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6IyL1t"&gt;Although it’s not particularly wide, Corsair’s keyboard has a bit of a forehead to house its media keys and volume roller. I generally prefer this simple approach, rather than having to access media controls through a combination of keypresses, even if it adds a little more bulk to the board. Build quality is otherwise solid; the keyboard wouldn’t flex, no matter how much I tried to bend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB56Z"&gt;The keyboard’s configuration options are aimed squarely at gamers. There’s no option for tactile Cherry MX Browns or clicky Cherry MX Blue switches here. Instead, your options are classic gamer Cherry MX Reds, competitive gamer Cherry MX Speed Silvers, or, if you’re in Korea, considerate gamer Cherry MX Silent Reds. My review board came equipped with standard Red switches. The switches aren’t hot-swappable, so you’re going to have to use desoldering tools and then a soldering iron if you want to try out any other switch types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez5twO"&gt;The nice thing about buying from an established company like Corsair is that its companion software for configuring the keyboard’s layout and lighting effects is slick and polished. iCue is available for Mac and Windows and offers a truly dizzying amount of control over the K70 RGB TKL. You can remap the keyboard’s keys however you like and get access to a plethora of additional lighting effects. The controls are granular and get complicated fast, so I ended up ignoring them and just controlled the keyboard’s lighting from the board itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6P_HFuMqYVaePe1XcyrGQfr6TI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491336/jporter_20210430_4567_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can control its lighting directly from the keyboard itself or via companion software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1SKfhT"&gt;As well as handling lighting controls, iCue can also handle key remapping if you want to swap the layout of your keyboard around. It’s not as necessary a feature on a TKL board as on a smaller board with a more limited selection of keys, but it’s a useful inclusion if you want to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE3QxG"&gt;All of these are useful features regardless of what you want to use the Corsair K70 RGB TKL for. But its more unique features are gaming-focused. First up is a “tournament switch” on the top of the board, which disables any custom macros you’ve set up and switches the backlighting to a single less-distracting color. (You can customize which color using iCue.) It’s the kind of feature I could see being helpful if you’re simultaneously big into online gaming and also use a ton of macros. That’s a pretty slim Venn diagram of users, but thankfully, the switch is completely out of the way otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx3qDD"&gt;The other gaming feature here is an advertised polling rate of 8,000Hz, which is eight times higher than the 1,000Hz rate used by most keyboards. In theory, this means the keyboard’s input lag or the time between you pressing a key and the signal being transmitted to your PC, is as minimal as possible, presumably making all the difference in a high-speed gaming situation. Corsair tells me this brings down median latency to under a quarter of a millisecond, compared to 2 milliseconds and up with a 1,000Hz keyboard. You enable the 8,000Hz polling rate from within Corsair’s software. It’ll warn you that the higher polling rate uses more system resources, but I didn’t notice any impact on performance on my Ryzen 5 3600-equipped gaming PC, and Corsair tells me this should be the same for anyone using a gaming machine built in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GBVjLAWMRGKlRr_J2Ptlir2mv3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491343/jporter_20210430_4567_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The K70’s “tournament switch” and detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCLcIJMximxlaIB00lCJbKhuECg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491341/jporter_20210430_4567_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its keycaps are good quality, but their standard layout means it should be easy to find replacements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="InxyMQ"&gt;We’ve seen a similar trend with gaming mice, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOQNRvJbpmk"&gt;Linus Tech Tips did a great analysis&lt;/a&gt; of what that actually means for performance. But the real-world difference it makes is minor, and I struggled to feel any difference in responsiveness when switching between playing &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; on the Corsair K70 RGB TKL and a regular 1,000Hz Filco office keyboard when playing on a 100Hz monitor. I have no reason to doubt Corsair’s low latency claims, but I think it’s the kind of improvement that only a small number of players will actually be able to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FPMoQ"&gt;The Corsair K70 RGB TKL is being sold by a gaming-oriented brand as a gaming-oriented keyboard with gaming-oriented switches, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that it doesn’t offer the best typing experience. The typing feel just doesn’t match the crispness of a board like the similarly priced Filco Majestouch 2. Instead, bottoming out each keypress feels slightly dulled or softened, and since this keyboard is only available with linear switches, you’re all but guaranteed to bottom out each keypress while you’re typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="B9qP0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10460594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a3ipn4"&gt;I’ll give credit to Corsair for the K70’s spacebar stabilizer (the mechanism installed under the larger keycap to stop it from wobbling). While this can sometimes sound rattly on other keyboards, there’s no such problem here. But if you listen to the typing sample above, you’ll hear that other stabilized keys like Backspace and Enter have more rattle. Ultimately, the overall typing experience on the K70 RGB TKL is only good, never great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXCwzxvXl0fTBQryBGC_WxgvizI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491338/jporter_20210430_4567_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No numpads here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7w5GLy"&gt;At this point, Corsair knows what it’s doing when it comes to mechanical keyboards for gaming. The K70 RGB TKL comes equipped with all of the quality-of-life features that are expected out of a mainstream keyboard at this point: nice durable keycaps, media keys and volume dial, and a detachable USB-C cable. Some of its more gaming-focused features are borderline overkill, but they don’t get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9f9em"&gt;At its core, though, the K70 RGB TKL is a keyboard designed for gamers, and there are better keyboards out there if you’re only an occasional gamer. You can get a better range of switches elsewhere, as well as a more satisfying typing experience overall. That makes the Corsair K70 RGB TKL a great option for a gaming keyboard, but only a good keyboard overall.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Entertainment Space for Android tablets puts videos, games, and books in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUsgdfGxfW_z4j4mrcuaINoPsuQ=/0x83:1987x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240715/entspace1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdFckA"&gt;Google is today announcing a new feature on Android tablets that plays to one of their greatest strengths: media consumption. The simply named “Entertainment Space” will be a new section to the left of the home screen on tablets from Walmart starting this month, and it’ll expand globally to devices from Lenovo, Sharp, and others later in the year. It’s an all-encompassing hub that brings together video (TV shows, movies, and YouTube), games, and books. Entertainment Space is something Google has been building for a couple years, and it’s one of the more significant changes to the Android tablet experience in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JXixY"&gt;“You’ll save time and avoid having to hop between apps to try to figure out what to do, whether it’s to watch, play or read,” Google’s James Bender &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Once you sign in to your subscription apps, Entertainment Space will show you your content in one place and tailored for you. And if you want to share your tablet, everyone in the family can have their own personalized profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EEceH"&gt;The Watch section basically looks like the Google TV experience on Chromecast — but downsized for a tablet screen. There’s a big hero banner at the top, followed by a list of streaming apps installed on your device, and then you get to the recommendations. These actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; sourced from Google TV, so if you’ve got the new Chromecast, rows like “continue watching” should keep in sync. And you’ll see the familiar row of trending content and personalized picks. Hitting play means getting punted over to whatever app a video is from, but Google hopes its recommendations can help you cut through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXXrpq"&gt;Move over to the Games area and you’ll find recommended titles to try, plus a “continue playing” row of games on your device. Google is also trying to do a better job of putting the spotlight on “instant play” games that let you hop right in without waiting for a download. They get their own row in Entertainment Space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKSaOX9w7KfRqbyyFBdXSjKzzs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22492751/Blog_Post_Read_Tab.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zJKNX1"&gt;Last is the Books tab, which lets you quickly get back to whatever you’re currently reading in Google Play Books. Audiobooks are also here, and Google serves up a list of popular books and highlights items on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unUY1m"&gt;As you might be able to tell, there’s nothing particularly revolutionary about Entertainment Space. Google says over the last year it has seen “over 30 percent more people start using Android tablets compared to the prior year,” and the company’s research shows that people increasingly want help with content discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDeGL1"&gt;But there are already some early complications. For one, Samsung — the company that makes the nicest Android tablets on the market — isn’t yet on board with Entertainment Space. That could change in the months ahead; Google and Samsung are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407361/google-messages-samsung-s21-ultra-one-ui-redesign"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt; working closer together on software. But for now, the list of OEM partners is rather small. That’s partially because Entertainment Space is integrated right into the launcher; it’s not a standalone app you install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sfZTj"&gt;The other issue is that Netflix isn’t taking part in Entertainment Space. It’ll show up in the “recently used” apps row, but Netflix’s content won’t be part of the recommendations in the Watch section. This isn’t all that surprising considering that Netflix has also backed away from Google TV and generally doesn’t seem to like having its shows aggregated and mixed in alongside other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU00M4"&gt;To take part in Entertainment Space, companies can go about it in one of two ways. They can do the work to add their streaming app to Google TV, or make smaller changes with new code coming to the Android developer portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47t42u"&gt;If you have no interest in Entertainment Space, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to turn it off. Hardware OEMs get to decide whether customers can disable the feature entirely. Google controls all content recommendations, but since OEMs can preload apps on devices, that could impact which videos get prominence until you go in and customize your services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSWUys"&gt;Google views Entertainment Space as similar in concept to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21406896/google-kids-space-lenovo-android-tablets-parental-controls"&gt;Kids Space&lt;/a&gt;, a portal that contains age-appropriate features and content for children. But this one is for older members of the family. Such a renewed focus on tablet software from Google is interesting — especially after the Pixel Slate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18693399/google-abandoning-tablets-pixel-slate-failure"&gt;crashed and burned so badly&lt;/a&gt; that it convinced the company to quit making tablet hardware altogether. But the devices are proving to be essential for some during this prolonged work-from-home and remote education period, and with Entertainment Space, Google wants to help make the leisure side a little simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil Village has more guns but fewer scares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOiyAM4zNMB9KVB6iJoqSzYV01M=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240475/RE_Village_Apr_2021_Screens_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;4+7=?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CwmYZM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; has been in a pretty good place of late. After reaching its possible creative nadir with &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; represented a welcome return to the series’ horror roots while reinventing itself with a first-person perspective. Since then, Capcom has put out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;a phenomenally good remake of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"&gt;a solid if less substantial take on its successor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDORT1"&gt;Now we have &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, which comes with a logo styled in a way to let you know that this is really &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 8&lt;/em&gt;, even if Capcom isn’t explicitly naming it as such. It’s a direct sequel to &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;, with the same first-person perspective and bland protagonist Ethan Winters. But while &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt; evoked the slow-burning housebound horror of the original game, &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; is more like a first-person take on arguably the series’ highest point: &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05yTDH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; picks up a few years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;. Ethan and his wife Mia have moved to Europe and are raising their baby, but things quickly go south following an intervention from series icon Chris Redfield. Ethan finds himself in a hostile village populated by savage werewolf-adjacent people and sets out to find his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu5kmT"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; shares a camera angle and basic controls with &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;, the tone is notably different right from the start. Instead of tentatively exploring a creepy, atmospheric environment that gradually reveals the horror within, you’re thrown right into the thick of the action and are left to fend for yourself against warped antagonists — which, you may remember, is exactly how &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; started out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil Village" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfgNsBXL4Y8wi4FciTPN4hmn_Yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493142/RE_Village_Apr_2021_Screens_13.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LlNXl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s similarities to &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; go further than its breakneck opening and rural European setting. It’s a much more action-oriented game than &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll often find yourself taking on several enemies at once. Capcom has also made a lot of quality-of-life tweaks that give the game a breezier feel, from a shortcut that lets you break boxes without equipping your knife to an overhauled inventory system that separates crafting materials from everything else, giving you more space and firepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ErtqZR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10483982"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fyvtQc"&gt;I found &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s shift in tone a little surprising after the broad success of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;. That game was widely lauded for its relatively grounded return to survival horror — at least, about as grounded as you can get when you’re making a game involving horrifically mutated monsters caused by shadowy bioweapon experiments. The setting — mostly centered on a disgusting, fetid house in a Louisiana bayou — was evocative and terrifying, marking the first time in a while that a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game would genuinely make you fear what might be around the next corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M18Z7D"&gt;Save for a couple of notable sequences, &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; mostly throws that idea away. The village itself is a fairly open space that you explore in the daytime, solving environmental puzzles in order to unlock further areas. It can be a little confusing to navigate at first, but it’s not particularly large, and eventually its main function is to serve as a hub from which you set out to take down four lords in thrall to a mysterious figure known as Mother Miranda. The first and most striking of these locations is Castle Dimitrescu, home to the nine-foot-tall Lady Dimitrescu, who stalks you around the place in a similar fashion to prior &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; villains like Nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acaPu1"&gt;Castle Dimitrescu is classic &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;, and the game settles into a familiar rhythm of locked doors, light puzzles, and little-by-little progression as you uncover more of the map. This loop is as satisfying as it’s ever been, but unlike in &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;, I rarely found it to be scary because of the greater focus on action. There’s only so much tension that can build up when you’re using your shotgun this often. And that holds for most of the rest of the game, as you travel to new areas that largely serve as theatrical preludes to showdowns with Miranda’s other followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ8xvM"&gt;Speaking of those showdowns, the boss fights in &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; are one of the more notable improvements over its predecessor. Most of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;’s fights were frustrating and unsatisfying, but Capcom has embraced spectacle to great effect for &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest battles. They’re not necessarily titanic challenges or complex brain-teasers, but they’re at least memorable, and that’s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil Village" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thaBeu9d7XGJiAiNwaQZeux1-XQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493149/RE_Village_Apr_2021_Screens_09.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKcn8G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; has its atmospheric moments, to be sure, but they’re not the main event. There are lengthy sections of the game that are structured more or less like a first-person shooter. The puzzles are mostly straightforward, and you’ll rarely find yourself without the means to fight back against enemies. There’s nothing quite as bombastic as the worst excesses of &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s one encounter in particular that leans hard into psychological horror, but &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; sometimes feels more like something from the &lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;/em&gt; series than any of its own predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2U7c4z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; was controversial in its own time, of course, with some longtime series fans bemoaning its similar shift away from survival horror. Now it’s considered one of the most revolutionary action games of all time. But &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have that going for it. While it takes heavy inspiration from &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, it’s still mostly an iteration on &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;, and the result is just another remixed &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqaDMN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; is a good game worth playing, and I think it’s very much a solid numbered entry in the series even if Capcom doesn’t want to call it one. But by transparently blending elements of &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, two of the most dramatic overhauls in series history, it feels less noteworthy than either. As such, the way you feel about it is likely to come down to how you feel about &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3I84cj"&gt;If you’re in it for the outlandish characters and labyrinthine level design, you’ll probably love &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;. If you’d hoped &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt; would spark a fresh new direction for the series, though, you might be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD1VNk"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on May 7th on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Steam, and Stadia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Before Baccalaureate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Www6qWwd0MmN3hSdPzTwuHf7wU=/50x0:5950x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169817/1232456637.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its practices — including links to excerpts of the source code, which he’d posted on Pastebin. Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen sent Johnson a direct message on Twitter requesting that he remove the code from Pastebin, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. After Johnson refused, Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice, and three of the tweets were removed. (They were reinstated after &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on the controversy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK8Nb1"&gt;In its lawsuit, the EFF is arguing that Johnson made fair use of Proctorio’s code and that the company’s takedown “interfered with Johnson’s First Amendment right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgOb4R"&gt;“Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,” said EFF Staff Attorney Cara Gagliano &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7SqdE"&gt;“I’m doing this to stand up against student surveillance, as well as abuses of copyright law,” Johnson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This isn’t the first, and won’t be the last time a company abuses copyright law to try and make criticism more difficult. If nobody calls out this abuse of power now, it’ll just keep happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nj7LRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"},{"title":"An ed-tech specialist spoke out about remote testing software — and now he’s being sued ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9pKcoR"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that schools use to watch for cheating on remote tests. Its use exploded last year with the rise of remote learning; the platform proctored over 16 million exams. The software records students through their webcams as they work and monitors the position of their heads while they take exams. It flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. It also enables instructors to track the websites students visit during the exam period and to bar them from functions like copying and pasting text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbshw"&gt;Students and instructors around the country have volleyed numerous criticisms against Proctorio, claiming it violates student privacy and has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374386/proctorio-racial-bias-issues-opencv-facial-detection-schools-tests-remote-learning"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against marginalized students. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the service (and four others) in December, calling it “inherently invasive.” A coalition of US senators, including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), cited similar concerns about Proctorio in an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IrTuL"&gt;Proctorio has engaged critics in court before, although more often as a plaintiff. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Last October&lt;/a&gt;, the company sued a technology specialist at the University of British Columbia who made a series of tweets criticizing the platform. The thread contained links to unlisted YouTube videos, which Proctorio claimed contained confidential information. The lawsuit drew ire from the global education community: hundreds of university faculty, staff, administrators, and students have signed an &lt;a href="https://blog.communityofpraxis.ca/2020/09/03/in-defence-of-ian-linkletter/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; in the specialist’s defense, and a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for his legal expenses has raised $60,000 from over 700 donors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgbqJ1"&gt;“We disagree that sharing confidential information is the same thing as criticism,” Olsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;at the time. “Posting these kinds of things...it risks students learning how to circumvent the software, and it risks the safety and security of millions of students who use the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6m2OK"&gt;“We are aware of the lawsuit,” a Proctorio spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;Proctorio will vigorously defend itself on the merits and expects to be fully vindicated in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmuRhy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd, 3:46PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Erik Johnson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1cjwi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 10:57AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Proctorio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s Labor Department reverses Trump-era gig worker rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Transportation Union And Rideshare Drivers United Members Hold Rolling Vehicle Protest Calling On State To Enforce AB5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pSc4ZRa3L3NLokeI6vNkCJVGs4=/0x4:5317x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240336/1219237615.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XabTnL"&gt;The US Department of Labor withdrew a Trump-era rule that would have made it easier for “gig economy” companies like Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as independent contractors. The reversal doesn’t change any gig workers’ current employment status, but it does signal that the Biden administration is taking a less friendly stance toward this sector of the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uvUGx"&gt;The rule was finalized in early January, before Biden took office, and would have made it more difficult for gig workers to be reclassified as employees under federal law. Over the years, some gig workers have fought to be classified as employees so they could qualify for benefits like paid sick leave, health insurance, and minimum wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qfEk8z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Stop the erosion of worker protections”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NXUHgW"&gt;Among the reasons cited for reversing the rule, the labor department said it was “in tension” with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and would have “undermined” current jurisprudence on gig work in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkCHeR"&gt;“By withdrawing the Independent Contractor Rule, we will help preserve essential worker rights and stop the erosion of worker protections that would have occurred had the rule gone into effect,” said Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0fbPX"&gt;Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and other companies won a huge victory last November with the passage of Prop 22 in California. The ballot measure would exempt those companies from a state law that would have required them to classify their workers as employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;The companies aggressively opposed the law&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it would eliminate worker flexibility, while also increasing consumer prices and wait times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipO4Ey"&gt;Biden opposed Prop 22, arguing it was an attempt by gig economy companies to “gut” California’s AB5 law. “It’s unacceptable,” he tweeted on May 26th, 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g6dkLm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Last year California passed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AB5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AB5&lt;/a&gt;, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.&lt;/p&gt;— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1265472291099549699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks2aTO"&gt;Among the gig economy companies, Uber has been the most forceful about taking its vision for the future of work to the national stage. The company has long advocated for a “third way” to classify its drivers. Last spring, in the midst of rising COVID-19 infections, Uber CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21190806/uber-coronavirus-driver-protections-economic-stimulus"&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi penned a letter to President Trump&lt;/a&gt; advocating for federal legislation that would provide drivers with certain financial benefits while still classifying them as independent contractors. And the company has been lobbying for Prop 22-like legislative action in multiple states across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDW2IC"&gt;But that could be tough to accomplish with Democrats in control of the government. Last September, a coalition of top Democratic officials introduced a bill that would tighten the federal test for classifying workers as independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton recalls its treadmills following series of accidents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A runner trains on the Peloton Tread." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSwc8BvJLl6e5bIPSjtqfx5pO10=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240300/akrales_190328_3240_0158.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJCBbN"&gt;Peloton is issuing a voluntary recall for all of its treadmill products — including both the Peloton Tread and Tread Plus — following a series of accidents that have resulted in multiple injuries and at least one death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsMrLn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Died-and-More-than-70-Incidents-Reported"&gt;In the recall announcement today&lt;/a&gt; for the Tread Plus, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) elaborates that it’s received “72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTXh1g"&gt;The two products are being recalled for different reasons: while there are concerns with the Tread Plus that people may be pulled underneath the treadmill, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury"&gt;the regular Tread has issues&lt;/a&gt; where the touchscreen at the front may fall off and cause injury. The CPSC says that the recall will impact about 125,000 Tread Plus units and around 1,050 units of the regular Tread (plus an additional 5,400 Tread treadmills in Canada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zHLlE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both the Tread Plus and Tread are being recalled for separate issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YdxBn4"&gt;The announcement is a serious about-face for the company, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;as of late April was still fighting&lt;/a&gt; with the CPSC to avoid a full recall despite the fact that a Tread Plus treadmill was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved in the death of a child&lt;/a&gt; in March. The CPSC has already issued a warning to Tread Plus owners cautioning that the treadmill poses “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xMXmf"&gt;Peloton had previously refuted the CPSC’s reports, which it called “inaccurate and misleading,” telling customers in April that “there is no reason to stop using the Tread Plus,” so long as they were following Peloton’s safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pd4mnQ"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury"&gt;apologized for that decision&lt;/a&gt; in the announcement of the recall, stating that “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset.” Foley also promised to work with the CPSC on new industry standards for treadmill safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR1FK7"&gt;Tread Plus owners will have the option to voluntarily return their treadmills to Peloton for a full refund through November 6th, 2022. Customers who want to keep their treadmill are being offered additional safety measures, too: Peloton will move the treadmill to another room in owner’s houses for free and is promising software improvements to automatically lock the Tread Plus after use and to add a four-digit PIN to unlock it for future use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kVphU"&gt;Tread owners, meanwhile, will have a similar option to return their treadmills, or they can wait for Peloton to come by and physically improve the touchscreen’s attachment to the rest of the treadmill to prevent future risk of it falling off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap can be sued for fueling a fatal car crash with its speed filter, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nob2KA8coSVIv8cKHdyjYubLElg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69239993/snapEyes.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EjsEv3"&gt;Snap can be sued over a Snapchat speed filter that allegedly encouraged reckless driving, despite the generally broad legal protections for social networks. The Ninth Circuit Appeals Court &lt;a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf"&gt;revived a case&lt;/a&gt; that was dismissed in 2020, reversing an earlier ruling that favored Snap. It concluded that even if users were populating the filter with their own high driving speeds, Snap could still be liable for implicitly rewarding that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwwcU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmon v. Snap&lt;/em&gt; was filed after a 20-year-old Snapchat user crashed his car while using the filter, at one point driving over 120 miles per hour. The 2017 crash killed the driver and two teenage passengers. Two of the victims’ parents sued Snap for wrongful death, saying its combination of an opaque achievement system and speed filter enticed users to drive at unsafe speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="qLokoL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlG7ha"&gt;The parents claimed many teenagers believed — and that Snap knew they believed — they’d get a secret achievement for hitting speeds of 100 miles per hour. Snap countered that no such achievement existed and that it was just providing a tool for users to post their own content, an action mostly shielded under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9hlOC"&gt;The Ninth Circuit didn’t rule on whether Snap was liable. But it concluded that it wasn’t protected here by Section 230, which prevents sites and apps from being sued over what users post. Instead, it said the lawsuit “presents a clear example of a claim that simply does not rest on third-party content.” The company “indisputably designed” the reward system and speed filter, which allegedly created a defective product. “In short, Snap, Inc. was sued for the predictable consequences of designing Snapchat in such a way that it allegedly encouraged dangerous behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMzqFb"&gt;A lower court reached a different conclusion last year. As &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/03/snapchats-speed-filter-protected-by-section-230-lemmon-v-snap.htm"&gt;legal blogger Eric Goldman explains&lt;/a&gt;, it called the filter “essentially a speedometer tool” and noted that Snapchat warned users against driving at high speeds. The lawsuit, it said, was trying to hold Snap liable for a user acting dangerously and posting about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYLIu2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The driver allegedly thought Snapchat would give him a trophy for hitting 100 miles per hour&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrAlbt"&gt;Snap’s speed filter has a tortured history in court. An Uber driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11526860/snapchat-mph-filter-speeding-car-accident-suit"&gt;sued the company separately&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 after he collided with a Snapchat user allegedly trying to hit 100 miles per hour. In that case, a lower court &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;initially side with the driver, but a Georgia appeals court &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/10/snapchat-isnt-liable-for-its-speed-filter-even-if-section-230-doesnt-apply-maynard-v-snapchat.htm"&gt;reversed the decision&lt;/a&gt; and said Snapchat’s speed filter wasn’t designed to encourage speeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pW5Bfr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmon v. Snap&lt;/em&gt;’s revival&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cites a landmark 2008 ruling &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2008/04/roommatescom_de_1.htm"&gt;against Roommates.com&lt;/a&gt;, which found that Section 230 didn’t apply when the site specifically guided users to answer potentially discriminatory questions like their racial preferences, even if users were the ones actually supplying the answers. Roommates.com still ended up &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210207/15514446202/if-were-going-to-talk-about-discrimination-online-ads-we-need-to-talk-about-roommatescom.shtml"&gt;winning the overall lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and Snap could prevail in this case, but &lt;em&gt;Lemmon v. Snap&lt;/em&gt; would set a precedent for interpreting Section 230 unless the Supreme Court took it up — which it’s declined to do for Section 230-related cases so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXniiB"&gt;Some earlier &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/grindr-harassment-case-wont-get-supreme-court-review"&gt;high-profile suits&lt;/a&gt; have also basically argued that a social network is defective for facilitating conduct like harassment, only to be defeated on Section 230 grounds. This ruling hints that this court wouldn’t necessarily be sympathetic to those claims, though. It distinguishes the Snap case from what it calls “creative pleading” designed to get around the law, and it applies that label to suits that, “at bottom, depended on a third party’s content.” Even so, it’s one of relatively few major court rulings limiting Section 230’s scope — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302850/section-230-reform-internet-speech-moderation-platforms"&gt;at a time&lt;/a&gt; when the law is increasingly embattled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best video game subscription deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCwJnaJqB9nSAdB083CzqHiRqPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69062112/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ve6XpF"&gt;Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAgFMs"&gt;While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="75ZAPD"&gt;PlayStation subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2CYtx"&gt;PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you can play for free so long as you have an active subscription. If you own a PS5, you have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PS Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining games” originally released for the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouXbHO"&gt;A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally retails for $60, but &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fpsn-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba&lt;/a&gt; tends to sell digital keys for US subscribers for less than half of its usual price. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US players can grab a year for $27&lt;/a&gt; by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAYPROMO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. You can even get two years’ worth of service for $54. Otherwise, it is $60 per year at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465838929287529#donlotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-plus-1-year-membership%2F10084626.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. The service is also available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B017V6YVDC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK57U?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 for three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQl0wf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eA7sP"&gt;PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming service, allowing subscribers to stream games released on the PS2, PS3, and PS4 on their PS4, PS5, and PCs. The service tends to release new games into the library regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6jNP0"&gt;New users can do a seven-day free trial to get a feel for the service. Otherwise, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B00ZGG1HZA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt; costs $10, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465889242682683#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of the service&lt;/a&gt; in advance costs $25, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year-long subscription&lt;/a&gt; is $60. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-now-12-month-subscription-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba has a one-year subscription available for $59&lt;/a&gt;, which is $1 off its usual price although Sony recently had a promotion where new subscribers could get one month free of charge. Alternatively, it is $60 at typical retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-now-1-year-subscription%2F11097720.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LMQ2H"&gt;Xbox subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuSn3s"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s flagship gaming subscription right now. Subscribing to this service nets you access to Game Pass Console and Game Pass PC. It bundles Xbox Live Gold, a premium online service. Additionally, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, is included with Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkcdOo"&gt;You can choose between &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a monthly plan for $15&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $45. If you are new to Game Pass, you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get your first month for $1&lt;/a&gt;, and it will convert to a $15 monthly charge unless you cancel. If you are not a new user of the service but want to renew your subscription for one month only, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1-month-subscription-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba is selling a single month for $20&lt;/a&gt;. If you want three months but don’t want to be billed automatically, you can grab it for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for its usual $45 price tag at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-3-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832350399%3FDescription%3DXbox%2520Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate%26cm_re%3DXbox_Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate-_-32-350-399-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-3-Month-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Microsoft-Digital-Download%2F309259942%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZo2dI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tchitw"&gt;Outside of Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft has two separate versions of the service, including one specifically for Xbox consoles, which is probably the better choice for gamers who solely play on the Xbox and are not interested in the other incentives offered by the Ultimate Tier. Again, you can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model for $1 if you are new&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt;, $60 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07BKXDW67?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six months&lt;/a&gt;, or $120 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07K782P3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full-year subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5pUly"&gt;Another subscription available on consoles is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play?join-now=true" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EA Play&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to a slew of titles published by Electronic Arts. It’s available on a few platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-Access-12-Month-Subscription/dp/B014Q5UNH4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=EA+Play&amp;amp;qid=1617219222&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5498-CUSA15087_00-PSEAA1M000000000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, but the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;included with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; now. If you are subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate and buy an EA Play subscription, it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;convert to a certain number&lt;/a&gt; of days or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lh5L5F"&gt;Nintendo subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVh6Q6"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is a good service for owners of Nintendo’s hybrid console if they want to do the following: play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, or get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era. It comes in two forms: an individual membership, which provides access and perks through a single account, or a family membership, which provides access to the service via the same or multiple Switch consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haNwb6"&gt;You can get a seven-day free trial for both. Otherwise, an individual membership costs &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$4 for one month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV61ZC9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$8 for three&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 for a full year&lt;/a&gt;. You can do it directly through Nintendo’s eShop on the Switch itself; retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/nintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership?partner=voxmedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership%2F176406.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership-nintendo-switch-digital%2F-%2FA-78630258&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also sell three-month or one-year subscriptions. The best deal currently is at Eneba, which is selling &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-3-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months for $6&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full year for $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jEWRuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPkA27"&gt;Family Memberships only include a full-year subscription, which you can buy for $35 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473860075502827#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo eShop&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IcYUKQ"&gt;PC gaming subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qoeGMy"&gt;Xbox Game Pass for PC is available as a standalone service for those with a gaming PC who do not want all of the perks available with Game Pass Ultimate. Like the console version, Game Pass PC is available for $10 a month or $1 for your first month if you are a new user. Typically, retailers sell the PC-only service for three months, which is normally priced at $30. Currently, Eneba has &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-1-month-microsoft-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one month available&lt;/a&gt; for $8 or &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-3-month-windows-10-store-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIGoSB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMlkSB"&gt;EA Play is also available on PC, but the prices vary depending on whether you subscribe on Steam or Origin. If you &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriptions/ea#SaleSection_77945" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it is the same price as consoles ($5 per month, $30 annually). &lt;a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/ea-play" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Origin has EA Play Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 monthly or $100 per year. The key biggest difference between EA Play and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pro is the Pro version provides unlimited access to the publisher’s latest releases, similar to how Game Pass provides access to Xbox exclusives on the day those titles release. &lt;/p&gt;

You also receive access to new releases at launch, over 100 games in the library, and Amazon’s Luna and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming services. You can subscribe to a monthly plan, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22348957%2Fbest-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $15 each month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fayzzi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nx27Nw"&gt;Originally released in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?partner=VoxMedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Humble Monthly) is a Humble Bundle gaming subscription. Each month, the company allows subscribers to choose from a curated list of 10 or more DRM-free games, which they can keep forever. Unlike some other services by the company, all of the games are revealed upfront. It comes in &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/checkout?partner=VoxMedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Lite ($5 per month), Basic ($15 per month), and Premium ($20 per month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVTwM0"&gt;Mobile game subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YZZ3M2"&gt;Released in 2019, Apple Arcade has its own dedicated tab located on the App Store. It is available on products that run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. It costs $5 per month, or you can get a year for just $50. All of the games available on the service are free of in-app purchases and pesky ads and the option to play these games offline. Subscribers can also share access with five other individuals via family sharing. New users can get a one-month free trial. &lt;/p&gt;

It features over 800 apps and games with no ads or in-app purchases. You can subscribe for $5 monthly or $30 annually. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PS Plus for less than the cost of one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBYE42djwLHyompc99WcpwgBZCY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69239812/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1CKVGH"&gt;Whether you own a PS4 or PS5, you probably want to have PS Plus service to be able to play games online and to get complimentary offerings from Sony in the form of games each month. Through Sony, one year of PS Plus costs $60, but Eneba is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a special discount that’ll double it to two years’ worth of service for just $54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar2HiJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Go here and hit “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt; near the top of the page. Then at checkout, make sure to double your quantity to two instead of one, then enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAYPROMO &lt;/strong&gt;to knock the price from around $60 down to $54. You’ll get two codes, and you can redeem each one into your console as needed when it comes time to replenish your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi5hhp"&gt;With PS Plus on PS5, you’ll gain access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus selection of games&lt;/a&gt;. On either Sony’s PS5 or the last-gen PS4, you’ll get a monthly assortment of games available to keep, so long as you have a membership. &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/28/playstation-plus-games-for-may-battlefield-v-stranded-deep-wreckfest-drive-hard-die-last/"&gt;This month’s batch&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wreckfest&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranded Deep&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mmLEtt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75zpiB"&gt;Best Buy is selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739695798841719539" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a few different iPhone battery cases&lt;/a&gt; at a steep discount, including ones made for the iPhone 7, iPhone XR, and the whole iPhone 11 lineup (for the iPhone 11 phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974475/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-camera-smart-battery-case-shortcut-button" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s battery case has a nifty camera shortcut button&lt;/a&gt;). Normally, these cost around $130, but you can get them for no more than $52. Given that these can extend your iPhone’s battery life significantly (at the cost of adding some serious heft and thickness), it might be worth the purchase for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gUdtYP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10483983"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wUoj2S"&gt;If you’re looking for a good Apple Watch SE deal and want the LTE-enabled model, B&amp;amp;H Photo might have you sorted today. It’s selling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594568-REG%2Fapple_myyu2ll_a_watch_nike_se_gps.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F5%2F22420735%2Fplaystation-ps-plus-membership-sony-apple-battery-case-iphone-watch-nike-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nike-branded model in the 40mm sizing for $289&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $10 more than the usual price for the GPS-enabled base model. If you don’t like the Nike sport band, you can easily swap it out for a different look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Italy Continues Nationwide Lockdown To Control Coronavirus Spread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBOloN_0dkwsgGMSI0vJ1f76A3Y=/0x1111:2667x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66922524/1214094439.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things may be starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit face-to-face association and most of us are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCcs6d"&gt;There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats. We’ve left them out because they require that all participants be members of a specific social network (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime, which is Apple-only). We’ve also tried to concentrate on applications that allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host), and that allow at least ten or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8yIwt"&gt;A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and those of your friends. This list is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6libON"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LQuFKh"&gt;The most popular video meeting app&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5zsGsMM_zzRUfccXF_2EdkoflI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_1.20.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CYiJpA"&gt;Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps — in fact, its name is quickly becoming synonymous with video meetings. Before the pandemic hit, the company pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it also provides a free basic version for individuals. At first, because Zoom didn’t expect its sudden popularity among non-business users, there were several missteps involving privacy and security; the company quickly instituted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230962/zoom-update-security-privacy-features-improvements-download"&gt;a number of changes and updates&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nndg"&gt;The free version of Zoom allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which can be pretty limiting. As of this writing, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fcovid19.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering help and advice&lt;/a&gt; to new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BYNFVw"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHNl6l"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b91yn2"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JIlwSK"&gt;Group meetings: 40-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XpI4G1"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kF9xF4"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FqBb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; Meet Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StW6sf"&gt;A longtime go-to for online calls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjOAVSTCxLE9SAzc8jmS5cISMQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489407/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.42.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOsT4"&gt;Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since the beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (which is accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows for videoconferencing; up to 50 people can meet with a generous four-hour time limit on meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB02lU"&gt;There is also a separate page that lets you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Ffree-conference-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;create a free video meeting&lt;/a&gt; without having to actually sign up for the service. However, you get more features using the app, so if you’re okay with registering for a free account, you’re better off doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FQrF4L"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lgPZGp"&gt;Maximum participants: 50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PS5plA"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3x7cKx"&gt;Group meetings: Four hours per call, 10 hours per day, 100 hours per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oFvVzA"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDu0pA"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5SlZUs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webex.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cisco Webex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4k2CRu"&gt;A corporate app with a solid freemium version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah3jKqqaHJRvvLdrj0b-aTaTz0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489405/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.49.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcIFOJ"&gt;Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s; it was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a &lt;a href="https://cart.webex.com/sign-up-webex?experienceType=Unified&amp;amp;ft=selfsignup"&gt;fairly generous free version&lt;/a&gt; that’s worth checking out. During the current pandemic, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, and you can meet for up to 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iVgdLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B6FO7y"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZhF2Xh"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTTnlh"&gt;Group meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruv0bm"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3aAMO5"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7pIZFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5QusdH"&gt;Now featured on your Gmail page&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7O1n6NkE0ge6ERXOwjV7S5TmVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489403/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.52.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msl2WU"&gt;Meet offers a very simple and efficient way to video chat with colleagues, friends, and family — assuming they all have Google accounts, which is a requirement for both hosts and participants. In fact, Google is not only pushing people to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;its Meet videoconferencing app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom but also instead of its own soon-to-be-sundowned Google Hangouts app. (We previously included Google Hangouts in this roundup, but Hangouts users are now being actively urged from within the app to use Google Meet for their video chats.) You can find a Meet link in the Gmail app and in every appointment you make using Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v1Sc5Q"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ndFlQU"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9l2AqB"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Vykzc"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour limit through June 28th, one-hour limit after&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a6cOEo"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JUU1Sr"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h4bFcC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fteams-for-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0gleS7"&gt;Not just for business&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e6cKl0CUoE2ruyM1Bb3kGununBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489400/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.58.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="celGBu"&gt;Microsoft Teams was built as a competitor to Slack and is an especially good idea if you’re part of the Office ecosystem. While the application is mainly focused on business use, Microsoft has stepped out of its three-piece suit and unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349783/microsoft-teams-texting-calls-videoconferencing-how-to"&gt;a free personal version of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone chat, talk, or have video meetings — you just have to create an account with Microsoft in order to use it. Currently, due to the pandemic, Microsoft has extended the maximum number of participants from 100 to 300, and it has pushed the time limit from 60 minutes to 24 hours, which gives it an edge over most other free videoconferencing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z7fDpG"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VPM1Xz"&gt;Maximum participants: Normally 100; extended to 300 during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3OY8iA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MaDoxu"&gt;Group meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OU4H3U"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lqJ1wZ"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdqxTy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duo.google.com/about/"&gt;Google Duo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdg4C0"&gt;A mobile app best suited to one-to-ones&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycUHduEC2TCTGPyGnIbxdxIf4Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489396/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.01.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0KN9x"&gt;You don’t really expect Google to only offer one simple videoconferencing app, do you? Besides Google Meet, Google also has its mobile app Duo, which was built as a consumer app (whereas Meet was originally designed as a business app). While Duo was first touted as the app to use for one-to-one conversations and could only be used on phones, it now allows you to create groups of up to 32 participants and includes a web app. All participants must have Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrdSff"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aqu3zn"&gt;Maximum participants: 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k4gNud"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rd9Yef"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Tah4o"&gt;Screen sharing: Mobile only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdHECg"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSGznj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.starleaf.com/resources/remote-working-hub/"&gt;StarLeaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="05W8yJ"&gt;A corporate meeting app with a free basic version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xVXExpwfdFlYEda9IYnq6kfTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489394/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.08.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzst4"&gt;If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf. It’s really a platform for companies rather than individuals; its lowest-cost paid plan starts with five licenses suitable for a small business. But it is now offering a basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWyY2P"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W5dlgk"&gt;Maximum participants: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hGcJD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gtv4JL"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uPfKjn"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gxuvie"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TzLjf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si/"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Zxxcw"&gt;Open source with plenty of features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVwxTZMGAegmePx6edtBU9gdi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489390/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.11.38_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYifcw"&gt;Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply navigating to the site and clicking on “Start meeting.” If you’re a developer, you can build your own conferencing app via &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/"&gt;Jitsi Videobridge&lt;/a&gt;, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as fake backgrounds, chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VhdHjO"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JlbkKB"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bN9uN0"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3n0cX0"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GpB4PM"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCwVWj"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEZRsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://whereby.com/"&gt;Whereby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0tRyD7"&gt;Single meeting rooms with up to 50 participants&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47xmn6lLGej9EWf2brZ_EXrP7f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489313/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.13.49_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3ZHs"&gt;Whereby’s free version gives you the use of a single meeting room with up to 50 participants, along with the ability to lock rooms (participants have to “knock” to gain entrance). Each room has its own URL that you get to choose, which is great — assuming that nobody else has already taken that name. (For example, I first tried &lt;a href="http://whereby.com/testroom"&gt;whereby.com/testroom&lt;/a&gt; and found it was already taken.) But it also has a chat function, lets you share a screen, allows you to mute or eject users, and offers breakout groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQQ6g6"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kgniVF"&gt;Maximum participants: 50	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rbf1TD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bJgo7v"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MknVjh"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EXQvVY"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UgY0PE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZ2xUb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glip.com/"&gt;Glip Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YTpiKZ"&gt;A wide range of free features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsGToiLppKzDnrooRK78tgpe8E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489298/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.18.20_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVdrv"&gt;Glip Pro offers a nice range of features for a free video meeting app. It does insist that you have either a work email address or a Google account, and wants access to your contacts on that account. But if you’re good with that, you get 24 hours of meeting time (as long as you sign up by July), screen sharing, recording, chat, and virtual backgrounds, among others. It even offers closed captions (although, as with a lot of AI transcription software, some of the captions leave something to be desired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d0yA3C"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u3cQbc"&gt;Maximum participants: 100 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mm37EN"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by July 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hVRYgE"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by July 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OxL6TK"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWP4sP"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cL6ktK"&gt;More alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oQsh6Y"&gt;There is a wide range of other Zoom alternatives out there, including &lt;a href="https://www.remotehq.com/"&gt;RemoteHQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://talky.io/"&gt;Talky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.8x8.com/"&gt;8x8&lt;/a&gt; (which acquired Jitsi in 2018). Some of these don’t have a free version or the number of participants who can use the free version is limited. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluejeans.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlueJeans&lt;/a&gt; starts at $9.99 per month for unlimited-time meetings with up to 100 participants, while the free version of &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/meeting/"&gt;Zoho Meeting&lt;/a&gt; only permits a maximum of three participants, and &lt;a href="https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing"&gt;Intermedia AnyMeeting&lt;/a&gt; allows four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nhBhm"&gt;Other apps offer some video meeting as an added feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is mainly set up for text chat, but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.spikenow.com/"&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt;, an email service, also allows free one-to-one video calls, and the messaging app &lt;a href="https://signal.org/en/"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; offers group video calls with a maximum of eight participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAFyA"&gt;There are also apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21229590/houseparty-how-to-video-chat-call-games-talk-friends-app-ios-android"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;, which lets up to eight people use a virtual room to chat. In fact, anybody can drop into a friend’s online session without an invitation (although you can “lock” your room to prevent intruders). However, it does demand that all participants register in order to use it — and registration includes your name, email address, birthdate, and phone number. So we didn’t include it among our recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0ADE9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 4th, 2021, 2:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 11th, 2020. Since then, all entries have been updated; in addition, two apps have been dropped (Hangouts and Spike) and Glip Pro has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fBE0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 2021, 9:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect the fact that Whereby’s breakout groups feature is out of beta and to add Signal to the list of alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
