    <title>Over 500 Activision Blizzard employees petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotick </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TE5Cng"&gt;Over 500 employees and contractors at Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSbxdA-egrhAK6TcydVcrTqQDDjU7QE4j4jpjwCO2pUIYFmtTjLksl7EBALc8O_Jla2qT1Oy0H5zn66/pub"&gt;signed and published a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove CEO Bobby Kotick from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XCMZne"&gt;“We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard. The information that has come to light about his behaviors and practices in the running of our companies runs counter to the culture and integrity we require of our leadership—and directly conflicts with the initiatives started by our peers. We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dc9ehl"&gt;In a surprising move, the petition goes on to list the names, titles, and departments of the workers, which could potentially expose the signatories to retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmDoy6"&gt;The petition comes days after a bombshell report alleging Kotick knew about, enabled, and even participated in a culture of misconduct and harassment that has drawn the attention of government authorities. In response, the company’s board of directors issued a statement saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;continue to support Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;a small group of shareholders demanded his removal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgqnBJ"&gt;This petition is the latest development in a series of worker-led actions against the company, which now includes two walkouts and the formation of an employee advocacy group, A Better ABK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nt7QpR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lG5ZOWYnElGYRkwdymZupYyprWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160990/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple employees will return to offices February 1st | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four or five days a week if their roles require more time in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyCOxO"&gt;Cook first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;hybrid work model in June&lt;/a&gt;, when the company was planning a September return to offices that was moved back to October, then January, and now, to February. Some Apple employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, writing in an internal letter to Cook that they wanted a more flexible policy that allowed anyone who wanted to work from home to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzcW1d"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for more details on the company’s office return. Following widespread closures of Apple stores during the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopened its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with mask requirements in place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants to launch a self-driving EV in 2025 with a custom chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FVtbo2763oZyprM7_3rrzX2D04=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160939/acstro_190902_apple_event_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal now for Project Titan, after multiple pivots, is to create an autonomous car that does not have a steering wheel. The interior would be spacious and look more like the limousine-style seating arrangement that EV startup Canoo has promoted in its electric van prototypes. Apple was at one point in talks to acquire Canoo, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;recently hired one of the startup’s co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a large, iPad-style touchscreen display that will run a user interface similar to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPgvES"&gt;The business model is reportedly still undecided, though. Apple has considered trying to create a self-driving fleet to compete with Uber, Lyft, and Waymo (something Tesla has proposed but is still very far from executing), but Gurman reports that the “more likely scenario” is that Apple will sell the cars to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZlkdE"&gt;On the electric vehicle side of things, Apple is reportedly not looking to develop a proprietary charging cable for the car. Instead, it wants to make the vehicle compatible with the “combined charging system,” or CCS standard, which would make it possible to charge the vehicle at most public fast charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib1zFC"&gt;Of course, all of this comes after years of reported changes to the project, which was started in 2014. Five different executives have run Project Titan after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch took over earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The refocusing and timeline shift reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; could be a sign that there’s real progress being made with him at the helm, or it could just become the newest footnote in whatever the project turns into next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC votes to let people text ‘988’ to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBHUHcrXLOJXc9wmnSsoFW4jvnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160780/akrales_201017_4238_0143.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbAMJ5"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-text-988-access-suicide-prevention-lifeline"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to expand access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by letting people text 988 starting next year. Text message providers have to support the three-digit code by July 16th, 2022, which is when the code will go into effect. On that same date, people will also be able to dial 988 to access Lifeline following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;a 2020 FCC ruling&lt;/a&gt;. People in need of help before calling or texting 988 is an option can call 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or get connected to a counselor through an &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/"&gt;online chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2U877"&gt;FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1461369809828986887"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 6,000 Americans call the Lifeline on an average day. “As we know from 911, creating an easy-to-remember 3 digit number makes it easier for people to get help when they need it most,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1461369908089049093"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;. By allowing people to call or text the shorter 988 number, the Lifeline could be more accessible for people to turn to in a time of distress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s new $150 3-in-1 charger is the first to get Apple Watch Series 7 fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qCus9mdPGv8YvNCxvFWvOMd7sQ=/125x0:1976x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160686/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.40.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe | Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxkRI0"&gt;Belkin has a pair of new wireless Apple Watch chargers it’s announcing today, which are notably the first third-party chargers to support the newly added fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw8S32"&gt;The larger of the two is the $149.95 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz016%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, which follows in the footsteps of last year’s 3-in-1 Belkin charger. In addition to adding Series 7 fast charging, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;Belkin has ditched the odd sculptural design&lt;/a&gt; on the previous model in favor of a more normal-looking flat rectangular pad that will probably fit better on a nightstand. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKUMBJ0Oe14bbCcQ41uUJaZtDvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024679/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kl7fHl"&gt;The new charger aims to hit the perfect trio of Apple charging: full-speed 15W MagSafe charging for an iPhone, Series 7 fast charging for an Apple Watch, and a regular Qi charger for the AirPods. Of course, as has always been the case with Belkin’s combination chargers, the $150 price tag is far more than what it would cost to buy individual MagSafe, fast-charging Series 7 Apple Watch, and Qi chargers, meaning that you’re paying a decent premium for style and convenience here. That price also does include a 40W power adapter, so you’re at least getting a one-stop solution for your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK3Mgx"&gt;The other new charger here is a bit more baffling: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz015%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pop-up Apple Watch charging stand that costs $59.95. Despite the “portable” in the name, Belkin’s solo charger isn’t a battery pack-style setup for recharging an Apple Watch while you’re out and about. And even more baffling, that $60 price tag doesn’t include a power adapter: while there’s an integrated USB-C cable built into the stand, you’ll have to provide your own 20W wall adapter to actually use it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHQgQgrZSpBYCYdarKvgYBK6G-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024682/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DJhU"&gt;The net result is a larger, bulkier version of the fast-charging cable that Apple includes with every Apple Watch Series 7 — except that Belkin’s version costs literally twice the standalone cable’s $29 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63ZAiZ"&gt;Looking more broadly, though, is the fact that the new Belkin fast chargers show — once again — the intentional limits of Apple’s MFi program. The new chargers from Belkin are the only third-party fast chargers on the market right now, and if the pattern of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;last year’s glacial MagSafe rollout&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by, it’ll be some time before other companies are able to get the approval (and the parts) from Apple to make other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LSmFy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Vp3Hlv"&gt;Both the $59.95 BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch and 149.95 BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe are available to order today from Belkin and Apple’s respective websites in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, and China, with availability in more countries promised in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BTS fan Twitter accounts say they’re being targeted by copyright trolls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BTS’s Digital Single ‘Butter’ Release Press Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38RjMaSFCY659sjiEI2DMhAsCRA=/60x0:6144x4056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160572/1319740646.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvXJ9J"&gt;In the past several days, a number of headers, profile pictures, and tweets have disappeared across the wide network of BTS fan Twitter accounts. The culprit, the account owners say, is a recent barrage of fake DMCA takedown notices. Outcry from fans resulted in #TwitterMaliciousDMCA trending worldwide on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkQIWA"&gt;The owner of a fan account with over 233,000 followers, which posts videos, photos, and memes related to the South Korean band, claims that their original header and profile picture, as well as multiple tweets including their own screenshots and memes, have been taken down by the trolls over the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l70oPn"&gt;Per the owner’s screenshots, the attackers appear to have reposted the account’s header on a spoof website in a backdated post, then claimed to Twitter that the image was their own. The spoof websites appear to have been taken down as of this writing, but the account’s header remains suspended “in response to a report from the copyright holder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IN0Le6"&gt;“Not gonna lie, this has been making me rather anxious,” the account owner tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qeFqB1"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, with copyright harassment going on for the past 24hrs (4 strikes), I've decided to go private for the next few days – soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Updates will still go on, probably slower! If you'd like faster updates, feel free to join the Telegram channel (&lt;a href="https://t.co/SEPXep0fys"&gt;https://t.co/SEPXep0fys&lt;/a&gt;) – (1/3) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qjNnz0os9x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qjNnz0os9x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BTS UPDATES⁷ | @BTSdailyinfo (@BTSdailyinfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSdailyinfo/status/1455600959061516297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kRrRhc"&gt;The group claiming to be behind these attacks calls themselves Team Copyright, and purports to be based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The group’s Facebook page is full of screenshots indicating that its members are responsible for the various copyright takedowns. It’s also full of threatening and discriminatory posts — the group claims it will “destroy the toxic fanbase” and criticizes BTS for “promotion of atheism and homosexuality.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8a056"&gt;A number of prominent BTS fan accounts, many of which have millions of followers, appear to have been hit by these notices. The profile pictures and headers of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bts_worIdwide"&gt;@bts_worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charts_k"&gt;@charts_k&lt;/a&gt; (which tracks the band’s positions on various charts), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btsvotingorg"&gt;@btsvotingorg&lt;/a&gt; (which nudges followers to vote for the artists for music awards), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_Trans"&gt;@bts_trans&lt;/a&gt; (which shares English translations of the group’s social media posts), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taehyungpics"&gt;@taehyungpics&lt;/a&gt; (which posts periodic pictures of BTS member V) are all in copyright limbo as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGL4d"&gt;Fans have scrambled to create second accounts, but those still don’t appear to be safe — tweets from a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSUPDATESGER2"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt; for Germany’s fan base are currently suspended due to a copyright claim, while the group’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_UPDATES_GER"&gt;primary account&lt;/a&gt; has replaced its header and footer with blank colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esS97g"&gt;The attackers have even hit the band members a few times. Per screenshots widely shared among BTS fans, takedown notices resulted in the temporary removal of selfies from members &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jtoni_n/status/1448546895563870212"&gt;RM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joonlyricst/status/1431627242975678469"&gt;Suga&lt;/a&gt; that were posted from the band’s verified account over the summer, as well as the brief suspension of an official handle. (Both photos and the account have since been reinstated; Hybe, the label that manages BTS, has not responded to an inquiry about the reason behind their removals.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hyC6wB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They even took down actual photos posted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTS_twt&lt;/a&gt; and had suspended an official account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSW_official?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTSW_official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7fmD8KJ1YQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7fmD8KJ1YQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bora    (@modooborahae) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1461101912695189509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="10LTqy"&gt;Fans across Twitter have sprung to action, aggressively reporting the page to Facebook, tagging Twitter support in comments, and flooding Bangladesh’s minister of state for foreign affairs with tweets. Despite those efforts, Team Copyright’s page remains active as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdGGNW"&gt;Twitter and Facebook have not responded to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOwPFA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s better Battle Pass progression is now live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;promised changes to progression&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries has added “Play 1 game” challenges, which will “help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369371427688452"&gt;fixing bugs&lt;/a&gt; with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jdgdvh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt; players can now earn XP by completing matchmade games. The "Play 1 Game" Daily Challenge is worth 50 XP each. The Challenge deck is also being updated to better serve players of all skill levels. (1/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Halo Support (@HaloSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XP boost changes should help during Big Team Battles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes in practice to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aH9Sxd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 18th, 12:03PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The promised changes are now live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge is getting price tracking and leaked passwords features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdgXSjPEhRnjUyTxfSU4Oq7P1sU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160314/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lojPrL"&gt;Microsoft is planning to add a new price tracker to its Edge browser, as well as a new feature that will let people easily change their passwords if they’ve been leaked online. The price tracking feature will be available soon and is designed to track products you’ve recently viewed and alert you of price changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wiw9Xt"&gt;Microsoft has focused a lot on shopping improvements with its Edge browser and already has price comparison, price history, and built-in coupons in Edge. “This feature is coming soon and will be built into the browser, so you just need to browse as you normally would, and Microsoft Edge will let you know if any of the items you’ve recently looked at have changed in price,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176463"&gt;explains Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Lkr0"&gt;It’s not clear yet how Microsoft will handle the obvious privacy concerns of its browser tracking products you’re searching for online and their associated prices. Microsoft has traditionally offered a number of privacy-focused controls in Edge, so we’d expect to see similar options here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29tn9e"&gt;Speaking of privacy, Edge is also getting a new useful password tool. Microsoft is piloting a new feature in Edge that will make it easy to update your passwords if they’re leaked online. Edge already monitors leaked passwords if you allow it to do so, and soon you’ll be able to navigate directly to a site’s change password page for affected credentials. Edge will then create a new, unique, and strong password. “Easy update is only available across a limited number of sites to start, but we will be working diligently to expand this list in the coming months,” says Ben-Zur.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s latest purchase is about becoming the place you listen to everything</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1FS21PcLxlLha9cNWrzdC9s79A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160401/acastro_211117_4888_0002.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Why it bought an audiobook company&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hMjQy9"&gt;Last week, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776777/spotify-findaway-acquire-audiobooks-podcasts-buy"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to spend an undisclosed amount of money to acquire Findaway, an audiobook creation and distribution company that plays a major role in the industry. The announcement likely made sense to anyone who’s been paying attention to Spotify’s audio moves, but for those who haven’t, to sum it up plainly: Spotify wants to be the place you consume all audio. This purchase sets it up to achieve that goal. When you open Spotify this time next year, the app will likely highlight an &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert &lt;/em&gt;episode alongside Taylor Swift’s newest single alongside Barack Obama’s newest book. It’ll be a crowded, but potentially powerful, destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Saykos"&gt;At the same time, though, Spotify getting knee-deep in audiobooks is a wildly different proposition than podcasts. There are powerful publishers to handle, a separate revenue model, a higher barrier to entry, and lots of IP rights to navigate. In the interest of better understanding why Spotify sees a future in the space, let’s break it down by what you need to know when thinking about this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHoywu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findaway is Anchor for audiobooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ctjsox"&gt;Let’s start with the most approachable idea for us podcast folks. Akin to how Spotify bought Anchor to make recording and publishing a podcast easy, Findaway plays a similar role in the audiobook space. Now, it’s not as easy as recording audio on your phone, overlaying some music, and pressing publish to make an audiobook, at least a quality one. Audiobooks often involve a narrator, if not actors, audio clips, and more. It’s usually on the level of a highly produced podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx056k"&gt;Findaway operates a business called Voices that sets authors up with a narrator and ensures content gets made well, but in exchange, authors pay Findaway to make that happen and use their services. This offers a clear business opportunity for Spotify. It’ll interface with creators, something it already does through Anchor and its music work, and generate revenue at the same time. It likely can improve on Findaway’s tech, too, given that it has an entire team dedicated to cracking on-the-go recording in Anchor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPUmUH"&gt;Once a book is recorded, Findaway can distribute it, too, which generates revenue. This leads us to the next thing to think about in relation to this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="jmMVIB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zH8rAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findaway turns Spotify into an audiobook distributor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qv5SCk"&gt;Spotify will now play an integral role in the audiobook world — major publishing houses entrust Findaway to distribute their content to retailers, libraries, and listening platforms. Unlike in podcasting where hosts have an RSS feed they can input wherever they want their show to populate, audiobook publishers and authors generally work with a distributor to get their content to storefronts and make sure all the data is properly inserted, among other things. Findaway’s solution is called &lt;a href="https://audioengine.io/"&gt;AudioEngine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="853R2K"&gt;Mark Pearson, the CEO and founder of Libro.fm, which sells audiobooks and supports independent bookstores, says this distribution business is critical to consider when thinking about Spotify’s deal. His platform works with Findaway to bring books to the Libro.fm app in some cases, and he says the reason many publishers distribute through Findaway is because “what we [on the app side] do on the backend is actually not trivial,” he says. “There’s a lot that goes into it with metadata and files and to deliver that in an app format for the listener is really hard work.” This would be a lot of labor for one organization to handle adequately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNFQ5a"&gt;One familiar podcasting company is also already working with Findaway for distribution of its audiobooks: author Malcolm Gladwell’s Pushkin Industries. CMO Heather Fain tells me the team partners with Findaway to distribute their audiobooks everywhere other than Audible. The reason to do so is because it’s easier than managing the plethora of places where a book populates. Findaway distributes the audiobooks and makes sure they show up properly across various apps and platforms, including Apple Books, Kobo, public libraries, and Libro.fm. (Yes, there could be a world in which Spotify is providing audiobooks to Apple.) However the distribution deal is structured, Findaway is making money, representing a new revenue line for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ3E9n"&gt;Finally, there’s one more aspect of this deal to think about: &lt;strong&gt;Spotify will become a bookseller&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBGYlD"&gt;With Findaway on its side and audiobooks now seemingly a priority, Spotify will likely start selling them from within the app. This could be essential for Spotify in its quest to be the place people can get all their audio. It’s a retention strategy — don’t move to Audible for your audiobooks, stay on Spotify — and also might recruit people to the platform if the offering is competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2yZ0g"&gt;If Spotify sells books a la carte, the margins will be much higher compared to podcasts. Even a CPM of $50 in podcasting means a podcaster is only making five cents per listener. Charging each listener $15 for access to an audiobook is a more lucrative arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPJSFn"&gt;Plus, Spotify gets to double-dip on revenue: anywhere Findaway is involved, Spotify makes money — as a retailer, as well as through audiobook production and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYnfcK"&gt;Looking to the future, I imagine Spotify could end up offering different subscription tiers that allow paying subscribers to download an audiobook a month, a la Audible and others. It could also try to launch an unlimited audiobooks plan, like its Swedish competitor Storytel. There’s also the possibility of Spotify making an exclusives play where it signs deals with publishers and authors to bring books to its platform — a classic Audible move, but one that would make extra sense given Spotify’s penchant for exclusive podcasts. If Spotify can become a main place people buy and listen to audiobooks, in addition to all other audio, it also might be able to strong-arm publishers into putting more books on its platform at more favorable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WmNYig"&gt;If Spotify’s pace in the podcasting world is any indication, the audiobooks integration could happen fast. It only took Spotify two or so years to start claiming that it’s the top podcasting app. Can it do the same for audiobooks? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFL is attaching NFTs to tickets, and the Lions Thanksgiving game is on the list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philadelphia Eagles v Detroit Lions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5grE3J3uP8Pgxajj0w92Yy2Vak=/0x0:4662x3108/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160163/1350898110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Hey Jared, &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq" target="_blank"&gt;just read this&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll understand what NFTs are, ok?” | Photo by Nic Antaya/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKJCKz"&gt;Along with their usual dose of sports, beer, and violence, NFL fans will also get a digital token included with the purchase of tickets to certain games this season. Yes, they are &lt;a href="https://nfl.live-nfts.com/wallet"&gt;NFTs from the NFL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZYhvDz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The blockchain will never forget that you paid to see a Detroit Lions game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl1Hur"&gt;The first Virtual Commemorative Ticket game already happened on November 7th when the Cardinals played the 49ers, and the next one is scheduled for Thanksgiving during the Bears / Lions matchup. NFL club business development senior vice president Bobby Gallo says, “Leveraging the emerging world of NFTs is a new and exciting way for us to create additional value and to further engage with fans who attend select games by providing a virtual commemorative ticket. There is no better time than the upcoming holiday season to kick off this fun and engaging fan experience, starting with the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Day matchup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FHdXIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Vi2Aj"&gt;While it’s hard to understand why anyone would want non-fungible evidence that they paid to see the &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/teams/detroit-lions/"&gt;0-8-1&lt;/a&gt; Detroit Lions play football on a holiday instead of spending time with their loved ones or simply staying home and doing nothing at all, this is happening. Selecting the holiday game to highlight this promotion means that sitting around with your family this year will definitely include discussing what NFTs are — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;our explainer can help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pxlz5R"&gt;Fans who are scanned into the game using a Ticketmaster SafeTix ticket that they purchased on their own account can obtain their NFT via a link sent to their registered email address after the game. Buying the tickets from Ticketmaster, StubHub, or SeatGeek will make you eligible for the promotion, which is powered by &lt;a href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/topic/0TO6Q0000000xEFWAY/nft?language=en_US"&gt;Ticketmaster’s NFT marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xnUpYH"&gt;If you’re not attending the games in person but still want in, there are non-ticket NFTs on the way. The league says in an announcement, “In addition to the commemorative NFTs given to fans after attending select games, the marketplace will also offer a limited number of digital collectible NFTs across all 32 clubs for fans to purchase and collect. Fans will also have the opportunity to trade or sell their commemorative NFTs.” Later this season, the league &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-nflpa-and-dapper-labs-announce-new-nft-deal-to-create-exclusive-digital-vide"&gt;will partner&lt;/a&gt; with NBA Top Shot operator Dapper Labs to &lt;a href="https://nfl.dapperlabs.com/"&gt;sell digital video collectible NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XgQaao"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA on NFT: Top Shot is playing the long game in the NFT craze","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"},{"title":"Topps is releasing official NFT baseball cards","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379645/topps-mlb-basecall-cards-nft-collectible-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eDMrNp"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.ticketmaster.com/nfl-virtual-commemorative-tickets/"&gt;an associated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, minting of these NFTs happens “on an eco-friendly blockchain with a low carbon footprint.” Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785051/nft-collectibles-intellectual-property-decentralized-disney"&gt;efforts to create a “decentralized Disney”&lt;/a&gt; based on blockchain tech or &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/for-1-3-million-an-nft-and-stake-in-a-mexican-soccer-team?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;promises of a team ownership stake&lt;/a&gt;, these items fall strictly into the collectible category. They don’t come associated with every ticket, simply every purchase on an eligible account, so it’s impossible to predict exactly how many there will be or potential future value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uyZOU"&gt;Still, if digitally registered icons take off like their proponents keep saying they will, there’s a chance that you might be able to sell your Giants / Eagles commemorative token to someone one day, just like a ticket stub or signed jersey. But if it’s for the Lions game, then don’t worry — your best bet for creating a collectible is if they find another &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/11/20/9746130/nfl-catch-rule-controversies-calvin-johnson-referees"&gt;new and exciting way&lt;/a&gt; to not win.&lt;/p&gt;
