    <title>How Tencent’s sweeping new facial scans will catch Chinese kids playing past curfew</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yxM89i"&gt;Tencent, the biggest game company in the world, is rolling out facial recognition technology that will likely scan many gamers’ faces every single evening, aiming to catch minors breaking a gaming curfew and help prevent video game addiction (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/chinas-tencent-says-itll-use-face-recognition-to-keep-m-1847236584"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a lot of controversial concepts in one sentence, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQcE3D"&gt;Here’s what’s going on, according to the company and China games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7s1yB"&gt;In China, video game addiction prevention is literally the law of the land, one that’s been evolving for many years but recently hit some important milestones. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-video-game-ban-young.html"&gt;China introduced a law&lt;/a&gt; that banned minors from playing video games between 10PM and 8AM or from playing more than 90 minutes on a weekday. And as of June 1st, 2021, every game in the country is required to add a new authentication system that checks a player’s Chinese national identity (including their age) to help block underage players from going past those limits, all in the name of preventing video game addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hCjsPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video game addiction prevention is already the law of the land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OaV4F"&gt;Tencent had actually already been using Chinese IDs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18065048/tencent-chinese-user-id-age-video-games-playerunknown-battlegrounds-league-of-legends"&gt;for a couple years now&lt;/a&gt;, among &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17080988/tencent-honor-of-kings-video-game-contracts-children"&gt;other attempts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/4/15918624/tencent-china-gaming-addiction-honor-of-kings-limit"&gt;curb addiction&lt;/a&gt;, but the company tells us that underage players kept finding ways to get around them — like using their parents’ accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvykNd"&gt;The so-called “Midnight Patrol” facial recognition system is an attempt to check that an “adult” is actually an adult. It launched July 5th in over 60 mobile games, including the hits &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Game for Peace — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;aka China’s more patriotic version of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The facial recognition system is only for China and only for mobile games, the company confirms, so PC games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;are currently exempt. It’s all part of the company’s ongoing “Balanced Online Entertainment System” initiative, Tencent tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which also encompasses its “Parental Guardian Platform” and “Healthy Gameplay System” designed to let parents know what their kids are up to and remind users when they’ve played for too long, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGWtZd"&gt;According to Ahmad, whose firm Niko Partners sometimes works with Tencent, here’s how the facial recognition part of the system operates: “It will essentially detect if the person playing the game after midnight is doing so for a long time or spending a certain amount of money in the game, and it will tick a box in Tencent's backend and prompt the user to verify their identity through facial recognition, either through that database or through a database they’ve already used,” says Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4fGRW"&gt;Tencent says it doesn’t store any of the new scans itself; instead, it sounds like it’s building on China’s already-established state facial recognition surveillance system, and any scans Chinese users will have already given Tencent. Ahmad says all of Tencent’s games in China use WeChat IDs for login, and the “Midnight Patrol” can use China’s national citizen database of face photos to check against as well. China’s surveillance engine has also been used for more troubling things, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570225/us-sanctions-chinese-facial-recognition-silicon-valley-funding"&gt;like the country’s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fy8LY8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It uses cameras akin to Face ID, we’re told, so not something you’d fool with a photo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2YrCG"&gt;Tencent does make it sound like it won’t necessarily be scanning the faces of minors, though. When a user playing games after hours is prompted for a facial scan, they can simply refuse, at which point they’ll be treated as a minor and booted out of the game, according to a machine translation &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Cr17TKWQ3XcuNzDw085OLw"&gt;of Tencent’s press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvb1CH"&gt;Tencent actually &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45707469"&gt;started trialing this facial recognition system in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and Ahmad says it hasn’t changed much since then. He says the company also started running this kind of check last year when Tencent realized a lot of kids were likely stealing their grandparents’ accounts. “A lot of kids are living with their grandparents, because their parents are working in the city, so they’re likely to use their grandparents’ account without their knowledge,” says Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM0kfC"&gt;Ahmad thinks the move isn’t likely to be that controversial within China because, while intrusive, the facial checks primarily impact adults, and that online sentiment so far seems fairly predictable. “If you look online and read the comments, a lot of elderly parents say this is great, because gaming is terrible,” he says. “It’s always the older generations that say games are ruining it for our kids, so there’s a bit of acceptance among the older generation in that this is how it should be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal films will head exclusively to Amazon Prime Video after their run on Peacock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Video logo is seen on an android mobile phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/blMHOeyV3QvI2mR_MmSZA8T3RSM=/0x5:5000x3338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563320/1051935276.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WNAmov"&gt;A licensing deal between Universal Filmed Entertainment Group and Amazon will broaden Prime Video’s streaming library and bring anticipated titles to the service after a brief run on Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiMsNX"&gt;As part of a multiyear licensing deal that will begin in 2022, live-action Universal films will head exclusively to Prime Video after their earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565702/universal-dreamworks-peacock-theatrical-releases"&gt;pay-one premieres&lt;/a&gt; on NBCUniversal’s own streaming service Peacock. Per the agreement, Prime Video and Amazon’s free and ad-supported streaming service IMDb TV will both snag a number of new and older Universal titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjahST"&gt;On Prime Video, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The 355&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ambulance&lt;/em&gt; will land on the service after their theatrical releases and earlier exclusive four-month run on Peacock. Amazon’s marquee streaming service will also get some of Universal’s classic titles as part of the deal, including films like &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Love Actually&lt;/em&gt; as well as films from the &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious, Jurassic Park, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Bourne &lt;/em&gt;franchises. &lt;em&gt;Minions: The Rise of Gru&lt;/em&gt; and DreamWorks’s &lt;em&gt;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish &lt;/em&gt;will eventually make their way to Prime Video as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pje5s6"&gt;IMDb TV, meanwhile, will exclusively stream a number of live-action and animated titles from Universal’s library, including &lt;em&gt;The Invisible Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 9&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sing 2&lt;/em&gt;. Animated films arriving on IMDb TV as part of the agreement include&lt;em&gt; Despicable Me 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Shrek 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyoY3C"&gt;The deal arrives as Amazon looks to expand the content offerings for its services, and follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567113/amazon-mgm-deal-chaos-reigns"&gt;proposed acquisition of MGM&lt;/a&gt; to help broaden their respective libraries. But the Universal deal does feel significant in that many of the films debuting on the services are part of beloved franchises, as with the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jurassic&lt;/em&gt; films, signaling Amazon’s commitment to being a formidable player in the streaming wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qUZHF"&gt;In a statement about the licensing agreement with Universal Filmed Entertainment Group and Amazon’s ad-supported service, Lauren Anderson and Ryan Pirozzi, co-heads of content and programming at IMDb TV, called it “another step forward in solidifying IMDb TV’s reputation as a premium free destination for blockbuster movies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Jsagt"&gt;Peacock, which is owned by NBCUniversal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565702/universal-dreamworks-peacock-theatrical-releases"&gt;announced earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that it would become the exclusive streaming home of Universal, DreamWorks, Illumination, and Focus Films movies no later than four months after they debut in theaters. As part of that deal, the films will stream on the service for four months, head to other services, and then eventually land back at Peacock for the last four months of the regular 18-month pay-one window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cFTTx"&gt;In other words, if you do happen to miss&lt;em&gt; Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Minions: The Rise of Gru&lt;/em&gt; in theaters, you’ll be able to find them on one of these services eventually. You just may need to Google which one they’re streaming on, whenever you finally decide to take the plunge. Such is our streaming dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Witcher training is no fun at all in the first trailer for The Witcher season 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F40d8vFRcLR_ePM_w12DLTLw8p0=/58x0:840x521/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563115/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_3.57.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jeb3Rx"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; season 2 has arrived, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;hot on the heels of Netflix’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the show will be returning on December 17th, at the inaugural WitcherCon event. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;And unlike earlier teases&lt;/a&gt;, this one’s a proper, full-length look at the upcoming season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHhyr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild spoilers for The Witcher, season 1 ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Unqrjy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What you've all been waiting for, Witcher family. Here's the first teaser trailer for Season 2, premiering December 17 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WitcherCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TT4yYttA5F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TT4yYttA5F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1413586874342547463?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XDJBu"&gt;Picking up where the first season left off, Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) has finally joined up with the exiled Princess Cirilla. The second season will see the two travel to Kaer Morhen, the mountain fortress of the witchers where Geralt was trained — and where Ciri will be undergoing similar trials to become a witcher herself. And if the teaser is anything to go by, learning to become a witcher is no fun at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQeyA1"&gt;There are also plenty of shots of Cavill dashing through the snow, battling monsters, and brandishing swords at people — all in a day’s work for an itinerant monster-hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="knO6lK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toss a coin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FobhXm"&gt;In addition to the new trailer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;Netflix also teased several other bits&lt;/a&gt; of news for the upcoming season, including a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPL0T3dYlN8"&gt;behind-the-scenes featurette with Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan&lt;/a&gt; on their respective characters Yennefer and Ciri’s storylines in season 2, a look at fan-favorite bard Jaskier’s new maroon wardrobe, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1413554612729257985"&gt;somewhat-cryptic episode titles&lt;/a&gt; for the second season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9OOBm"&gt;Also announced at WitcherCon was a release date for the upcoming animated prequel film, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569957/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-netflix-release-date-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which will come to Netflix August 23rd, and an official announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22567671/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-netflix-dlc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;of a next-generation PS5 and Xbox Series X update&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;CD Projekt Red, which will arrive for free later this year and bring DLC inspired by the Netflix show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gadPWj"&gt;Lastly, Cavill promised that the second season will feature a new song from Jaskier — but we’ll have to wait until the show arrives in December to see if the bard has managed to surpass the meme-worthy “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"&gt;Toss a Coin To Your Witcher&lt;/a&gt;,” or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher 3’s next-gen update will have DLC inspired by the Netflix show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwOBBfgWIasi93W2pXUhEFHtZ2c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562945/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt_Some_creatures_will_be_more_prone_to_inflammation_than_others-The_Igni_sign_works_perfectly_on_the_fiend.0.0.1450729425.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUa5Kn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s&lt;/em&gt; free update optimizing the game for next-generation consoles, which is set to hit later this year, will include DLC “inspired by” the Netflix show, developer CD Projekt Red and Netflix announced at WitcherCon on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFYHGt"&gt;Very little was revealed about what the DLC will look like, but we did get a small tease of what you might be able to expect: “So as an example, you might be able to wear Geralt’s armor inspired by the Netflix series,” Philipp Weber, acting lead quest designer at CD Projekt Red, said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OMjTMybsZvo?t=6035"&gt;during Friday’s WitcherCon stream&lt;/a&gt;. More information &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1413568916920602625"&gt;is coming soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35BQbU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt next-gen update is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this year! Here’s a sneak peek of our updated cover art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spoiler alert: we also prepared some free DLCs inspired by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@witchernetflix&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info coming soon! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hs7LwWzUAt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hs7LwWzUAt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Witcher (@witchergame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1413568916920602625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yjlK0x"&gt;The studio first announced that a next-gen update for PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422690/witcher-3-next-gen-free-upgrade-console-xbox-ps5-pc-ray-tracing"&gt;in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;, promising that it would bring “a range of visual and technical improvements” such as ray tracing and quicker loading times. The update applies to “the base game, both expansions, and all extra content,” CD Projekt Red said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DFjPu"&gt;At WitcherCon, Netflix also announced that the second season of the show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;will debut on December 17th&lt;/a&gt; and that an animated prequel, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf,&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569957/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-netflix-release-date-trailer"&gt;hit the streaming service on August 23rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants in on NFL Sunday Ticket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: JAN 03 Cardinals at Rams" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Owq7vq-V_FDWyTT4iUokJpfv5OQ=/0x107:3400x2374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562937/1230461244.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRhDMy"&gt;In the quest to get people to pay monthly for video, having the rights to stream sports, especially football, is key. Apple might finally be playing that game to spruce up Apple TV Plus: &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-in-early-talks-with-nfl-on-sunday-ticket-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the trillion-dollar phone maker has expressed early interest in securing the rights to the NFL’s Sunday Ticket package — a subscription covering every game that is not airing on local affiliates —  for its video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJRiRn"&gt;The NFL has reportedly not entered into actual negotiations yet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/1413534186208600065?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Sports Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s John Ourand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Apple likely won’t be the only company competing. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; writes that other streaming competitors, like Disney’s ESPN Plus and Amazon’s Prime Video, are likely also trying to secure even more games for their platforms. Currently Sunday Ticket is held by DirecTV, but its contract is up in 2022, which means there's an opportunity to shop around for an even more lucrative deal. DirecTV is also going through its own transition, as AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;spin out the satellite company&lt;/a&gt; and its other non-WarnerMedia video businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVddp6"&gt;Sunday Ticket was actually a condition for AT&amp;amp;T merging with DirecTV in the first place in 2014. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/19/5730854/att-can-bail-on-merger-if-directv-loses-nfl-sunday-ticket"&gt;gave itself an out of its then-$48.5 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; if DirecTV wasn’t able to reach an agreement with the NFL. It ultimately did, but according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, the service has mainly lost DirecTV and AT&amp;amp;T money heading into 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HjvvsK"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said it would “pay net losses” on the Sunday Ticket up to $2.5 billion over the remaining period of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ELAGP2"&gt;There’s good reason to take Apple seriously, even if it’s not ultimately able to secure the bag. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-jim-delorenzo-live-sports-streaming-841a91c7-24d9-4f69-98c9-b60dabb8f1bc.html"&gt;The company poached Jim DeLorenzo&lt;/a&gt;, the former Amazon executive in charge of leading the company’s sports efforts, in 2020. He could be very well be scheduling lunches with NFL bigwigs as I write this, though it’s not clear what a deal would look like with Apple. Amazon has developed a successful relationship with the NFL over the years, gaining exclusive rights to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417957/amazon-nfl-thursday-night-football-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, so maybe the groundwork DeLorenzo laid there will transfer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ58fy"&gt;Either way, the heat is on, and with Apple trying to make TV Plus even more enticing, it's yet another hand trying to exchange money for the most watched sport on US television.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who wins when Amazon pulls brands from its store? </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oInuj1_4coIkNBavVSTTDnNl5_E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562866/akrales_171024_2082_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Not the consumer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="u7KYo5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy a new USB cable, wireless charger, or that fast-charging USB power brick that didn’t come with your new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;$1,000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; (but definitely should have), there’s a typical process many people go through. You open Amazon’s site in a new tab or the app on your phone, type in the thing you’re looking for, scan some review scores, and click Buy It Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byxqkR"&gt;Except now, some of the very best chargers, cables, and wireless pads have disappeared — products that reviewers like us independently recommended and that you could buy at more attractive prices than other brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6Iha"&gt;Today, a search for USB-C or wireless chargers on Amazon will still turn up products from Anker, Apple, and AmazonBasics, as well as many obscure brands with alphabet-soup-style names. But you won’t find options from a bunch of popular brands that were there just a few months ago. Numerous brand lines have been wiped from Amazon’s storefront, leaving fewer, sometimes less-desirable options for consumers looking for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux0r3Q"&gt;It’s a weird situation to be in, given that Amazon has been referred to as “the everything store” for years. (Journalist Brad Stone titled his &lt;a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/brad-stone/the-everything-store/9780316219259/"&gt;first book about the company&lt;/a&gt; exactly that.) And with Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce world and status as the default shopping location for many, bolstered by its Prime service that guarantees fast delivery and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;has over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, it means that the average person buying these things has fewer options than they did just a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucyHWoXNAHzY1hxMZ9wH9C3g4tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026250/aukeybattery.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Aukey USB battery pack. These brands often included things like USB cables with batteries when other brands wouldn’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5GSCo"&gt;Earlier this week, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;pulled Choetech’s products&lt;/a&gt; from its store. That followed the removal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey and Mpow in May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;RavPower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;Vava, and TaoTronics&lt;/a&gt; in June, and likely others that we’re just not aware of. Amazon confirmed that it removed most of these companies’ listings, but it declined to elaborate why. Logical reasoning points to a response to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;reports that these brands were violating Amazon’s rules&lt;/a&gt; by providing incentives for positive reviews. If you’ve ever bought something on Amazon, you’ve probably seen the little cards inserted in the box offering gift cards or refunds if you post a review of the product. (If you have, my colleague Sean Hollister is collecting pictures of them for another story; you can send them to him at sean@theverge.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTwg58"&gt;Gaming the Amazon review system is certainly a problem, and it’s not an activity that I’m condoning. Many shoppers rely on the review scores of products when deciding whether or not to buy something. For smaller, commodity products like cables and chargers, the Amazon review rating is often the only judge of quality you might have before putting your money down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tTgtMu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies Amazon removed sold good, competitive products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNuG77"&gt;Most people would assume that companies engaging in shady activities to promote their products are doing so because the product isn’t any good in the first place. But, in a peculiar twist, that’s not the case with any of the companies I mentioned above. By and large, these companies sold good, competitive products, and put price pressure on other companies making similar devices. RavPower, Aukey, and Choetech make countless versions of the USB chargers, wireless chargers, and cables that are necessary for today’s phones, tablets, and laptops; Vava is known for its line of multiport USB-C hubs; TaoTronics and Mpow sell inexpensive headphones and earbuds that perform surprisingly well for their price. We’ve tested and recommended products from these brands here on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, as have many other publications; I’ve personally purchased numerous products made by them and have had great experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3aIcZ"&gt;These brands differentiated from the rest in a number of ways, including by offering unique designs and port configurations; packing in useful add-ons like a cable with a charger, or a charging brick powerful enough to make a wireless charger work well; or by selling the same effective thing at a lower price. The reasons we specifically called RavPower’s wireless charging pad and stand the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;best ones to buy&lt;/a&gt; were because it performed well, came with the cable and charging brick you needed to use it — a rarity among the field — and was priced better than the competition. I personally bought Choetech chargers because they came with long, high-quality USB-C cables, which you don’t typically get in the box from Anker. A two-pack of compact RavPower 20W USB-C chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/15/22435896/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-android-phone-ebay-4k-tv-tcl-lg-samsung-oled-qled-deal-sale"&gt;cost me less&lt;/a&gt; than a single, bigger one from Apple and less than the similar option available from Anker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ivxf4-BoSiowyWbw-3HH3oR-29g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704521/choetech.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Choetech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A multiport hub from Choetech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z3id4W"&gt;These brands were also around long enough to have established a reputation for quality — I’m more likely to buy a charger from a brand that I’ve got experience with already than to take a flyer on one I’ve never heard of before. These were far from fly-by-night companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmirTw"&gt;Amazon’s removal of these listings is notable because unlike Anker, Belkin, Apple, and other larger brands, you can’t buy products from these companies outside of Amazon or their own websites. They don’t exist in wireless carrier stores or on Best Buy’s or Target’s virtual or in-person shelves. They are, effectively, companies that solely exist because of Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce world. (The exception here is that you now will find these brands sold by third-party sellers through Walmart, which has turned its website into a marketplace, much like Amazon. But you won’t find them at retail stores.) Some of them, like RavPower, were so reliant on Amazon that they sometimes used the retailer as a fulfillment partner for the listings on their own sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="r3Evom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t easily find these brands outside of Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akr54r"&gt;With that much of their business dependent on Amazon shoppers, it makes sense then that these outfits will do whatever they can to succeed on the platform, where an &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-now-dominates-google-in-product-search/531822/"&gt;increasing number of people are searching for products to buy&lt;/a&gt; and bypassing other stores and search engines directly. The companies paying people to post reviews of their products are trying to get more people to see what they have: By getting more positive reviews on their products, these companies will rank higher in Amazon’s search results, which will lead to more sales. A positive star rating on Amazon can make or break the success of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOBEl2"&gt;But instead of examining why these companies are attempting to manipulate its system and making adjustments to its platform to discourage this activity, Amazon has taken a heavy-handed whack-a-mole approach to just banning those that get caught breaking its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td45hF"&gt;Amazon doesn’t seem to be interested in changing the incentives on its platform, preferring to just remove sellers it deems to be bad actors. In its &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2SYAL6T"&gt;June blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company pointed blame at social media companies for not better policing groups that collaborate to game the Amazon reviews system, and boasted that it reported over 1,000 groups in just the first three months of 2021. The company’s position is that this is how it protects shoppers from getting scammed or having a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQBhAh"&gt;But as long as sellers on Amazon are incentivized and rewarded for high star ratings and positive customer reviews on their products, there are going to be those that use tactics that Amazon doesn’t like, and come off as less than scrupulous to those buying the products. Those companies are more likely going to be smaller outfits that don’t have other retail channels or brand recognition to fall back on — even if their product is good enough to stand on its own. That is the reality of the system that Amazon has built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTpznR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So long as review scores impact how visible a product is on Amazon, sellers will try to game the system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iYazoQ"&gt;An even more cynical take on this is that Amazon is just going to supplant these retailers’ products with more of its own AmazonBasics-branded gear. The company has been caught in the past using data from what’s popular on its store to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;inform its AmazonBasics product roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon could be in the process of rolling out lower-priced versions of what Anker and Belkin are selling with its name on it, taking the place of the RavPowers and Choetechs that used to be there. I’m not convinced that this is what’s happening here, but in the service of teasing out all possibilities, there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1zZTM"&gt;I also don’t have a handy answer for how Amazon could fix this, nor is it really my job to find a solution for one of the richest companies on the planet. Authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22443153/amazon-seller-supsensions-aukey-mpow-ftc-paid-fake-reviews"&gt;both the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550171/uk-antitrust-watchdog-investigating-amazon-google-fake-reviews"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; have started putting pressure on Amazon to fix its fake review problem, but the tactics the company has taken so far seem to lay all the blame on the sellers bending the rules, not evaluating the flaws inherent in the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DFOjJr"&gt;At the end of the day, Amazon’s policies and platform, while ostensibly protecting shoppers from fraud, end up giving consumers less choice than they would otherwise have. Until the company fixes its platform, shoppers are going to be the ones left holding the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw1trF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBLh3M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is coming to Netflix in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJq1BeXa5mLZoMOmwx9zi4b51KM=/0x501:1500x1501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562605/E54CqchWQAc5I42.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mn5bMI"&gt;The fantasy world of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is going to expand later this summer. At WitcherCon — a new event dedicated to, obviously, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; — Netflix announced that the animated prequel &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; will debut on August 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0atuRZ"&gt;The show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;which was originally announced last year&lt;/a&gt;, is being handled by Korean studio Mir — best-known for its work on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; — with &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich serving as a producer. The anime movie takes place before the events of the show, following Geralt’s mentor Vesemir. You can get a sense of the world and setting in the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoEbKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; debuted on Netflix at the end of 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21042869/netflix-witcher-top-10-adam-sandler-murder-mystery-stranger-things-6-underground"&gt;almost immediately became a huge hit&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the streaming service has set about turning it into a franchise; in addition to &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;a second season of the main show coming in December&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;a live-action spinoff starring Michelle Yeoh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A sealed copy of The Legend of Zelda just sold for nearly a million dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CxLePdCPteFxRU8KuXo3_1qWprs=/0x33:1796x1230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562358/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_10.32.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdjUAl"&gt;A sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for the NES just sold for &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/the-legend-of-zelda-wata-90-a-sealed-no-rev-a-round-soq-early-production-nes-nintendo-1987-usa/a/7261-28030.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"&gt;$870,000 at Heritage Auctions&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the previous record for the most expensive game ever sold (as far as I am aware, at least). That record was just raised quite a bit in April when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; was auctioned for $660,000&lt;/a&gt;, a price that more than quadrupled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;previous known record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwpMI1"&gt;As for why this version of the game is so valuable? I’m just going to leave part of Heritage Auctions’ grandiose explanation here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bnIeuM"&gt;While it is a hard truth, it is a truth nonetheless — none of the copies we’ve offered of this title previously could even attempt to hold a candle to this one due to its incredibly rare variant that holds early production status. This matter is completely inarguable. This is the only copy from one of the earliest production runs that we’ve ever had the opportunity to offer, and, possibly will have the opportunity to offer, for many years to come. Considering this variant was only produced for a few months in late 1987 before it was ultimately replaced by the “Rev-A” variant in early 1988, this statement likely comes as no surprise to collectors. Only one other variant precedes the offered “NES R” variant and that is the “NES TM” variant, which is the true first production run. However, it is also widely believed that only a single sealed “NES TM” example exists, and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market. Essentially, this copy is the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0n4a"&gt;All sorts of collectibles have taken on significantly increased value as of late. Many Pokémon cards &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/pokemon-cards-worth-a-fortune-to-collectors-and-startups-alike"&gt;are now worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;, and card grading companies are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22413108/pokemon-trading-card-collectors-overwhelm-grading-collecting-rating"&gt;drowning in Pokémon cards&lt;/a&gt;. NFTs had a hot minute there where they could sell for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;eye-poppingly huge amounts of money&lt;/a&gt;, though prices &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/nft-price-crash-what-next-for-digital-collectibles.html"&gt;appear to have fallen in recent weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4BIad"&gt;Now the question for me is: which video game will be the first to sell for more than a million?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>News Corp gives up on its ‘Knewz’ aggregator after 18 months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8WGyB_ueImawzpl9cnlVwV20B24=/0x9:1846x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562314/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_8.36.31_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: News Corp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNDhz3"&gt;Knewz, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828592/knewz-news-corp-news-distribution-app-facebook-google"&gt;the news aggregation site created by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to gain some leverage against Google and Facebook’s control over what articles users read, is dead. The website, curated by a mix of artificial intelligence and real breathing editors, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewKeysLive/status/1413494562853588996?s=20"&gt;lasted just 18 months&lt;/a&gt; before shutting down, presumably because News Corp began to get concessions from both Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSzdjp"&gt;The garishly yellow front page of Knewz is gone, but you can still see &lt;a href="https://knewz.com"&gt;its farewell message&lt;/a&gt; (and a plug for other News Corp sites). According to Knewz, it had provenance, “but not profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCY-ZtqCZxkJ_uQRJ4F_kELfBvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708338/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_8.25.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knewz’ trusted news sources are News Corp entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Byq6SE"&gt;Knewz tried to bill itself as a publisher-friendly aggregator, pulling from sources big and small across the political spectrum. If it had &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-corp-readies-news-app-to-address-publishers-concerns-about-google-and-facebook-11566497094?shareToken=stad0a5e159ac74cb28ac16c16c55e79b1"&gt;worked as promised&lt;/a&gt;, it would’ve favored original reporting over quick news aggregation, shared data with publishers, and skipped taking a cut of ad revenue. The problem was no one was reading the news through Knewz, and &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/knewz-murdoch-promotion-tool-coronavirus.php"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the site frequently defaulted to News Corp sources over other publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWAZVw"&gt;The timing for a Knewz shutdown makes sense, even if it seems to shatter the illusion that News Corp was doing this for anyone other than itself. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;a law supported by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; — on News Corp’s home turf — platforms like Google and Facebook are forced to pay, and negotiate with, news publishers to display their stories. This initially did not go down well with either platform (Google threatened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;to pull its search engine from Australia&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately both &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332658/facebook-news-corp-rupert-murdoch-deal-australia-sky-news"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; ended up striking deals with News Corp. You don’t need a weird and blunt tool like Knewz when you can just get Australian regulators to force people to pay you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US sanctions a Chinese facial recognition company with Silicon Valley funding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hitachi Kokusai Electric Surveillance System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4rb9pGNANzOTx34x7DZawQq_iI=/54x0:587x355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562257/Hitachi_Kokusai_Electric_surveillance_system_640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4koWkl"&gt;The US Department of Commerce has &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-14656.pdf"&gt;sanctioned&lt;/a&gt; 14 Chinese tech companies over links to human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, including one backed by a top Silicon Valley investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6431e"&gt;DeepGlint, also known as Beijing Geling Shentong Information Technology Co., Ltd., is a facial recognition company with deep ties to Chinese police surveillance, and funding from US-based Sequoia Capital. Today the Commerce Department added it to its &lt;a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list"&gt;Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts US companies from doing business with listed firms without a special license. Sequoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idm9Gv"&gt;DeepGlint co-founded a facial recognition lab in 2018 with Chinese authorities in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3008998/deepglint-chinese-ai-firm-helped-police-catch-criminal-who-had-been"&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt;. It has also gained &lt;a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/new-algorithm-pushes-into-biometric-accuracy-leaders-in-latest-nist-frvt"&gt;international bragging rights&lt;/a&gt; through the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Face Recognition Vendor Test. DeepGlint claimed top accuracy in the test as of January 2021, giving it a &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-u-s-rubber-stamps-facial-recognition-systems-used-to-round-up-uighurs-in-china-595478547f86"&gt;potent marketing tool&lt;/a&gt; in the security and surveillance industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cmbBgb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bill Gates also referred to the startup as “very cool” in 2014&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnAXZc"&gt;While DeepGlint has been accepted for a public offering on Shanghai’s STAR stock exchange, the firm hasn’t seen the commercial success of other AI startups in the country, explained Jeffrey Ding in his &lt;a href="https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-147-a-deepglint-in-the-eyes"&gt;ChinAI newsletter&lt;/a&gt; last month. Since the firm is so heavily invested in government work, it has to follow slow government procurement cycles and is unlikely to score huge infrastructure projects, Ding writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhSV8W"&gt;Sequoia Capital has funded another company that later ended up on the Entity List. In 2020, Sequoia-backed Yitu Technology was &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-u-s-rubber-stamps-facial-recognition-systems-used-to-round-up-uighurs-in-china-595478547f86"&gt;added to the list&lt;/a&gt; for similar human rights abuses. Sequoia invested in DeepGlint back in 2014, before China’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037"&gt;genocide of Uyghurs&lt;/a&gt; had come to light. (The same year, Bill Gates also referred to the startup as “very cool,” according to &lt;a href="https://kr-asia.com/deepglint-once-a-promising-chinese-ai-pioneer-is-currently-struggling-to-regain-its-glory"&gt;KrAsia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ur7oI7"&gt;The Commerce Department also sanctioned Xinjiang Lianhai Chuangzhi Company and &lt;a href="http://www.xwsesa.com/Aboutus/index/id/7/type/English"&gt;Chengdu Xiwu Security System Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, two subsidiaries of Chinese military contractors. They both offer surveillance equipment and services, according to their websites and academic reports. Xinjiang Lianhai Chuangzhi Company created an AI-powered checkpoint system that is able to track Uyghurs as they move around cities, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ispionline.it/en/pubblicazione/how-china-uses-artificial-intelligence-control-society-23244"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Italian Institute for International Political Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hp9atD"&gt;Another firm sanctioned today is Leon Technology, a surveillance company that was controlled by Chinese AI giant SenseTime until its role &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii"&gt;providing oppressive technology in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; was reported in 2019. SenseTime then divested its 51 percent stake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSysy"&gt;The Commerce Department sanctions also included nine other Chinese companies for national security reasons, as well as companies in Iran, Russia, and Canada, among other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
