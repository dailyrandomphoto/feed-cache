    <title>Apple TV app now available on the latest Google Chromecast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zVOSMThHUPqFqBdRZwA3O_niMzg=/0x0:1569x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837077/Blog_header.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rB2lJ"&gt;The Apple TV app is now available for Google’s 2020 Chromecast. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178364/google-chromecast-apple-tv-plus-app-2021-announcement"&gt;announced in December&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s streaming app, which offers access to its Apple TV Plus originals, would be coming to the awkwardly named Chromecast with Google TV. Starting today, owners of the excellent $50 device can download Apple TV and start using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlwBpL"&gt;Apple TV originals like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; will appear in Google TV’s recommendations and search results. Of note, you’ll also be able to add Apple’s original shows and movies to Google TV’s universal Watchlist. Some bigger streaming services like Netflix have decided against participating in Watchlist in the months since the Chromecast’s release, as they seemingly prefer to keep that sort of functionality inside the app itself. As &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/25/google-tv-netflix-dropped/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in November, the Google TV mobile app doesn’t even include Netflix recommendations anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wU5zHi"&gt;Apple TV is also getting Google Assistant integration on Chromecast; you can start watching any of Apple’s originals with a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQPyiZ"&gt;In addition to being home to Apple’s original programming, the Apple TV app offers easy streaming of your movie / TV show rentals and purchases from Apple. And as on other platforms, any Apple TV Channel add-on subscriptions you might have — CBS All Access, Showtime, etc. — will be available in the app on Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO61r8"&gt;Jonathan Zepp, Google’s director of media and entertainment, says that “in addition to Chromecast with Google TV, the Apple TV app will also be available on Google TVs from Sony and TCL.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is restructuring its AI teams after Timnit Gebru’s firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PP_s8tIngc2zcoYyW-9kWnm0lmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836952/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTWl5H"&gt;Google is reorganizing its responsible AI teams in the wake of Timnit Gebru’s firing. The ethical AI team will now roll up to Marian Croak, a prominent Black executive in the engineering department. Croak will also oversee employees focused on engineering fairness products, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/google-to-reorganize-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She will report to Jeff Dean, who leads the company’s AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVNJ61"&gt;The ethical AI team was not aware of the reorganization until news broke Wednesday night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awxVBm"&gt;The change is an attempt to stabilize the department, which has been in turmoil for months, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/google-to-reorganize-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In December, Timnit Gebru, co-lead of the ethical AI team, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;announced she’d been abruptly fired&lt;/a&gt;. The following month, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html"&gt;the company began investigating her counterpart Margaret Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, who had been using a script to go through her emails to look for examples of discrimination against Gebru. Mitchell now says she’s been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1361415627781459971"&gt;locked out of her corporate accounts for more than five weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDmFav"&gt;Prior to her dismissal, Gebru had been trying to publish a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;paper on the dangers of large language processing models&lt;/a&gt;. Megan Kacholia, vice president of Google Research, asked her to retract the paper. Gebru pushed back, saying the company needed to be more transparent about the publication process. Shortly afterward, she was fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXXe5K"&gt;The ethical AI team &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/googles-ai-ethics-team-makes-demands-of-executives-to-rebuild-trust.html"&gt;published a six-page letter&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of Gebru’s termination, calling on Kacholia to be replaced. “We have lost confidence in Megan Kacholia and we call for her to be removed from our reporting chain,” the letter read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn4hfa"&gt;Now, the team may be getting its wish. As part of the reorganization, Kacholia will no longer lead the ethical AI researchers, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;It’s not clear what this means for Margaret Mitchell, who is still being investigated by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOgQxU"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwInYh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panasonic made a farting cat robot!</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fu3fJ9ZLBrI6OGo5srVFy0QcDjs=/122x12:1318x809/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836879/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_11.04.55_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sVuxBa"&gt;I am so tired, and there are so many things happening. Days like today have become the norm over this last, lost year; there is a tragedy happening every second of every day, and if you’re lucky enough to be outside of the blast radius you’re only able to perceive what’s happening through a screen. Just last night, Texas Senator Ted Cruz decided to take a family trip to Cancún as large swaths of his state are without power or potable drinking water in the midst of a historic deep freeze. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1362418963196485634"&gt;He’s now on his way back&lt;/a&gt;, after being shamed online for his bafflingly cruel choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyipGx"&gt;That was the first thing I saw this morning. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/resisting-the-urge-to-pet-panasonics-farting-robot-sock-1846252962"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; was the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K0Pwzr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DsYUo6hios?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oS11la"&gt;This funky little robot’s name is Nicobo, and it was created by Panasonic for companionship.  It’s loosely catlike; it farts. It cannot do more than wiggle its head and its tail and blink its unnervingly digital eyes. It can sort of talk. And no, if you’re interested, you cannot buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpgbGG"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/resisting-the-urge-to-pet-panasonics-farting-robot-sock-1846252962"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Panasonic is only planning to make a few hundred Nicobo units; it made them available for preorder via its own crowdfunding platform, and they have all been claimed as of six hours after the campaign launch. (Nicobo costs about $360.) If you managed to get your hands on one, you’re expected to pay around $10 a month to get things like software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7Jqte"&gt;I am not sure why I’m telling you this. It’s not like you can buy this robot, which is cute in its way. It’s also not like learning about a small Japanese robot will change your life or even fend off existential despair for more than the time it takes you to get to this paragraph in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y3xqv"&gt;Perhaps there’s a lesson here, nestled between the juxtaposition of the logic of production and the reality of widespread human suffering. Nicobo was created by Panasonic in partnership with robotics researchers from Toyohashi University of Technology as a companion — as a technological salve for atomization, capitalist alienation, and good old-fashioned loneliness. After a year of drastically less human touch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051662/robot-cat-headless-yukai-engineering-petit-qoobo-ces-2020"&gt;we’ve yet another robotic Band-Aid&lt;/a&gt; for a gaping psychic wound. I guess it’s cuter than a Zoom call?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mortal Kombat’s first trailer is almost as violent as the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YO28mbjHDgk9tHNwcIwSIp6syEk=/265x0:1819x1036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836770/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_11.10.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2BA4Jb"&gt;The rebooted &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie has debuted its first trailer — and, much like the games it’s based on, the upcoming film looks to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; violent. (Warner Bros. has actually released two trailers, with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J983DiVbZ9k&amp;amp;has_verified=1"&gt;a more gory red-band version&lt;/a&gt; available on YouTube.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Js26W8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; stars Lewis Tan as an MMA fighter Cole Young, who seems remarkably blasé about the suspiciously dragon-shaped scar on his chest (he assumes it’s just a birthmark, which certainly strains credulity.) But Cole is quickly recruited to fight in a legendary tournament — the titular “Mortal Kombat” — with the fate of Earth in his hands. (Literally. There’s going to be a lot of fighting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tvjr6J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mortal Kombat 11 is a game nearly 30 years in the making","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512337/mortal-kombat-11-ps4-xbox-switch-ed-boon-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QwmuZQ"&gt;The trailer also gives the first good look at the latest live-action versions of Sonya, Kano, Raiden, Jax, Liu Kang, Shang Tsung, and Kung Lao, along with the dueling supernatural warriors Sub-Zero and Scorpion (the video game’s unofficial mascots). The new film is set to be a rebooted attempt to adapt the hyper-violent fighting game after the original&lt;em&gt; Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; films from the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWLIZt"&gt;Like all of Warner Bros.’ 2021 blockbusters, Mortal Kombat will be released in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously on April 16th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) review: just get a 4K model</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s latest 1080p streamer is faster and runs improved software, but it feels out of place in a 4K world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Hxcopq"&gt;Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick is a $39.99 streaming dongle that’s aimed at people who haven’t yet made the upgrade to a 4K TV — and don’t intend to anytime soon. It maxes out at 1080p video resolution, but offers support for modern tricks like HDR and Dolby Atmos surround sound. That’s a weird zone to be in when rival products like the Chromecast with Google TV go all-in on 4K for not much more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt9uXA"&gt;Even &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which works just fine with older TVs, is only 10 bucks more at $49.99. So the Fire TV Stick (and cheaper Fire TV Stick Lite) are really only recommended if you’re positive your HDTV isn’t going anywhere for a few years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YLZ3pa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10349131"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ERm3"&gt;If that’s your situation, you’re definitely getting a more powerful streamer than before. Amazon says the new Fire TV Stick is 50 percent faster than the previous version — but it looks identical on the outside. It’s still a matte black stick that plugs into one of your TV’s HDMI ports. You attach a Micro USB cable to it for power, toss some batteries in the Alexa voice remote, and you’re off and running. This is the same full-fledged remote that comes with Amazon’s pricier streaming devices, so in addition to playback and navigation controls, you get some extra buttons (power and volume) for controlling your TV with it. The Fire TV Stick Lite’s remote doesn’t include those. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msXfvPfcTX0TQoeWTxnffKUCPlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312194/DSCF3060_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick’s remote has buttons for controlling your TV power and volume.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dAEyQk"&gt;The improved performance is noticeable. Amazon’s older Fire TV Stick could sometimes get hung up or slow down when scrolling around or opening apps, but I rarely encountered anything of the sort with this new model. It feels on par with the more premium 4K-capable Fire TV products in terms of speed. Voice searches with the Alexa remote were similarly quick, whether I was searching for a certain show or asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOMYiW"&gt;Expect mixed results when it comes to HDR and Dolby Atmos support. In my tests, Prime Video and Disney Plus did a good job getting the most out of the Fire TV Stick’s video and audio specs and regularly delivered both HDR and Atmos, but you’ll find that not all services will serve those with a 1080p stream. Both HDR10 and HDR10+ are supported by the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite, but Dolby Vision is not. Video frame rates of up to 60fps are supported now, compared to the 30fps ceiling on the prior hardware. That’s a nice upgrade for sports and watching video game streams on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bekj-F8A_Pl3VPg22BM1UdmEE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312192/DSCF3051_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick plugs directly into any available HDMI port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LogF6J"&gt;Amazon’s app selection is excellent, though there is one notable omission: NBCUniversal’s Peacock service still hasn’t been made available on the platform. Everything else, including Apple TV Plus, HBO Max, and other apps, can easily be downloaded. When you set up the Fire TV Stick, Amazon suggests a number of streaming apps to install right off the bat, though the list doesn’t include all the popular favorites. (Everything is easily downloadable after the fact.) Getting the remote configured with your TV’s volume and power controls is also a snap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3ukzd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new Fire TV experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca3bQC"&gt;Perhaps more interesting than the new hardware is the overhauled software experience that’s first debuting on the Fire TV stick before arriving on the company’s other devices. Aside from cleaning up and simplifying the main menu navigation — there are now just four tabs to choose between, in addition to your favorite apps — it also introduces multiuser profiles. You can create up to six profiles, and it’s possible to designate them as kid profiles that are limited to age-appropriate streaming content. Each user gets their own personalized viewing history, recommendations, watch list, and live TV preferences. As for apps, you can choose which six apps appear on the main menu and easily get to your others with a click. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CxIiR7GioGfskRkRhLem1r0q5T8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312146/hometab3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Fire TV experience still has ads that have nothing to do with streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMYpWP"&gt;The Library tab is where you’ll find your purchases, rentals, and watch list. Home is essentially the same as before, giving heavy preference to all things Prime Video (and IMDb TV, which Amazon also owns). The order of rows will dynamically adjust based on your viewing habit, but not to the point where it makes things confusing: your “up next” and recent apps stay up near the top. With the new Find tab, you can dig deeper into dedicated areas for movies, TV, genres, or other categories like “free,” which highlights ad-sponsored streaming channels. (This section is also now where the app store is found.) The last tab is for live TV, which integrates with services like Hulu, Sling TV, and YouTube TV to show a traditional channel guide on-screen where you can quickly access live programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boKxDPhu3K5Nb4db0_gp8T_ytM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312150/kidsprofile.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new profiles feature lets you create a locked-down account for children in your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjwJFV0l-ym9Xbjgcoom5wcWRbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312152/profiles.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Up to six profiles can be made on each Fire TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dp0tMC"&gt;But the main frustration of the new Fire TV software remains the same as it was before: there’s an over-abundance of sponsored content. Within a few clicks down on the home tab, I saw a full-width ad banner for Honda trucks and SUVs. And as you progress down the carousels of content, it becomes clear that many of them are sponsored. These are a few I saw as I moved down the Home tab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="X5QMNc"&gt;Pluto TV — free movies and TV shows — sponsored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mc2FrG"&gt;Sponsored: Prime Video Cinema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2F7Zyx"&gt;Sponsored: This week on Fire TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nl1vBp"&gt;Sponsored: Apps and games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7lkwK8aaecDYUEnYpRwypvk3eI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312148/ww1984.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s content still gets pushed heavily across the software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QWG4yK"&gt;This spon-con is interwoven with genuinely useful rows like “movies we think you’ll like” and “top-rated TV shows,” so it’s not egregious or enough to ruin the overall experience. You could also argue that Amazon is just being more transparent and obvious with its sponsored sections, versus competitors who might mix them in alongside general algorithm recommendations. But it still leaves you with the feeling that there’s a lot of advertising real estate for sale throughout the Fire TV experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KbuW1"&gt;The new Find tab does a better job than the Home tab at aggregating TV shows and films from your various subscriptions — not unlike what Google tries to accomplish with its Google TV software. Amazon was one of the first to push the idea of prioritizing content over a more app-centric layout (like what’s on a Roku or Apple TV), but in some ways Google has already pulled ahead. On Fire TV, it’s never clear which service you’ll be watching content through until you click into a title. Google does a better job making clear what’s coming from where right on the main menu. But to Amazon’s credit, there are helpful filters for things like “free to me” and “rent or buy” to help you whittle down the selection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VEqfza_XvIQ5KXxCJ_czCrNdQ3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312149/find.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The all-new Find tab makes it quick to find content that’s free to watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oae6zG"&gt;When you’re browsing around, this new Fire TV experience all feels very familiar. Amazon might have switched up the home screen, but on the whole, this isn’t a drastic makeover. I like how on the title page for any show or movie, it’s very quick and convenient to scroll through other things that the cast has appeared in. And you still get the handy “more ways to watch” to see where else you can stream something, with existing subscriptions and ad-sponsored services given preference above paid options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeJSeN"&gt;But some areas of the interface still need refinement. For example, I got a notification that said “some content is provided by Verizon” with a disclaimer that the company might collect viewing data — with no indication of which app the notification was actually for. I assume it was for one of the live news services, but there was no confirmation that it was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="vSGqmb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10349148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33qgB3"&gt;The new Fire TV experience will come to other products in March. It’s definitely an improvement over what was there before, and the profile options will prove useful for parents and people with shared living spaces. It’s available first on the Fire TV Stick, but I don’t think that’s reason enough to get Amazon’s $40 player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9WKDlo"&gt;I’m sure Amazon has all the data in the world to show that this product makes sense, but buying a 1080p streaming device in 2021 seems ill-advised. This feels like something Amazon should just be giving away to Prime subscribers as a freebie. You’d be much better off in terms of future-proofing by spending extra — not much extra, really — for the Fire TV Stick 4K if you constantly stream from Prime Video and will put the remote’s Alexa capabilities to use. If you’re not big on Amazon’s ecosystem, then something like the new Chromecast or a Roku streamer would be a more sensible buy. The latest Fire TV Stick is faster than before and comes with sleeker software, but it’s still not cut out for a 4K streaming world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind indie adventure Minit returns with a side-scrolling racing game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5xwkSzY9y1sCUXOIud6vVx3QrY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835872/minit_funracer_x4_7.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Devolver Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qj2xHF"&gt;The indie gem &lt;em&gt;Minit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/7/17207310/minit-indie-game-review-die-every-60-seconds-love-letter-classic-gaming"&gt;released back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, felt like a breath of fresh air. The monochromatic adventure game took a seemingly absurd time constraint — killing the player every 60 seconds — and turned it into both a passionate love letter to top-down classics like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda &lt;/em&gt;and an ingenious and clever quest that threw constant surprises at the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xteSAm"&gt;Now, the core team behind &lt;em&gt;Minit — Nuclear Throne &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Disc Room &lt;/em&gt;developer Jan Willem Nijman, designer Kitty Calis, composer Jukio Kallio, and artist Dominik Johann&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;are back with a new spinoff title, &lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer. &lt;/em&gt;The game takes the same core idea and applies it to a side-scrolling biking game reminiscent of arcade titles of decades past. All proceeds of the game, which is being published for free by indie label Devolver Digital, go to charity, including Doctors Without Borders and Special Effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="631uEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer &lt;/em&gt;releases today for $2.99 on both Steam and itch.io, with the latter store having a pay-what-you-want option for those who’d like to give more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnOMa1wQKt9duVxTPS5oVSAbJsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310133/minit_funracer_x4_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro6mr5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer &lt;/em&gt;has less of a narrative than the game it’s based on and an even tighter time constraint of less than 10 seconds to begin with. You’re simply plopped down onto a highway full of obstacles and challenged to find your way to the end before the timer runs out and you start over from the beginning. But &lt;em&gt;Minit Fun Racer &lt;/em&gt;lives up to the original by hiding scores of secrets to find through experimentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFkz3i"&gt;The main engine of progress in the game is earning coins and using the currency to unlock new upgrades, which, in turn, help you progress further along the route. But there are Easter eggs and fun little side quest-style unlockables — like an air horn for waking up the sleeping cats by the side of the road or an impromptu helicopter chase if you bump two cop cars — that make the game worth exploring in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nwtxi8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our philosophy has always been if you have fun making something it really shines through in the final product.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qx6v5a"&gt;“We wanted to make a full game, not just something you would buy just for charity,” says Calis. “The bigger it gets, the more we can help, and in the end we want people to have a good time and to do good, too.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1hFmt"&gt;In my first few play sessions last week with a preview build of the game, I died — a lot, as is expected. But after my first few upgrades, I felt like I was making steady progress and really enjoying the fast-paced, trial-and-error design. And the new music from Kallio, a longtime collaborator of Nijman’s who also co-wrote the catchy &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;is a fantastic addition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vL6pOo"&gt;“Our philosophy has always been if you have fun making something it really shines through in the final product,” Nijman says. Asked about other &lt;em&gt;Minit &lt;/em&gt;spinoffs or sequels in the future, Nijman and Calis say they aren’t yet ruling out future works — or as Nijman called it, a “Minit cinematic universe” — using the game’s pixel art style or its core time constraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VROxgK"&gt;“Never say never,” Calis says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXVBVH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook employee warned it used ‘deeply wrong’ ad metrics to boost revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6AZUJ_HqFqLAgHdFy7VY69pvGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836532/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qybpvh"&gt;Some Facebook employees believed they were promoting “deeply wrong” data about how many users advertisers could reach, and one warned that the company had counted on “revenue we should have never made” based on its inflated numbers, according to recently unsealed internal emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2vsJZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c144b3e0-a502-440b-8565-53a4ce5470a5"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the statements today based on a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.330648/gov.uscourts.cand.330648.257.0.pdf"&gt;newly unredacted filing&lt;/a&gt; from a 2018 lawsuit in California. The lawsuit claims that Facebook knowingly overestimated its “potential reach” metric for advertisers, largely by failing to correct for fake and duplicate accounts. The filing states that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged problems with the metric in 2017, and product manager Yaron Fidler proposed a fix that would correct the numbers. But the company allegedly refused to make the changes, arguing that it would produce a “significant” impact on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTjooI"&gt;“It’s revenue we should have never made given the fact it’s based on wrong data,” Fidler responded in an email. Another employee added that “the status quo in ad reach estimation and reporting is deeply wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVFaRb"&gt;Facebook has argued that the “potential reach” metric is only a free tool that doesn’t directly reflect how much a campaign will cost or who it will reach. However, the suit cites an internal Facebook statement calling potential reach “arguably the single most important number in our ads creation interfaces” since advertisers relied on it to design ad strategies and budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZ7MQL"&gt;Facebook told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; that the latest “allegations are without merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMrNrk"&gt;It’s not the first time Facebook has been accused of hurting businesses by inflating its numbers. The company previously faced a suit that claimed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit"&gt;greatly and knowingly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; how much video users were watching — an error critics say pushed online media publications toward &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html"&gt;a doomed “pivot to video” strategy&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in layoffs and enervated newsrooms. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-reaches-proposed-settlement-in-video-measurement-lawsuit-11570482031"&gt;settled that suit&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA is set for its most daring attempt to land on Mars in a search for ancient life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHmeI_59U9lyL60dONEW6CUG3IU=/460x0:5523x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836252/05_GuidedEntry_10k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration showing NASA’s Perseverance rover making its way toward the Martian surface.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9ex47"&gt;On February 18th, NASA will make a daring attempt to land a car-sized rover on Mars in its most complex mission yet to hunt for ancient extraterrestrial life. If it survives the plunge through the Red Planet’s atmosphere, the Perseverance rover will kick off the first leg of a grand relay race to capture humanity’s first cache of pristine Martian soil samples, among many other scientific objectives it hopes to score along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ghJ60n"&gt;What time will NASA’s Perseverance rover land on Mars?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BHILAe"&gt;Having traveled 293 million miles since its launch in July last year, the rover is now gearing up to execute the Solar System’s most grueling parking job ever. At around 3:48PM ET, Perseverance will begin its wicked seven-minute descent toward the Martian surface, hitting the planet’s atmosphere at speeds of roughly 12,100 miles per hour before being calmly deposited in a messy jungle of cliffs, massive boulders, and dangerously sandy pits at Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWTu9Pk0PWDD4oZj1qfkdOu9hqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310629/09_Touchdown_10k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This illustration shows NASA’s Perseverance rover and its descent stage executing a “skycrane” maneuver for a safe touchdown at Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yL2U7H"&gt;In that fully autonomous landing sequence, the spacecraft carrying Perseverance will endure blazing heat, ditch its protective shell, and deploy a set of parachutes. As it approaches the surface, the spacecraft’s descent stage will fire onboard thrusters to slow itself down to a sedate 2 mph and hover some 66 feet above the surface. Then comes the “skycrane” technique: the descent stage, still firing its six mini rocket thrusters, will gently lower Perseverance on cables the rest of the way to the surface. Once the rover touches down, it’ll snip its cables, prompting the descent stage to take off, eventually landing far away from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tMJC2D"&gt;How to watch Perseverance’s “seven minutes of terror”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UPgGzT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21X5lGlDOfg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgU7Qd"&gt;To virtually join engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as they track Perseverance’s plunge into Mars, the agency will have &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;live streams&lt;/a&gt; of NASA coverage and video and audio of mission control beginning at 2:15PM ET. Actual footage of the spacecraft’s landing will take about a week to beam back to Earth, but it’ll be worth the wait. Perseverance has 19 on-board cameras, and its landing gear has four, promising views of parachute deployment and other steps of its rapid descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrGtQK"&gt;If the landing choreography goes as planned, NASA would become the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266752/uae-china-nasa-mars-missions"&gt;third spacefaring power&lt;/a&gt; this month to reach Mars after the United Arab Emirates and China. NASA has said some of the rover’s onboard instruments, like a tool that will try to convert Martian carbon dioxide to oxygen, are being tested to inform future astronaut missions to Mars under the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700565/nasa-artemis-moon-return-landing-trump-administration-jim-bridenstine"&gt;Artemis program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pKEeFD"&gt;A high-stakes landing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8LdeS5"&gt;Dozens of mission engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California have spent years planning, troubleshooting, mapping, and stressing over the seven-minute landing sequence. “Everything’s come down to that,” Al Chen, NASA’s entry, descent, and landing lead, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He calls his team of about 30 engineers working this week “glorified delivery guys.” But with a $2.7 billion rover, the stakes are much higher than your average drone-delivered Amazon package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T52RZr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have this big 200-foot cliff wall going right through the middle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="71UwTg"&gt;“We know that the rest of the mission, the surface mission and everything that comes afterward and the rest of the campaign, is depending on us. So we wanna make sure we don’t let anybody down,” Chen said. Making it even more nerve-wracking, an 11-minute communications delay between Mars and Earth means Perseverance will have to carry out its descent and landing all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1iSFO"&gt;Comparatively, NASA’s past Mars rovers had it easy. They also had to endure the infamous “seven minutes of terror,” but they got easier landing zones. NASA’s Opportunity rover was greeted by a flat, wide-open desert of the Martian Eagle Crater when it touched down in 2004. The Spirit rover’s Gusev Crater landing site and Curiosity’s site at the Gale Crater were similarly flat, dotted only with small rocks. A wholly different extraterrestrial landscape awaits Perseverance at the Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient river delta believed to bear traces of past life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxWXLv"&gt;“We have this big 200-foot cliff wall going right through the middle” of the crater, Chen said. “There are a bunch of craters around the site that are full of sand, that even if we landed there it wouldn’t be safe to drive out of. And there are rocks in a lot of different places that we definitely don’t want to come down on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPZ9sL"&gt;What will Perseverance do on Mars?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BBHGKP"&gt;Why would NASA pick such a difficult region to land in? It’s “because the geology on Jezero crater is so exceptionally well-preserved,” said Briony Horgan, a scientist at Purdue University working on Mars Perseverance. Jezero’s 28-mile-wide diameter could be a goldmine for fossilized microorganisms, and its mix of different rock formations offers researchers a smorgasbord of potential samples. What’s more, scientists believe Jezero hosted a river delta about 3.5 billion years ago, preserving organic matter in muds long after it dried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FAKPJO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tomorrow I arrive at Jezero Crater, a dry lakebed on Mars. I’ll chart a path along its ancient shoreline, to see if it’s like similar places on Earth. I’m looking for rocks that tell a story of past microbial life. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5RCEWdNc9b"&gt;https://t.co/5RCEWdNc9b&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsNJjXHPbu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsNJjXHPbu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1362137708294934529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wr6gnz"&gt;“We think, based on looking at orbital data of the delta, that those muds that could contain signs of organic materials and life are actually preserved at the base of the delta at the cliffs,” Horgan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M25bER"&gt;This is key for Perseverance’s primary mission: packing about 43 soil samples in cigar-sized tubes and depositing them across 5–10 different sites at Jezero. Those tubes will sit on the surface for years until a future “fetch” mission planned jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency arrives for pickup. That mission’s turn in the relay race will come in the late 2020s, when a fleet of four spacecraft and robots will work in concert to land on Mars, gather the sample tubes, and shoot a soccer ball-sized sample canister back into space for a journey home to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iow54L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All that wild science and engineering hinges on a successful landing on Thursday&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzV4kU"&gt;Perseverance’s secondary objectives include a mini-helicopter named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21339544/nasa-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-perseverance-rover-flight-date"&gt;Ingenuity&lt;/a&gt;. Detaching from the rover’s belly, the $85 million craft will attempt to fly in Mars’ ultrathin atmosphere up to five times during a month-long window that will begin a month or two after Perseverance lands. Using helicopter blades to traverse a planet with a much thinner atmosphere than Earth’s requires extra power and speed for the craft’s four-foot-wide propellers. If the flight demo succeeds as engineers hope, it would mark the first demonstration of vertical rotorcraft on another world and could unlock access to more volatile extraterrestrial regions that are too rough or slippery for more traditional grounded rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHYWJsVuFPjLPrzF_KUN22_6gkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312172/Helicopter_landing_composite.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration showing NASA’s little Ingenuity helicopter carrying out its flight demonstration above the surface of Mars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t314Xk"&gt;Ingenuity, while weighing about as much as a half-gallon of milk, will have solar panels for power, its own communications hardware, and two cameras (one to record Martian landscapes during flight and another to help with navigation). Perseverance is also decked out with 19 cameras plus a few microphones that promise high-def audio of Martian wind. For engineers, the audio-visuals provide a means to monitor the rover’s instruments and make sure everything looks and sounds normal. A so-called SuperCam sticking out of the top of the rover — basically looking like Perseverance’s robot head — will fixate on Martian rocks, zap them with a laser beam, and analyze the cloud of vapor produced as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oq48s7"&gt;Locating “tiny parking lots” on Mars &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FUtKCV"&gt;All that wild science and engineering hinges on a successful landing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc5mVj"&gt;Perseverance has 4.8 miles of cushion for its landing zone. For a mission millions of miles away to Mars, 4.8 miles is a tiny bull’s-eye, one that’s 10 times smaller than the flat surface the Curiosity rover landed on in 2012, and 300 times smaller than that of NASA’s first Mars rover, Sojourner, in 1997. Such tactical precision is made possible by two pieces of tech the other rovers didn’t have: a “Range Trigger” that will accurately shoot out Perseverance’s parachutes when it decelerates to 940mph during its descent, and an enhanced navigation system that links up with a Mars orbiter to calculate exactly where in Jezero the rover will land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvsQow"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just need tiny little parking lots that are interspersed that we can reach”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1efC"&gt;“It’s kinda like what people used to use in the car, looking out the car window and seeing what you see and then trying to figure out where you are by looking at your map,” Chen said. “We no longer need the entire [landing zone] to be a flat and boring parking lot of a runway, we just need tiny little parking lots that are interspersed that we can reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx3YIk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWlowr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJe252"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OEZGp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Oj3O3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feyIIw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElFHKG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2mchg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyLIp9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost your Nintendo Switch’s storage with this $70 512GB microSD card</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jX35Yz"&gt;It’s a good thing that Nintendo’s Switch supports microSD because prices for the expandable storage format just keep getting better. Today, for instance, you can buy PNY’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KD4XJLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB microSD card at Amazon for just $70&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a Deal of the Day, so this price will expire later tonight. Previously, it was rare to find this amount of storage for less than $100, and with each Switch game being between 5-15GB in size, this will serve you a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yQcIQx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1F2Y7F"&gt;Also at Amazon, you’ll find the lowest price yet offered on Apple’s most recent Mac mini with the M1 processor. It’s the base model with 256GB of storage, which is admittedly not much, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you’ll pay $600&lt;/a&gt; at checkout instead of $670. This price drop beats all other retailers, but the catch is that Amazon says people who buy one right now at this price won’t get one until late March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mFkRkP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orDn7a"&gt;I mentioned recently that Google’s Nest Audio smart speaker is $20 off its usual $100 price. If you’re in the market for two of them, you can save a little more than that per speaker ($25 off) &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/996990/1036?subId1=VergeNintendoSwitchStorage021821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga01420us2.html"&gt;at Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. Add this two-pack of speakers to your cart, then insert the coupon code &lt;strong&gt;50OFF199 &lt;/strong&gt;to get both for $150 altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="euoXO5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZtYv9r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Scientists try to fix flat maps with new double-sided projections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFncByLgV0o8ppaew0Cg3-DyIr4=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68836121/equidistant_azimuthal_projection.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A double-sided projection to show off our 3D planet in 2D.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gott, Goldberg, Vanderbei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D23gK2"&gt;A trio of scientists have devised a new way to try to represent our spherical planet as a flat picture with a new class of projection that involves printing the map as a double-sided circle, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-02-astrophysicists-re-imagine-world-distorted-radically.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phys.org &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Double-Sided Gott projections involve splitting a globe in two and printing the separate hemispheres on separate sides. The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2102/2102.08176.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; is the work of J. Richard Gott, Robert Vanderbei, and David Goldberg from Princeton and Drexel universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZVqiy"&gt;While 3D globes are the most accurate way of representing the layout of the Earth’s surface, it’s much more convenient to refer to a 2D representation. There are a variety of ways of converting this 3D shape into 2D, which are referred to as map projections, but none of them are perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xAelb3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We believe it is the most accurate flat map of Earth yet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9Jd28"&gt;The most famous projection is probably the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection"&gt;Mercator projection&lt;/a&gt; (which is used by Google Maps for local area maps), but it gets really distorted near the North and South poles. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection"&gt;Winkel Tripel&lt;/a&gt; is another option, and it’s the one used by National Geographic for its world maps, but it still splits the Pacific Ocean in two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNjszX"&gt;In 2007, Goldberg and Gott devised a system for scoring the accuracy of flat maps, where the closer a score is to zero, the more accurate it is. A globe, for instance, would get a perfect zero. By their calculations, the Mercator projection scores 8.296 and Winkel Tripel does better at 4.563. Their own azimuthal equidistant double-sided projection, meanwhile, scores 0.881. “We believe it is the most accurate flat map of Earth yet,” the trio write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGwncZ"&gt;It might technically be flat, but having a map printed on two sides of a piece of paper introduces obvious limitations. The scientists admit that “our double-sided flat map is actually more like the globe of the Earth than the other flat maps” because you can’t see both sides at once. Instead, they see it as the kind of map that might be included as an extra sheet in a magazine, or printed on cardboard or plastic and stored in boxes.  &lt;/p&gt;
