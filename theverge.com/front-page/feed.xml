    <title>Not just RavPower — Amazon has yanked Vava and TaoTronics, too</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4NML2c"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/cheap-consumer-devices-amazon.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profiled Sunvalley&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese electronics manufacturer that obsessively monitored Amazon to build and maintain US-facing brands with a reputation for quality. They include phone charging specialist RavPower, home office and dash cam supplier Vava, and headphones and home appliance purveyor TaoTronics. Now, all three of them have disappeared from Amazon, seemingly for ignoring the platform’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqNFle"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;Amazon confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it had removed RavPower. (Amazon tells us it’s checking on Sunvalley’s other brands). But it’s clear from their empty Amazon storefronts that something’s going on — and the Chinese company has already issued a statement, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405535690188681224"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Ngyuen&lt;/a&gt;, confirming that Amazon suspended them on June 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ee6c4k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RAVPower's parent company has issued a statement saying that three of its brands (incl. Taotronics and VAVA) were suspended from Amz yesterday, affecting 31% of the company's revenue, and it will rely on its DTC site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stock is down 12% today.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/6hKeLiyvgm"&gt;https://t.co/6hKeLiyvgm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405535690188681224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4wxEtp"&gt;When Nguyen bought a new charger from RavPower, &lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb?amp=1"&gt;she received an offer&lt;/a&gt; for a $35 gift card in exchange for an Amazon review. That kind of manipulation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;has been against Amazon’s rules&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, and Sunvalley’s statement suggests that’s also the reason why these brands were suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFijCM"&gt;Still, there’s something weird about the situation. Sunvalley’s brands stood out among the throngs of fly-by-night electronics vendors on Amazon with their word-jumble names&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Also, the products were often good!&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;RavPower made our favorite wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;, and we recommended the Vava Laser TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21453070/best-projector-home-theater"&gt;as “the projector with the best image quality&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt; called a Vava hub &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-hubs-and-docks/"&gt;the best USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt;, and we recommended a HooToo USB-C hub &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iCSO9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HooToo, Anjou, and USpicy are still kicking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye7aLN"&gt;Interestingly, Amazon hasn’t yet removed HooToo, a fourth Sunvalley brand — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hootoo&amp;amp;i=electronics&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;it still has at least three USB-C hubs on sale&lt;/a&gt;. Another brand, USpicy, seems to still be selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/USpicy-Professional-Essential-Cosmetics-Foundation/dp/B00UJ0P4PM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a pack of makeup brushes&lt;/a&gt;, and aromatherapy brand Anjou &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1E8713AD-4E1A-48E4-A931-27FD1017FC11?ingress=0&amp;amp;visitId=8f895c56-e4cd-41eb-a460-7630697a5fb9"&gt;still has a line of essential oil diffusers&lt;/a&gt;, bath bombs, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHKXPm"&gt;Sunvalley said in the statement that Amazon counts for 31 percent of its revenue, which is a lot, but the impact may not stop there. Some of the company’s products have also been fulfilled by Amazon, even if you were to buy them at a website like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fravpower.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538779%2Famazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ravpower.com&lt;/a&gt;, for example. When I tried to purchase a RavPower charger yesterday, I received an email saying that my order couldn’t be completed. It’s possible that they just sold out, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozg5Q0"&gt;RavPower didn’t respond to a request for comment, and I spent about 10 minutes on hold with Sunvalley US before being told they’d get back to me sometime in the next two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBZv9Q"&gt;Something that may or may not be relevant: Allen Fung, Sunvalley US’s longtime general manager, who takes credit for building these brands and running the Amazon business over the past ten years, left the company in January 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-fung-8b7b725/"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awRb8j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo will build its electric vehicles at a new Oklahoma factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MQK3M7M8arhmrCTC3yopeWlsyk=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468287/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior__24_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNe41H"&gt;California EV startup Canoo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/61/milestone-met-canoo-selects-oklahoma-for-owned"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that it plans to build its electric vehicles at a new factory to be built outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The startup claims the facility will create “more than 2,000 jobs” and that it will open in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2zmAk"&gt;The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant, according to Canoo, which is calling the facility a “mega microfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0tWlg"&gt;But since Canoo wants to put its first vehicle — an electric van first announced in 2019 — into production by the end of 2022, it will have the first units built by a contract manufacturer in the Netherlands called VDL Nedcar. Canoo says VDL Nedcar will build “up to 1,000 vehicles” for both the US and European markets in 2022 and is targeting 15,000 vehicles in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlMtiI"&gt;Canoo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;went public at the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt; and raised around $600 million in the process, also plans to build an electric delivery vehicle that is adaptable for other small business use cases, as well as an electric pickup truck. All three vehicles are built on the same compact platform, which houses the battery pack, the motors, and pretty much all of the electronics. While a number of automakers and suppliers are developing EV platforms, Canoo’s compact packaging drew interest from Hyundai and Apple — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;a deal with Hyundai is now dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;talks with Apple broke down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMIABt"&gt;Tony Aquila, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;took over as CEO of Canoo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement that the startup ran a “multi-state competition and invested millions of dollars to find the right manufacturing facility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4OG69w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pUazVU"&gt;Oklahoma — and the city of Tulsa, in particular — waged a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;massive, meme-filled campaign&lt;/a&gt; to try to convince Tesla to build its Cybertruck factory there in 2020, though it ultimately lost out to Austin, Texas. The state “literally threw everything on the table” to woo Tesla, including trying to match the $1.3 billion incentive package that the Silicon Valley automaker landed for its original Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rsyQM"&gt;While Oklahoma lost the fight for Tesla’s business, many of the people involved in that solicitation process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that they believed being in the running was worth it just to get on the radar of other automakers. On Thursday, officials from the state said that effort had paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5TEaq"&gt;“We have made electric vehicle manufacturing a top priority in our recruitment efforts as we work to further diversify Oklahoma’s economy,” Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Workforce Development Scott Mueller said in a statement. “Governor Stitt and I were able to work closely with Tony and his team over the last several months and showed the entire Canoo team the many merits of doing business in Oklahoma, including the value of the collaborative effort between great leaders like Tony and the senior leadership of our state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrWdXY"&gt;During an investor event in Texas on Thursday, Aquila said that the total incentive package is “over $300 million.” The state of Oklahoma may kick in “millions more” based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility. “It’s a pretty good deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JePyzC"&gt;The governor’s office confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Canoo will receive some funds through the state’s Quick Action Closing Fund incentive program, but did not specify an amount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juiced HyperScrambler 2 review: speed demon</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is it an e-bike or an e-moped? Who cares, it’s fast&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="o10qt9"&gt;The Juiced HyperScrambler 2 is a lot of bike for a surprisingly affordable price. The classic mini-bike-meets-moped design is very popular among e-bike companies right now, with dozens of smaller brands trying to cash in on the trend. But Juiced is one of the first to do it, and do it well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfSrV8"&gt;With the HyperScrambler 2, the SoCal company went all in on speed and power. The dual-battery setup ensures hours of riding without fear of getting stranded miles from home without any juice. (Sorry.) The only question is whether your butt can actually endure so many hours of riding in this particular saddle. (Mine could not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OBvfOs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Super73 v Juiced: Racing two extremely powerful e-bikes|102100" data-volume-uuid="9621959b1" data-volume-id="102100" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-767" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81o9ep"&gt;When I say this is a lot of bike, I’m not exaggerating. At a whopping 119 pounds, the HyperScrambler 2 is one of the heaviest e-bikes I’ve ever tested. That’s mostly thanks to those twin 52-volt / 19.2 amp-hour batteries strapped to the middle of the frame. That weight can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on what kind of riding style you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0X2dBF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10611829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8x2SZ"&gt;The HyperScrambler’s girth certainly gives it a more commanding stance on the pavement, which can help improve riding confidence. On the other hand, this is not a bike meant for carrying up and down stairs or even throwing in the back of a truck or SUV — at least not without the risk of a herniated disc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGJUB"&gt;But forget all of that for a moment: I have a lot of e-bikes in my garage right now, but every time I’ve had friends over in recent months, there was only one they wanted to try out for themselves. The Juiced HyperScrambler 2’s ostentatious design and powerful motor practically begs to be ridden — and ridden fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2mt8nWr0hNhSxybS5qwLg6oIJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665030/DSC_0035.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The large, round headlamp and elongated saddle give this bike its classic mini-bike feel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4YBdKP"&gt;Juiced is a Southern California company, as if that wasn’t obvious. Founded in 2009 by Tora Harris, a Princeton graduate and former Olympic high-jumper, the company originally was focused on importing lithium-Ion batteries before pivoting to e-bikes. A year later, Juiced launched its first bike, the low-step &lt;a href="http://juicedriders.squarespace.com/odk/"&gt;ODK utility bike&lt;/a&gt; (which kind of looked like a precursor to the RadRunner by Rad Power Bikes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw5kTQ"&gt;Juiced now sells 10 models under four distinct categories: the Rip-Current fat tire bikes; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20875870/juiced-scorpion-ebike-price-specs-release"&gt;moped-style Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;; the Scrambler minibikes; and Cross-Current for urban commuting. The company has earned consistent praise for its ultra-fast, moped-lite bikes. &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a33313406/best-fat-tire-ebikes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bicycling&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; named the HyperScorpion one of its best fat tire e-bikes of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QY4vOe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can confirm the “insane” range on this bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CW5Yux"&gt;The HyperScrambler 2 was unveiled in September 2020. (The original HyperScrambler, which came out in 2019, suffered from controller issues and wasn’t widely distributed.) &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/juiced-unveils-truly-insane-2kw-and-30-mph-hyperscrambler-2-electric-bike/"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Harris called the bike’s range “truly insane” and said the HyperScrambler 2 was the “perfect mobility solution for a broad range of riders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqGApa"&gt;I can confirm the “insane” range on this bike, but is it the perfect mobility solution? Not exactly. There’s no question that there’s a lot to like about this bike, but there are also some serious trade-offs that need to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/djvkF-97X86fQg3EQ2JacJ9WMEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664763/DSC00230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alix Diaconis&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The HyperScrambler 2 is extremely heavy, not exactly affordable, but very fun to ride. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aG0DpG"&gt;First, let’s talk about the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jUzaVW"&gt;Motor: Bafang RetroBlade rear hub (1,000W continuous power and 2,000W peak power)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2bLcsp"&gt;Top speed: 30-plus mph (48.2 km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Cpqk7M"&gt;Range: 33-100 miles (55-166 km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oQxKQo"&gt;Battery: Twin 52V 19.2Ah (998 Wh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MV7vEv"&gt;Weight: 119 lbs (53.9 kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNgUzl"&gt;Brakes: Tektro HD-E350 Hydraulic Disc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPPgZd"&gt;Tires: 20-inch Innova&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WymQkl"&gt;Headlamp: 2,000 lumen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6M7y6v"&gt;Extras: Front and rear suspension; sideview mirrors; USB charger; turn signals, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TCTX74"&gt;Price: $2,699&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xWpMlM"&gt;It may not be the most high-performance e-bike on the market — the Super73 RX proved to have a little more pick-me-up than the HyperScrambler 2 in a side-by-side test — but it provides more than its fair share of white-knuckled, dumb grin-producing experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z21PWn"&gt;Juiced offers five different versions of the HyperScrambler 2: three pedal-assist models and two throttle speed models. I tested the highest spec version, the throttle-based Race Track Mode with a top speed of 30-plus mph. With a twist of the throttle, the bike rocketed up to a top speed of 32mph — just fast enough to make my palms sweaty. The noise from the motor was tolerable, though it wasn’t nearly as silent as most of the Bosch-powered bikes I’ve ridden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8OAHFJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a twist of the throttle, the bike rocketed up to a top speed of 32mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PM7Jvu"&gt;I did experience some problems with the HyperScrambler’s throttle. Occasionally, the motor would stay engaged even without pedaling or using the throttle, which created some awkward moments. Squeezing the brake would turn it off, but releasing the brake would cause the bike’s motor to turn back on without twisting the throttle. These are the kinds of wiring problems that your local bike shop probably isn’t equipped to repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v0p3N"&gt;If I was thinking about buying this bike, I might be concerned about longtime service and repair issues. When things break down — and they inevitably will — it’s going to be more of a hassle to get these bikes fixed than your average 10-speed. Juiced has a &lt;a href="https://www.juicedbikes.com/pages/warranty"&gt;fairly extensive warranty&lt;/a&gt;, but it only applies to new bike purchases. If you buy the HyperScrambler used, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZodI7g"&gt;The two-foot-long (62-centimeter) padded seat is where the HyperScrambler gets most of its classic mini-bike looks, but I really wish Juiced had gone with something more adjustable and more comfortable. For short rides, the seat proved to be no problem; but for those longer trips, my butt was a little worse for wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lWPFd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Juiced claims you can get up to 100 miles of range on a single charge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2aOc"&gt;Juiced claims you can get up to 100 miles of range on a single charge, but that’s only riding in the lowest possible setting. In my experience, very few people will ride a bike this way. But with the dual-battery configuration, the HyperScrambler 2 has 1,989 watt-hours, which is just an incredible amount of battery capacity. Juiced has a balancer module that automatically draws power evenly from the two batteries. And you have the option to simply turn one battery off if you only want to drain one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HisNYj"&gt;The dual batteries really did wonders for my range anxiety. I test a lot of e-bikes, and I’ve been stuck miles from home with a dead battery more times than I can count. It’s not fun. But the HyperScrambler 2 is one of the longest-range bikes I’ve ever ridden. If you’re gunning it all the time at 30mph (and, real talk: you will be; it is so friggin’ fun), you are going to get about 20–25 miles per battery, so about 50 miles total. And riding in a more laid-back style will get you even further.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The dual batteries will do wonders for your range anxiety. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HFYggf"&gt;The components on the HyperScrambler 2 are really, well, very busy. In addition to the 8-gear shifter, there’s a USB plug, turn signals (!), an extremely loud (and annoying) horn, and an LCD display, where you can toggle between power settings. The sideview mirrors and turn signals were a nice touch and certainly improved my riding experience. They were also a good reminder that the HyperScrambler is really pushing the common definition of what many would consider an electric bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm3g7n"&gt;I think the main question you need to ask yourself before buying this bike is: what kind of riding do you plan on doing? If you’re looking for an e-bike that can replace a car, with some room for cargo or even a kid seat, this is not the bike for you. But if you’re looking for a bike that can go wicked fast, impress your friends with a uniquely classic design, and won’t break the bank (but may break your head — always wear a helmet!), then this should definitely fall under your consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="G1rVEg"&gt;This is a vibes bike, the kind you take out on a warm summer night when the sun is low over the horizon, you have some cash in your pocket, and the good taco truck is just down the street. It’s for boardwalk cruising, gravel grousing, and definitely anywhere there’s a flat stretch of pavement and no cars. Just twist that throttle, and let it rip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three big questions about Facebook’s new VR ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Advertisement within the Oculus Quest game Blaston." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LidtzYoDzFoXNYwZZ_eISywXrCY=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468003/image001.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HcvxhP"&gt;Yesterday, Facebook took a leap many people have been predicting for years: it started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;putting ads inside virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;. The company launched a limited test of advertisements inside three Oculus Quest apps, saying it would expand the system based on user feedback. The move is a turning point for Oculus, bringing one of Facebook’s most controversial features into a medium that inspires both idealism and alarm. And it raises three big questions about Facebook’s future and immersive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfQqaZ"&gt;The first question is how deeply Facebook will end up linking advertising with hardware sensor data. Even more than smartphones, Oculus Quest headsets are a &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/23/virtual-reality-allows-the-most-detailed-intimate-digital-surveillance-yet/"&gt;gold mine of information&lt;/a&gt; about you. They capture precise head and hand motion, pictures of your surroundings through tracking cameras, and microphone audio for Facebook’s voice command system. Future headsets will likely include even more intimate features like eye tracking, which would offer incredibly precise metrics on what captures your attention in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMTzRB"&gt;Right now, Facebook says much of this data either never leaves your headset or is completely segmented from its advertising system, and it says it has “no plans” to do things like target ads based on movement data. But as Facebook moves deeper into virtual and augmented reality, using its hardware’s special features for advertising will become an increasingly attractive prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eTL6um"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Immersive computing is a gold mine of intimate data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Myuua1"&gt;Facebook is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;working on a fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; and has discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418353/facebook-reality-labs-vr-ar-glasses-audio-experiment-perceptional-superpowers"&gt;building AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll use to interact with the world. These products are custom-built to produce quantifiable insights about your body and surroundings, and it’s hard to believe Facebook doesn’t have plans to monetize that — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22221251/facebook-reality-labs-boz-andrew-bosworth-interview-privacy-moderation-horizon-ar-vr"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth&lt;/a&gt; has said the company is “not really focused on business model” questions for experimental hardware. Oculus is Facebook’s first big test case for advertising on its own computing device, and as it expands ads on VR and other hardware, we’ll see how it handles the wealth of new data types it’s collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHoC1e"&gt;The second question is how ads will affect VR development. Several of the bestselling VR titles right now feel like substantive console or PC games and sell at a similar price. By contrast, it’s not yet clear which app genres work well with an ad-based model. (&lt;em&gt;Blaston&lt;/em&gt;, the first game we know includes ads, is a &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/blaston-impression-vr-dueling-bullet-hell/"&gt;multiplayer dueling game&lt;/a&gt; that you play in short competitive bouts.) Whatever those genres are, Facebook just created an incentive to make a lot more of them, since developers get a cut of the revenue involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BPnKF"&gt;It’s easy to imagine dystopian scenarios like a huge library of attention-grabbing but low-quality games and social apps plastered with pop-ups, or the seizure-inducing corporate hellscape &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpPE85Jogjw"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t help that Facebook’s first tests look like flat banner ads from a website or freeware game. That said, Facebook is notoriously picky about what goes into the Quest library and there’s no indication that will change soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZxyts"&gt;We also don’t know VR advertising’s final form. Facebook says it’s currently exploring “new ad formats that are unique to VR.” It didn’t specify what that looked like, but for one nontraditional ad platform, we could look at &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — a popular virtual world from a studio with an impeccable gaming pedigree, and one of the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/23/18635920/fortnite-jumpman-john-wick-marvel-brand-advertisement"&gt;most effective ad delivery systems&lt;/a&gt; in the modern cultural landscape. (A system where players pay to promote the intellectual property of multinational media conglomerates is possibly also dystopian, but in a way most people seem okay with.) Modern consumer VR headsets have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/14/11214484/mcdonalds-vr-htc-vive-sxsw-2016-capitalist-dystopia"&gt;full of ads&lt;/a&gt; since practically the beginning, thanks to promotional tie-ins and sponsorships. Yesterday’s news was just the latest iteration of a long-running trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PQ8Rox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does a good ad-supported VR app look like?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CR1WqU"&gt;This iteration, though, has a big Facebook-shaped wrinkle. The Quest ads are served based on data from your Facebook profile, and Facebook’s hyper-personalization is one of its most controversial features — criticized in general as a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/technology/campaigns-pressure-facebook-political-ads.html"&gt;tool for social division&lt;/a&gt; and more specifically for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403025/facebook-discriminatory-ads-housing-job-credit-hud"&gt;enabling discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond any larger social effects, if you’re sharing a headset with friends and family, it could feel simply invasive to have them see what Facebook thinks you’re into. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289577/facebook-rolling-out-multi-user-support-oculus-quest-2"&gt;add multiple accounts&lt;/a&gt; to a Quest headset, but the feature is experimental and it’s not clear how many users know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tReLQE"&gt;And that raises the third question: how will Facebook and its critics address general concerns about “Big Tech” in the realm of VR? Should Facebook, for example, ban specific kinds of ads — or methods of ad delivery — from appearing in headsets? And should consumer protection watchdogs look specifically at how ads work inside the Oculus platform, which they’ve largely ignored when scrutinizing Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aizaPY"&gt;It wasn’t hard to see these debates coming. Facebook has wanted to own the next computing platform for years, and its vision of computing relies a lot on advertising. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey once promised that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1405248117830602756"&gt;Oculus wouldn’t&lt;/a&gt; “flash ads at you” inside VR, but he (along with Oculus’ other early executives) left the company years ago. Bosworth &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/the-oculus-rift-will-be-ad-free-so-long-as-developers-want-it-that-way/"&gt;said in 2015&lt;/a&gt; that the Oculus experience “should include ads, because life includes ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXEPOy"&gt;But Facebook says it’s not just barreling ahead with a long-held master plan — instead, it promises it’s looking at feedback as it moves forward with VR advertising. As VR gets closer to Facebook’s core business, Quest users and developers will get to see if the company keeps that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab returns for Xbox Series X custom controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06FGi3cDUdKmmV4vE64ZHCVeVA4=/156x0:1277x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467839/xboxdesignlab.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LzpRjC"&gt;Microsoft is bringing its Xbox Design Lab back for Xbox Series X controllers. Originally launched in 2016, Xbox Design Lab allows Xbox owners to create personalized Xbox controllers. Microsoft is bringing the program back for the next-gen Xbox Series X controllers, after putting it on hold just ahead of the Series X launch last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiBeAC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Custom controllers will be available&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, and most European countries today, priced at $69.99 with millions of color combinations. Just like before, you can customize colors in pretty much every part of the controller, including bumpers, thumb sticks, the D-pad, and options for buttons. Engraving is also available for an extra $9.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU9rEq"&gt;All new Xbox Design Lab controllers will be based on the Xbox Series X / S controllers, which have fairly minor tweaks over the original Xbox One controller. Microsoft has reshaped its latest controllers to fit a “wider range of people,” and the latest Xbox controller also includes a redesigned D-pad and a dedicated share button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBmOuP"&gt;Unfortunately, you still can’t create a custom Xbox Elite controller. Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available today here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the 2021 fire season in the West</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COCHISE STRONGHOLD, ARIZONA - APRIL 18: A recent forest fire burned out a campground, April 18, 2021, in the Dragoon Mountains of Eastern Arizona.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk7cnJvGrhWWu7oufi_coSQ_Q7U=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467755/1316479844.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The stage is set for a bad season, but there are still a lot of unknowns&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iMhCtD"&gt;After a horrific 2020 fire season, the 2021 season is heating up. Ominous signs popped up early this year: a worsening drought and early heatwaves. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with fire, weather, and climate experts to break down what to expect throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocAsQ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How bad is 2021’s fire season going to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lumn6B"&gt;The stage is already set for a pretty bad fire season. Up to 9.5 million acres could burn this year, according to a fire season &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/accuweather-2021-us-wildfire-season-forecast/939026"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; from AccuWeather. That’s 140 percent of the 10-year average. It’s not as much as last year, when more than 10 million acres were scorched. That was the second worst year for fires in the US, in terms of acres burned, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf"&gt;since 1960&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVl8OE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUqbv"&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West at some point this year, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. A “significant fire” is one that grows so large that locals usually need to call in help from outside the region, according to Nick Nauslar, a fire meteorologist at the Bureau of Land Management. The blaze might span thousands of acres and require hundreds or thousands of personnel to battle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA6HY9"&gt;But predicting just how bad things will get is still a tough question, so it’s best to break it down into two parts that could influence how this fire season unfolds: known risk factors and wildcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grp25T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so what are the risk factors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tqr2CX"&gt;A major risk factor is drought. The Western US is in the middle of the most widespread and intense drought in decades. More than &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;83 percent of the West is in a drought&lt;/a&gt;; about half is experiencing “extreme” or “exceptional drought.” In fact, the water level at the Hoover Dam reservoir, the largest in the US, hit a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYxAVD"&gt;“This is currently the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US,” says Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. “When we see droughts like this, it really amplifies the fire season.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-ENVIRONMENT-DROUGHT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/byP8ub4kys1FdVTC7i7LPcTSNeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665088/1233384349.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Bridget Bennett / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A growing pale high-water mark known as a “bathtub ring” is seen on the shoreline of Lake Mead at the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 10th, 2021, where the water level has fallen to its lowest since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LbpCpG"&gt;Plants are parched, making them excellent fuel for wildfires. Spring was so hot and dry in California that San Jose State University researchers were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FireWeatherLab/status/1378184587315085313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1378184587315085313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F04%2F15%2Fweather%2Fcalifornia-wildfire-season-forecast%2Findex.html"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; in April to find no new growth of the Chamise plant, which they track to monitor moisture content in vegetation. Now, the plants are drying out faster than they normally do, with their moisture content just shy of reaching a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXKQOq"&gt;The lower the moisture content, the easier it is for vegetation to catch fire. In that situation, “If somebody drops a match or cigarette, you know, we’re hosed,” says Craig Clements, a professor and director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San Jose State University. Moisture content is closely tied to a fire’s spread rate, or how fast the blaze moves forward. So when that fuel is critically dry, Clements says, fires can get much bigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2A3VHZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the wildcards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqIj6a"&gt;The biggest wildcard is the weather. As of June 1st, there had been fewer acres burned this year than the 10-year average. That’s mostly because there hadn’t been “critical fire weather patterns,” which can be different combinations of high temperatures, strong winds, aridity, and lightning. In 2020, California got an unusual combination of lots of lightning with little rain. That sparked some of the state’s worst blazes, which were fanned by strong gales. California wound up doubling its record for acres burned that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ewj5z7QEP7Gldv_NyBQa9GTO-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867291/PANO0003-3.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearby wildfires blanketed San Francisco with smoke and turned skies orange during the 2020 fire season. Verge video director Vjeran Pavic took these pictures of San Francisco and Sutro Tower using a drone on September 9th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFtNSm"&gt;“If we transported us back to early to mid-June 2020, we probably have more potential this year than we did last year,” says Nauslar. “The potential is there, but now it’s a matter of if the weather will line up to realize that potential or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9edXHk"&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors. Do they take extra precautions? Or might they plan an elaborate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html"&gt;baby gender reveal that sparks a blaze&lt;/a&gt;? “As a resident in a high fire hazard area myself, and as someone who understands how quickly these fires can grow and put people in harm’s way, I definitely look at this upcoming season and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to be vigilant,” says Crystal Kolden, a former firefighter who is now an assistant professor of fire science at the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced. “We just have to keep reminding people that if there aren’t any human ignitions, then we don’t have any really big fires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7iWXdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u83uWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’s fire season going so far? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eSuswY"&gt;A scorching heatwave and high winds this week have fed what’s become the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/558859-one-of-arizonas-largest-wildfires-in-history"&gt;sixth-largest &lt;/a&gt;fire in Arizona’s history. Officials listed the cause of the Telegraph Fire burning outside of Phoenix as “&lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7512/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;,” but the cause is still under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xaqw4G"&gt;Most Western states have already had at least one significant fire this year, according to AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter. “So the season has run ahead of usual, if you will, in that regard,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TcTCr"&gt;Bad weather is starting to make things worse. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;temperature records fell&lt;/a&gt; this week during a sweltering spring heatwave. Salt Lake City, Utah, reached a record &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSaltLakeCity/status/1404949205588742146"&gt;107 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit on June 15th. The temperature in Billings, Montana, climbed up to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBillings/status/1405040165760868352"&gt;108 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit that day, tying its record. And Texas residents face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;power shortages&lt;/a&gt; as they sweat out the heatwave, just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456856/deaths-undercount-texas-freeze-power-outage"&gt;deadly blackouts&lt;/a&gt; during a freak cold snap earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nNIchI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does fire season last? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DmkXSh"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445539/2021-atlantic-hurricane-season-noaa-forecast"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, the fire season in the Western US doesn’t start and end on the same day every year. Unofficially, it’s been thought of as beginning in late spring and lasting through early fall, roughly May to November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz11WZ"&gt;The season hits its peak at different times in different regions. The Southwest typically sees peak fire potential earlier in the season, and then areas further north and west follow. Part of that has to do with what type of vegetation, or fuel, is in each region. Grass tends to dry out faster and then burn earlier. California’s shrubby chaparral takes a little longer to dry out and forests even longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4N735e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10611720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzsoBq"&gt;Fire season is growing longer, &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2315/study-fire-seasons-getting-longer-more-frequent/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows, thanks to changing rainfall and snowmelt patterns. Fire season has lengthened by 75 agonizing days across the Sierras, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqHr5G"&gt;“[Fire season] used to kind of have a better definition,” Nauslar says. “But now I think we’ve been more talking about ‘fire year.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xHTAjw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1weCgl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is climate change playing a role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBC6p1"&gt;The “season” is expected to keep growing longer and more intense as the planet heats up.  That’s because climate change is exacerbating many of the risk factors that drive wildfires. Heatwaves are getting more frequent and intense. Typical droughts are becoming megadroughts. Lightning strikes &lt;a href="https://environmentjournal.online/articles/the-future-is-not-forecast-how-lightning-is-affected-by-climate-change/"&gt;could even become more common&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/6/"&gt;By 2060&lt;/a&gt;, the amount of land lit up by lightning-ignited fires could be 130 percent of what it was in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JQUuo3"&gt;“Part of me looks at the upcoming season and says, you know, climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us, every single year,” Kolden says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzAXKi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 will be available through Sony’s store later today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xS5CiNMvEijE7WtcR5T9S8X8bM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467646/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ww7DNc"&gt;More than six months after its initial debut, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; remains as elusive as ever. Sony also expects console shortages to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;stretch into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, however, as of 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT, both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition will be available at Sony’s store. &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=hsm0u2oyux&amp;amp;ver=v3-javascript-3.6.3&amp;amp;cver=281&amp;amp;man=PS%20Direct%20Prod%20KU%20Action&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fhardware%2Fps5&amp;amp;kupver=akamai-1.0.2"&gt;You can head to that site right now&lt;/a&gt;, and the page will automatically toss you into the queue to (hopefully) secure a PS5 from the batch being released into the wild today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcPHQX"&gt;Sony says that you don’t need to refresh the page, but make sure that you stick around once the queue begins because it’ll likely ask you at some point to verify that you’re still present, or else you might be booted from the queue. If it’s your first time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;welcome to the needless drama involved with buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpQBa"&gt;So, what’s the difference between the two models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA6hbH"&gt;The standard PS5 ($499.99) and the Digital Edition ($399.99) are nearly identical, aside from the obvious. The standard console features a UHD Blu-ray disc drive whereas the latter does not, meaning you’ll need to download or stream anything you want to watch or play. The Digital Edition also features a slimmer, lighter build because of this, however, keep in that the size difference is slight. Both consoles also sport an 825GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F29IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBTYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to purchase a PS5, there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories we suggest you pick up&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and the best PS5 exclusive released thus far: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Returnal-PlayStation-5/dp/B08QFPS48J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AasZjK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JTGN3h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nefQI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;In addition to the accessories above, we also recommend buying an &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gives you access to online multiplayer, a selection of free monthly titles, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to play a host of PlayStation 4 classics on your PS5 at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N4rM16"&gt;During a normal week, Leiti Hsu dedicates at least one night to hosting her Dream Dinner Party. She hops on Clubhouse to interview guests, describing the food and atmosphere of her fictitious party as a gateway into deep, emotional conversations. Wagyu steak sizzles in front of you, she calls out, a massage table and masseuse sit on call for anyone who wants to take some time away from the (imaginary) table, she reminds you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAAudB"&gt;But last week, Hsu showed us what her Clubhouse room looks like when brought into the real world. Packed inside a New York City apartment, Hsu has brought in an actual masseuse, Tony Qin, to rub people down. A chef stands behind an island prepping “roving omakase,” like octopus salad and spicy tuna onigiri, along with various a la minute dishes. Tom Shpetner, aka Tom the Somm, aka the night’s sommelier, walks around pouring drinks. This party’s his first time back working the room, schmoozing with guests, and gushing about wine since the pandemic shut everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMoNsM"&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson, a poet at Ars Poetica, is also available to write poetry on-demand, typed on a typewriter, for guests. “Poems on a cloud,” Markuson says, as she sits on a white fluffy cushion. She writes me a post-pandemic poem about coming out the other end of it: “nourished, healed, no need to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfLZtPl2d2YH7MSxe7iN-hA1jvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663110/akrales_20210607_4616_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host Leiti Hsu welcomed guests into the apartment and encouraged them to, instead of their names, write down their go-to, after-school snack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PWr-ZgV7j27D0n5LGRV6dnJr94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663118/akrales_20210607_4616_0294.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although the event wasn’t broadcast on Clubhouse, partygoers still captured moments they could share online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mY9_nIbQOAVEHNDN_Yq0Svx4Fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665138/akrales_20210607_4616_0253.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xvOxPa"&gt;This event could represent Clubhouse’s worst-case scenario: why would anyone tune in to an app when they could join in person and eat eggplant katsu with a bunch of cool, creative people? There’s already speculation that fewer users are logging in to Clubhouse regularly, and multiple people at the party tell me this is true — they’ve seen their room numbers drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6vjzO"&gt;The app’s future seems to be on everyone’s mind. Without prompting, one person launches into a defense of Clubhouse without me ever even asking about its problems. Another person tells me that “navel-gazing” about the platform’s future and how it’s doing is a “boring question,” which, interpret that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2vm19"&gt;Hsu isn’t the first creator to make her Clubhouse rooms happen in person. Nicole Behnam of the Beyond club has hosted events in person in Los Angeles, while the Lullaby Club, a club with more than 45,000 followers, hosted its first in-person event in New York City in June. (Axel Mansoor, formerly the Clubhouse app icon and founder of the Lullaby Club is even in attendance at this party.) All these events clearly owe their attention and existence to Clubhouse, but the move to in person suggests a shift of sorts, away from the digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjPBMa"&gt;Whether the actual app numbers are waning or not, though, everyone here loves Clubhouse, if only for a chance to meet and get to know new people. The party comes off more like a reunion. The attendees had clearly already chatted, sang together, and shared their secrets on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah5acp"&gt;“It was just like, ‘Yep, I know who you are. You’re that same, silly person that I saw online,’” says an attendee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3wjhC"&gt;The broader group tends to attribute this comfort to having heard each other’s voices first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JKXP7"&gt;“If I met you on Clubhouse, and we had a heart-to-heart, or even if you heard me and I heard you, I’d remember your voice,” Kunal Sood, a Clubhouse creator with more than 35,000 followers tells me. “I feel like that’s what the app does, it gives you a feeling of wanting to be intimately connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbjqnUFSEbXe889q9ruqN2-q8Sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663114/akrales_20210607_4616_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guests embraced often, making the event feel more like a reunion than a gathering of people meeting for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masseuse Tony Qin offered massages to party guests along with a blanket to cover up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nW5Thr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASB1AQ"&gt;And now they could actually, physically connect. Most of the attendees seem to consider themselves &lt;em&gt;huggers&lt;/em&gt;, often going in for a hug, even with me, instead of a handshake. Everyone is constantly embracing and touching each other, putting their arms around one another’s shoulders, resting their heads on others’ shoulders. Contact all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udmcd7"&gt;“I don’t like shaking hands now,” one attendee and Clubhouse user tells me. “I’ve been hugging people instead now.” “We’re all so touchy-feely,” another person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l9InM"&gt;Instead of name tags, guests write their after-school snack of choice down on a sticker. Mine — mac and cheese — became my identifier and also my “safe word,” Hsu says, though I’m still not entirely clear where or when I’m supposed to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7dsjB"&gt;Hsu reminds us of this rule after three hours of partying when everyone is instructed to take a seat on the floor around the DJ booth and some microphones. Guests sing, thanks to the presence of the Lullaby Club, and Hsu auctions off a coffee date with the Knicks’ physical therapist, who is at the party, as well as the founder of the period activist group Period.org. The date sells for $400, which Hsu says she’ll donate, along with ticket proceeds from the event, to the nonprofit Food for Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS078h"&gt;But controlling an in-person crowd isn’t as easy as wrangling a group on the app. Hsu attempts to quiet everyone down, as do multiple party guests who take the mic, but they can’t stop everyone from talking and eating in their small groups. It’s a party, and there’s no mute button IRL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3UP9N"&gt;Hosting in an apartment comes with its own complications, too. Hsu needed to find a physical space, food to dish out, and, broadly, be an attentive party host who wants people to enjoy their time while also not forcing them to quiet down and stop talking, which likely won’t go over in a room of talkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/smvfYinyNpZrmfdQU8GSRbdOwzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663113/akrales_20210607_4616_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chef prepared various “roving omakase” dishes, including eggplant katsu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ir1w"&gt;“What I have been astonished by is just speaking things into existence, and on Clubhouse, you can do it to like hundreds or thousands of people,” Hsu says. “In real life, it takes a little bit of a different kind of effort to get 50 people in a room, but no matter what, it’s always speaking things into existence and [getting] the right people here, and their magic unfolds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egYgLg"&gt;Strangely, I consistently get the sense that these people — big Clubhouse users who are used to talking for hours on end — are panicking about what they say to me during this event, even though it’s never incriminating or even all that spicy. Someone tells me the app “changed their life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWJR5wVTGojlpzm4Ems7CSNB_1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663109/akrales_20210607_4616_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson of Ars Poetica sits on a “cloud,” aka a very soft, feathery pillow to type poems on-demand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNEOwe"&gt;Two Clubhouse creators, who seemingly pride themselves on honest, real, authentic conversation, worried after the event that I might quote them or actually print what they said, which suggested to me that they perhaps feel safer on the app, where conversations disappear, people aren’t supposed to record, and they control the space, despite much of this being true of the real world, too. Still, at this party, what you say might be remembered, repeated, or, if you’re standing in the presence of a journalist, written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig7yFo"&gt;They’re intensely loyal to the platform, though, with only some willing to admit to seeing cracks in Clubhouse’s buzzy facade. One person proudly tells me they haven’t logged in to Clubhouse in four months, but they believe if the app can make it through 2021, it’ll be here to stay. Another tells me multiple other platforms have reached out about signing exclusive deals, although they’re loyal to Clubhouse for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyOLsQ"&gt;The following day, two creators message me to point out that Clubhouse numbers are popping off, and sure enough, they are. Rooms are reaching thousands of listeners, a rarity recently. The numbers recalibrate to the usual, lower reach the next day, but none of these people who’ve seen the numbers drop, or have even cut back on their time, seem worried. Clubhouse gave them a platform and place to connect with people. It’s not going anywhere for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qj3Oob"&gt;As I listen to the live auction, I decide to head over to the massage table. Lying face down, I listen to guests name who they’d want at their dream dinner party, like Glenn Close, Issa Rae, and someone’s grandpa. I slightly drift off with the sound of the partygoers chatting in the background, similar to how I have in the app itself. But when my massage ends, and I realize it’s already nearly 11PM with a subway ride ahead of me, I can’t just close the app and immediately fall asleep. I instead make the rounds, saying goodbye to people I met, exchanging info and phone numbers. Maybe we’d meet up for drinks sometime soon, we say. But more likely, I’d catch them on the app, maybe raise my hand as a little hello, and then log off and go back to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thsCPu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Peter Jackson-directed documentary about The Beatles will debut on Disney Plus in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvmBV3EUogzyaBsdcfsCBK32Yhg=/0x9:1192x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467398/beatles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UocEGvQ10OE&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheBeatles" target="_blank"&gt;The Beatles/Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HxXHdq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about the iconic band directed by Peter Jackson, &lt;a href="https://www.thebeatles.com/news/%E2%80%9C-beatles-get-back%E2%80%9D-disney-original-documentary-series-directed-peter-jackson-debut-exclusively"&gt;will debut as a three-part series&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus over the Thanksgiving holiday later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cQiqN"&gt;Jackson spent three years restoring and editing some 60 hours of footage shot in January 1969 by &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512327/bio"&gt;Michael Lindsay-Hogg&lt;/a&gt; that hasn’t been seen before, and more than 150 hours of previously unheard audio. It captures John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr preparing for their first live show in more than two years, writing and rehearsing 14 new songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H187vp"&gt;The documentary also includes the band’s famous rooftop concert on Savile Row in London— you’ve probably &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F346026991&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538527%2Fbeatles-documentary-peter-jackson-directed-disney-plus-november" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen parts of it&lt;/a&gt; — a show that ended up being The Beatles’ final public performance. The film also includes songs that later were released on &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt;, two of the band’s final albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MurSHH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UocEGvQ10OE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOlKhq"&gt;Jackson, perhaps best known as the director of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, said the documentary wasn’t merely nostalgia, “it’s raw, honest, and human,” he said in a statement. “Over six hours, you’ll get to know The Beatles with an intimacy that you never thought possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j42i6O"&gt;The project has the full support of the two living Beatles McCartney and Starr, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono and Harrison’s widow Olivia. &lt;em&gt;Get Back &lt;/em&gt;was originally scheduled for a September 2020 release, then bumped to September 2021 before finally being scheduled for&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1092198/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; this Thanksgiving. It will be shown in three two-hour segments on November 25th through 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo body fat percentage calculator outperforms lab devices  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Halo’s body scanning feature, which calculates body fat percentage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hp2INOzSvHif8YuZCJPXw6Ttu9k=/1x0:2500x1666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467324/Halo_App_Body_Feature.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPXzKy"&gt;Amazon’s body fat percentage scanner performs better than other, more cumbersome methods of calculating body fat, a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf"&gt;new study showed&lt;/a&gt;. A body scan is one feature on the Amazon Halo Band subscription service, which the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;last August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4UnPx"&gt;The Halo Body feature works through smartphone cameras. Users take four photos of their bodies, which are then combined into a 3D image. Then, Amazon’s tool uses machine learning to calculate the user’s body fat percentage. When Amazon launched Halo, the company said it did an internal study to validate the feature. Now, they’ve released a study — which was funded by Amazon, but conducted with leading experts in the field — showing that the tool works well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeVa0P"&gt;The results show that the tool could be a benchmark for people looking to get more information about their bodies, says Diana Thomas, a mathematician who studies body weight regulation at West Point and was not involved in the study. She wouldn’t use it for scientific research, but it could give users another data point. “It gives you more information,” she says. “If you have a high percent body fat flagged by this, it could be a red flag for you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIOhT"&gt;Body fat percentage can be a more accurate way to assess someone’s health than their weight. Two people at the same size could have different amounts of fat relative to their overall weight and would have different health risks as a result. Having some body fat is important, but having a high percentage is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/healthy-body-fat-percentage"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart conditions and diabetes. The percentage of body fat considered healthy &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/body-fat-percentage"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; for people of different ages and sexes. Women, for example, have more body fat than men.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhvrKR"&gt;The study used data collected at two sites: Massachusetts General Hospital and Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. It had 134 participants of varying body types and included 82 women and 52 men. Of the group, 81 were Caucasian, 32 were Black, nine were Asian, four were Hispanic, one was American Indian, and seven were multiracial. It’s a small number of people, but that’s typical with this type of research, which has to run people through expensive and unwieldy tests, Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4MPuG"&gt;Each person in the study had their body fat percentage calculated through an X-ray technique that shows fat distribution through the body called dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is the gold standard. The results from those scans were compared to the Amazon system, five scales that calculate body fat (two professional and three consumer), and something called air displacement plethysmography — which uses a pod-shaped device that measures how someone’s body displaces the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RWtxJq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neStJB"&gt;The study found that the body fat percentages calculated by Amazon Halo Body were closest to those calculated by DXA. It performed better than the air displacement plethysmography device, which is often used to calculate body fat by people studying weight and body composition, but is cumbersome and tricky to conduct correctly. The pods are expensive, have to be housed in a lab, and require people to wear swim caps and tight-fighting clothing. “This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing,” Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgze6F"&gt;The accuracy held for people of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and body types. “It makes those same kinds of accuracy measurements for people across the spectrum from lean to obese,” says Steven Heymsfield, a body composition expert at Pennington Biomedical Research Center who worked on the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbMct8"&gt;Notably, in the study Halo Body got closer to the DXA’s body fat calculations than the body mass index, or BMI. BMI is often used as a first, crude estimate of someone’s body fat, and it’s calculated based on height and weight. But often, people who are muscular (and weigh more) can have a BMI that says they’re overweight — even if most of that mass is muscle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3J7l1"&gt;BMI is cheap and easy, so it’s appealing as a first look at someone’s body mass and in situations where expensive equipment, like the pod, might not be available. “BMI is still used as the red flag,” Thomas says. But if the Halo Body — which is also easy and cheaper than the lab equipment — is better than BMI, it could be a strong additional resource, she says. “It gives you more accuracy than the crude things we’ve been using.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4bd2N"&gt;There are other devices on the market that also calculate body fat percentage based on images. Heymsfield says he has some in his lab, which range from $4,000 to $20,000. The Halo Band is $99.99 and the subscription for its services is $3.99 per month. This study did not compare Halo Body to those tools. Heymsfield says, though, that based on his experience, it looks like Halo Body could work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdpoEQ"&gt;Technology like the Halo Body is shaking up the field of body composition research, after years of reliance on expensive devices, Heymsfield says. “The question now is, can we use this for research and clinical purposes, not just for the consumer out of curiosity. Can we use this as a real medical device to get body shape and size, so that people can use it to make clinical decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doLawn"&gt;It’ll take more validation studies to get to that point. Heymsfield says he’d want to see data on how accurately the Halo Body can estimate waist and hip circumference, for example. Thomas says additional studies should include people with different body types (like athletes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20JexO"&gt;Testing the tool on more people and people with different body types will also be important for consumer use to make sure everyone is getting information with the same accuracy, Thomas says. But one of the best ways to get that information will be to see what happens when people start to use it in the real world. Then, experts will be able to see what kinds of information people are getting from the tool and if they’re making any changes as a result, she says. “At the end of the day, how do you change public health? It’s not the lab rats, it’s actually the people that are using these tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
