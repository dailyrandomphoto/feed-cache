    <title>Twitter stops auto-refreshing timelines so tweets won’t disappear while you’re still reading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qd51QueZt64PWvcGwY3h4ZaNWrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148903/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7C69z"&gt;Twitter has updated its platform to prevent auto-refreshing of users’ feeds that caused some tweets to “disappear” while they were reading them. The platform first announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688697/twitter-fix-disappearing-tweets-issue"&gt;working on the update in September&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we know it’s a frustrating experience” when tweets disappeared from view mid-read, and the fix is now rolling out to Twitter’s web platform. Users will be able to load new tweets by clicking on a tweet counter bar that will appear at the top of their timelines above existing tweets in their feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fyBAeA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update to the disappearing Tweet experience is rolling out for web! Now you can choose when you want new Tweets to load into your timeline –– click the Tweet counter bar at the top.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1460304788621508618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uIbkWd"&gt;The web version of Twitter will now behave the way its native iOS and Android apps already do; neither one auto-refreshes users’ timelines, instead loading the tweets for when the user manually refreshes their feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i96RTN"&gt;Twitter has been adding new features regularly over the past several months; in addition to its audio chat room &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;Spaces, which it launched&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;rolled out its Twitter Blue premium service&lt;/a&gt; to users in the US earlier this month. For a monthly fee of $2.99, Twitter Blue’s features include the ability to “undo” tweets, ad-free articles from some publishers, and a Nuzzel-like roundup of top articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7owwu"&gt;The latest update, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;decision to shut down Fleets&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after introducing the expiring tweets feature, suggests Twitter does take users’ feedback into consideration when making changes and updates. Now if we could just persuade them to add editable tweets... &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oprah went on Clubhouse; only 23K people tuned in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oprah’s 2020 Vision: Your Life In Focus Tour With Special Guest Jennifer Lopez" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5UP2ifL765gqK6frKH6WBTZurg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148881/1209505825.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aGPyMp"&gt;Happy Tuesday, peeps. We’re so close to Thanksgiving, I can taste the cornbread casserole. Yes, that is my dish, and yes, I’m from the Midwest. No further questions, please! We have a relatively light one today, which seems to be because many companies are taking it easy through the rest of the year. The social audio companies, however, are continuing to land the deals and make the news. No rest for the startups. Although I have lots of things to say about Spotify’s audiobook company acquisition from Thursday, I’m saving it for hopefully later this week. (If you work in the literary world and have some thoughts on the audiobook market, feel free to reach out!) Otherwise, let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqFVN6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; says COVID misinformation is rampant in audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTrcGx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/business/media/coronavirus-misinformation-radio-podcasts.html"&gt;has chimed in on&lt;/a&gt; how podcast and radio hosts are handling the pandemic — they’re spreading misinformation, heeding their own advice, and dying because of it. Dark. The piece names and shames a who’s who of radio and podcasting companies, including iHeart Media, Spotify, and Apple, which have allowed some of these shows to distribute their programming on their respective platforms. (Shockingly, Cumulus doesn’t come up in the piece despite being the place where a star podcaster and radio host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733806/hot-pod-apple-event-airpods-dolby-atmos-cumulus-dan-bongino"&gt;is protesting&lt;/a&gt; a corporate vaccine mandate.) The piece specifically focuses on where these podcasts are distributed, not who’s making or monetizing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrbDTv"&gt;To give you a sense of what we’re working with in this story, among the quotes is one from a pastor and podcaster who says the virus is “an egg that hatches into a synthetic parasite and grows inside your body.” (His show is available through iHeart’s app, reports the paper.) Someone watched too much &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and didn’t realize it was fiction, I guess. This was the same person who also apparently said a “Jew coup” was behind the efforts to impeach former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjlZyl"&gt;I feel like I’ve read this same story a bunch already, but the thing I’m watching and wondering about, that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ piece mentions, is how tech companies’ moderation policies are likely stricter than many audio-specific companies’. It links iHeart’s &lt;a href="https://www.iheart.com/content/iheartmedia-podcast-content-policy/"&gt;content policy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/"&gt;Spotify’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/891-content-and-subscription-guidelines"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt;, but one that doesn’t come up — and I’m curious to know if it even exists — is Cumulus’. iHeart also declined to tell the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; whether it had any sort of policy around COVID misinformation. I care about this partially because I think as more listening time goes to the tech platforms, including Facebook, there could be a world in which a podcast can’t be published on the big tech platforms, and podcast companies have to distribute their shows through other means. (Also, moderating these podcasts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon"&gt;will be difficult, if not impossible&lt;/a&gt;, which I went long on here in February and is likely the more pressing concern.) I sense impending drama, and I’m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxU95b"&gt;Now, let’s move into tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYk311"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify keeps trying to make Greenroom happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hs2Ts"&gt;Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-15/kicking-off-a-new-slate-of-spotify-greenroom-shows-host-lauren-simmons-gives-her-two-cents-on-her-upcoming-show-money-moves/"&gt;yesterday announced&lt;/a&gt; it has a new slate of live social audio shows launching along with the news that people no longer have to log in to listen, which, great. They can do so from their browser or phone, meaning promotion of the programming will be much easier. The less friction the better. Among the shows is one about being a Taylor Swift fan and going deep on her music and another from Spotify Original podcast host Lauren Simmons where she’ll answer Gen Z’s questions. IDK! Spotify &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; promise to make its audio content and product all about the fans, and this seems to fulfill that promise pretty specifically. Will it be enough to compete with Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MvZYv"&gt;Which...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7I7Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse hosts Oprah, only 23K people tuned in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJgyoJ"&gt;Last night, Clubhouse’s head of global marketing Maya Watson got on the app and with her came Oprah Winfrey and her bestie Gayle King. The group, along with other Clubhouse folks, discussed Winfrey’s Adele interview and how it came together. This is a major get for any platform; an exclusive Winfrey chat immediately following the premiere of a highly anticipated two-hour interview? I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z79WzG"&gt;Here’s the thing, though, &lt;a href="https://ios.clubhouse.com/room/M6jlXX8J"&gt;the recording of the show&lt;/a&gt; indicates only 22.7K people tuned in at all, including people who might have even just dropped in briefly before leaving. At CBS, where the special premiered, 10 million people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/media/adele-special-concert-ratings/index.html"&gt;tuned in&lt;/a&gt;. We could interpret this in a couple ways. One could be that if the app can’t draw in a major audience for the queen of television then why even try? The other is Winfrey and the Clubhouse team suffered from a lack of marketing. If CBS had simultaneously promoted the special and the Clubhouse after-event, maybe it would have stood a better shot at success. But alas, here we are. I will say, as an aside, this is the first Clubhouse replay I’ve watched, and the experience is well built. You can skip around, view who’s talking, and essentially, relive the event as if you were in the app when it happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EpWI6"&gt;Okay a couple more small things and then we’ll wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t44dJn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K14ZXi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapchat keeps signing music deals for its TikTok copy, Spotlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZhgrG"&gt;I’ve been wanting to check in with Snapchat’s TikTok clone Spotlight and finally have an opportunity for an update. Now, you might wonder, why here in this audio-centric newsletter? To which I’d argue these short videos are, yes, visual experiences, but ones that are highly reliant on audio, particularly audio with the chance to go viral. So with that context, Snapchat yesterday announced it &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony/"&gt;signed a deal&lt;/a&gt; with Sony Music Entertainment to bring its artists’ tracks to the platform. It’s now on par with TikTok, having signed deals with all three major labels — Sony, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTlrB7"&gt;More interesting to me, though, is the deal Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757095/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-office-snl-shrek-tiktok"&gt;signed earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; with NBCUniversal to bring audio from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;to the app. This feels like the beginning of something big — dialogue and scripting having the chance to go viral, which is much more in the podcasting vein. Also it comes with the idea that companies could make actual deals for access to that audio? Maybe there’s something here for comedy podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84WhpI"&gt;One last thing before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiMI49"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch launches an incubator program for musicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIKxQW"&gt;The worlds, they converge. Twitch, primarily known for its gaming livestreams, is eyeing the music space. It already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710438/heavyweight-podcast-gimlet-exclusive-spotify-hot-pod"&gt;signed a deal with Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; to bring its musicians to the app for exclusive channels, but now it’s &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/artists/the-collective/#faq"&gt;launching an incubator program&lt;/a&gt; for artists called The Collective. Chosen participants will receive hands-on guidance from the Twitch team, as well as “prioritized discovery, promotion, and activations” from partners, like Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. The idea seems to be to make Twitch a place you spend more time in, even if you’re not streaming a video game, and the payoff for the musicians is reaching a young demographic and learning from the Twitch team itself. All the tech companies want to own not just your visual attention span, but your ears, too, and Twitch &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2015/03/31/a-new-persistent-player-for-mobile-ed23b61efa9d/#:~:text=Audio%20Only%20mode.,and%20select%20Audio%20Only%20mode."&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; an audio-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whjtvv"&gt;Alright, we’re out of here. I’m back Thursday for you paying subscribers, and if you’re interested in signing up, you can do so &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We deliver scoops, exclusives, and more analysis. If you care about audio, you should be reading it, just sayin’. Talk to you later! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv2b6g"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42PcLE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t take Nvidia’s word for it — try Nvidia’s awesome new image comparison tool, instead  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1CwwFw8ml2qG-TS3OtnHz0jVPY=/16x0:2640x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148689/twarren_rtx3080_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jiw9Co"&gt;Nvidia wants you to know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; is a mere pretender, nothing like the Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technique its GPUs can use to boost the framerate and/or image quality of your games. To prove it, Nvidia is trying an interesting new tactic by releasing a remarkably powerful image comparison tool called Nvidia ICAT, for free, so that anyone can see for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qX0zL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Ficat%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22784404%2Fnvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICAT&lt;/a&gt;, short for “Image Comparison And Analysis,” is a very simple program that lets you view a stack of gameplay screenshots and even recorded videos side-by-side, automatically lining up the frames, and allowing you to fluidly pan across each scene, zoom in and out, on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those images or videos &lt;em&gt;simultaneously. &lt;/em&gt;It’s got a drag-and-drop interface that makes pixel peeping child’s play, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;and as known pixel peepers&lt;/a&gt;, you’d better believe &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is going to be using it for more than just gaming graphics! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1hPNNhVqLmp-sxcwyaNZXRgvgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018127/nvidia_icat_verge_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s new ICAT tool in action. There’s also an image slider mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HRopCk"&gt;But Nvidia’s hope, again, is to show how poor AMD’s FSR is compared to DLSS — or even Nvidia’s own, separate spatial upscaling technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JrCJY"&gt;In case you need a brief primer: &lt;strong&gt;Spatial upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; techniques, like AMD FSR, run each of your game’s video frames one at a time through a fixed algorithm — and they don’t require a special GPU to run. Nvidia’s DLSS, on the other hand, is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;temporal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; technique that compares multiple frames and takes account of how things are moving in a video game scene, and processes all that using a neural network that runs exclusively on the Tensor cores you can only find in an Nvidia RTX GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVirmcTpJkFMIYutOrKlUg3Qu88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018071/temporal_spacial_nvidia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia illustrates how temporal and spatial upscaling differ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GvZrVb"&gt;But before you say “that’s great Nvidia, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works"&gt;I can’t actually buy your new GPUs!&lt;/a&gt;” you should probably know that Nvidia has its own spatial upscaler as well, dubbed Nvidia Image Scaling. It’s apparently been buried in the Nvidia Control Panel for some time now, and today Nvidia is open-sourcing it on GitHub with its own SDK and support for every brand of GPU. Developers can natively integrate it into their games if they want, just like AMD’s FSR. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZw8lIqddEAhoeFtINvcq_qgXmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018097/image_scaling_sdk.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pd1FHxDnVtUXO7nUOegRUWt9s64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018104/nvidia_sharpness_slider.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AfLzPU"&gt;And, the company’s baking Nvidia Image Scaling into its GeForce Experience app so you can turn it on for any game, and adjust an in-game sharpness slider (so you can see the difference) using Nvidia’s overlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRTWTo"&gt;Is it as good as Nvidia’s DLSS? Not even close, and Nvidia’s the first to admit it. In a briefing with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, product manager Henry Lin hammered us with example after example of how DLSS (particularly the new DLSS 2.3, which suffers from less ghosting around moving objects) not only beats the pants off of Nvidia’s own spatial upscaler, but sometimes performs better than a native image. Particularly when you’re looking at thin objects with lots of edges that tend to flicker:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The communications dish is crisper and less aliased with DLSS." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhG49x9kBDmAByVG-_IuzN83lVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018114/spatial_upscaler_vs_dlss_briefing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pictured communications dish is one place DLSS has an advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="viO3HL"&gt;Personally, I’ve sworn by native resolution all the way — but Nvidia’s ICAT made me curious enough to put it to the test. So I fired up &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, two games that offer both AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS, on a 4K screen at their highest quality modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOSXr4"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, I felt vindicated. Every part of the image looked fuller, crisper, and higher resolution at native 4K, up to and including the roof-mounted antenna:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZjKcx7jFn2mDeJa2h_rwBLPjr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018153/nvidia_icat_verge_b4b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll want to tap to zoom and/or download, this is a 4K image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PGW6Ia"&gt;There were even parts of the scene where AMD FSR clearly beat Nvidia DLSS, like all of these wooden textures:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe Nvidia’s neural network needs more experience with wood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="13IMFh"&gt;But when I tried out &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, it was the opposite story: almost everywhere I looked, DLSS was resolving and preserving details I couldn’t even see at native resolution, and with far, far less flicker from distant aliased objects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0B2lrXQZPuNPwENllnlkDZczbVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018227/nvidia_icat_verge_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Deathloop, the VW bus in the background looks decidedly less cartoony with DLSS, and you can see far more detail in distant textures. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lTZ85YWBntbB8eV6lqN3Y-c8DZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018242/flicker_deathloop_native.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Native 4K, blown up to show detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVRvlbyGzb195HW6AgVMdOZcb7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018241/flicker_deathloop_dlss.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DLSS Quality, at the same size. Less flicker, more detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uic9RB"&gt;That said, I still saw moments in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; where DLSS does weird things, too. Scroll up to the top of this post for one example: you can see how DLSS totally changed the sparkly finish of the Strelak Verso pistols and muddies the texture of the dirt ground in the exact same scene as my other screenshots and GIFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxkYOe"&gt;I’m not a believer in DLSS quite yet, but I’m intrigued. Nvidia’s promise is that, with enough learning, games can actually look better &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; run faster than native with DLSS turned on. For now, it’s something developers have to enable on a per-game basis, and not all games have the same version to offer, but that could change down the road. Nvidia’s Lin tells me that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;already features over-the-air DLSS updates — when you open the game, it can check with the Nvidia driver to see if there’s a new version and hot swap it at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO81r0"&gt;“Wherever you see DLSS not match native, that’s what we’ll be working on,” says Lin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUeS26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UH7OW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6bbRX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password 8 arrives on Windows with a new design and big performance improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3p3vr11wdY-XcLAIrtfVtoZ6t8=/80x0:2480x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148701/Dark___1Password_8_for_Windows_hero_image__unlocked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password 8 now includes a dark mode for Windows.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AgileBits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqIpIM"&gt;1Password is getting its first major design update in more than three years today, with the launch of 1Password 8 for Windows. It includes a &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-here"&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-dark-mode-edition/"&gt;dark mode&lt;/a&gt; that better matches some of the recent UI improvements across Windows 10 and Windows 11. 1Password is also now built on Rust, to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weY4d4"&gt;The entire desktop app now looks a lot more like the web or 1Password browser extension interface, with updated item icons, detailed views for items and vaults, and a redesigned sidebar. There’s also a new quick find feature and improvements to search results to make it easier to find the login entry you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KPPzoVtAIrzOSAhSFU-k3C5tyYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018397/NextLevelEditing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AgileBits&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The editing experience in 1Password 8 is a lot easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rfyvPD"&gt;It’s also a lot easier to edit entries now, with a new password generator and the ability to add files directly into items. 1Password 8 also includes a security questions feature, if there are still websites out there that need this type of login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjVBXb"&gt;Underneath the new design, 1Password is now built on Rust which should improve performance and security. “You won’t see this change but you’ll feel it,” &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;said 1Password founder Dave Teare&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “The app is incredibly responsive across the board, from unlocking to adding accounts to searching your items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLqA9B"&gt;If you use this dedicated 1Password Windows app with the browser extension, both will share a login state and you can even use Windows Hello for easier unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvfUO"&gt;The new 1Password 8 update is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://1password.com/downloads/windows/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available now for Windows users&lt;/a&gt;, and is still in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619846/1password-8-macos-early-access-password-manager-app"&gt;early access mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Black Screen of Death is changing back to blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGJnZKj5gvMjIhjWV4OoGJAyFbg=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148382/windows11bsod.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31lKyR"&gt;Microsoft is changing its Black Screen of Death in Windows 11 back to the original blue color. The software giant originally changed its infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;to black in Windows 11 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, to match the new black logon and shutdown screens. It was the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxuxIL"&gt;That change is now being reverted in a Windows 11 update that’s due to be released any day now. “We changed the screen color to blue when a device stops working or a stop error occurs as in previous versions of Windows,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;admits Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in recent patch notes, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/blue-screen-death-will-return-windows-11"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for the Windows 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdIZQr"&gt;Microsoft first introduced the BSOD in Windows 3.0, offering a way for IT professionals and support personnel to diagnose hardware and memory faults. A BSOD is Windows’ own kernel error, and it typically includes a dump of data that IT admins can analyze to determine what is causing the crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvEXR3"&gt;It’s not clear why the BSOD is going back to blue in Windows 11, but it could be related to IT support calls. The Blue Screen of Death has long been part of Windows, and is an easy way for end users to spot a problem and call IT support. Imagine a scenario where IT admins are trying to troubleshoot issues remotely in a pandemic, and it’s easy to see where a black screen, that’s often associated with monitor issues, could be more confusing than the Blue Screen of Death everyone is used to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s cashierless tech makes first appearance in a rival store outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jF_p2rJquYenX--Veewg-IhxmmQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148378/vpavic_181024_3050_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Go store in the US in 2018. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PbATE1"&gt;Amazon has reportedly landed its first customer outside the US for its cashierless retail technology. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/amazon-s-cashierless-tech-will-power-sainsbury-market-in-london?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the UK’s second largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury’s, will use Amazon’s system of AI-powered surveillance cameras to power a cashierless grocery store in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7lgOn"&gt;Sainsbury’s own FAQ &lt;a href="https://png.sainsburys.co.uk/"&gt;for the store&lt;/a&gt;, which is reportedly due to open to the public on November 29, says that the technology is being provided by an unnamed “third-party supplier.” But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says that supplier is Amazon, citing a source “familiar with the matter.” We reached out to Sainsbury’s for comment but the company provided only a generic statement saying it was “currently testing” cashierless tech at the store in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG6YQe"&gt;The shop, located near Sainsbury’s headquarters on High Holborn, will use machine learning technology and cameras to track what shoppers pick up. Customers scan in and out of the store with a QR code on the Sainsbury’s app and are charged automatically for any items they leave the premises with. Sainsbury’s says the system doesn’t use facial recognition, doesn’t share customers’ account data with the tech’s supplier, and that images collected by the cameras are “usually” deleted within 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JhdvFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon now operates dozens of cashierless stores in the US and UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ydu7Lr"&gt;Amazon’s cashierless tech first launched to the public in 2018 with a single Amazon Go store in Seattle. The company now has a few dozen US locations as well as six stores in the UK, where the shops are known as Amazon Fresh. The US tech giant has also been selling its systems to other retailers, including three in the US (Hudson markets, OTG CIBO Express, and Delaware North) and, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report, Sainsbury’s in the UK. The company markets its system as “Just Walk Out” technology. It’s also been slowly expanding the tech to cover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;larger grocery stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6ztce"&gt;There have been some questions about the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-07-18/amazon-s-most-ambitious-research-project-is-a-convenience-store?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;viability of Amazon’s technology&lt;/a&gt; — particularly whether the expense of its systems is actually worth it for retailers. But the slow expansion of Amazon’s stores as well as similar offerings from rival tech startups and retailers suggest the idea has some innate appeal. Or, at least, companies don’t want to find themselves outmaneuvered by Amazon and so are racing to keep up with the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CIHZn"&gt;On London’s High Holborn alone, you can now find three cashierless grocery stores (though only one is currently open to the public). In addition to the Sainsbury’s shop there’s an Amazon Fresh (the &lt;a href="https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2021/11/3/seventh-amazon-fresh-store-set-to-open-holborn-london"&gt;company’s seventh in London&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2021/10/21/tesco-getgo-learns-from-amazon-to-debut-london-shop-and-go-store/"&gt;first ever cashierless store from Tesco&lt;/a&gt;, built using technology from Israeli startup Trigo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Maps features help you avoid the holiday shopping crowds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EE6A07SbcvG2Dy6FR68ru4Uz_l4=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148221/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Busy area” label appears when you might encounter crowds.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LJ3LEG"&gt;Google is adding a handful of new features to Google Maps in time for the holiday season, which collectively should make getting around a slightly less fraught experience. The new features were announced in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/keep-it-chill-holiday-new-tools-google-maps/"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57R7lb"&gt;A new “Area Busyness” feature provides information on how popular neighborhoods are rather than just specific destinations, while the app’s “Directory” tab is rolling out globally to give more info on the stores and amenities &lt;em&gt;inside &lt;/em&gt;locations like malls and airports. Google Maps is also expanding its grocery pickup tracking feature to cover more stores across the US, and is attempting to make its restaurant reviews more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUFc3ZJYzTY-m9y4LIhD8wwIs8Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018380/ezgif.com_gif_maker_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Directory tab gives information about stores and amenities inside large complexes like airports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9X3J9"&gt;Area Busyness is an expansion of the information Google Maps already provides about the crowdedness of public transit and the popularity of specific stores and locations throughout the week. Now, rather than just offering details on specific places, Google Maps will be able to give information on how busy a general neighborhood is. Google hopes that the feature will be able to both let users avoid crowds, or hunt them down if they’re in the mood for a party atmosphere. Google says that Area Busyness will be rolling out globally on Android and iOS “in time for this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuTPMA"&gt;Meanwhile, the Directory tab will be available for any airports, malls, and transit stations around the world where Google has data available. It shows which amenities (such as airport lounges and parking lots) and stores are available inside places that are often shown as just a single location in Google Maps. Then, the app can provide granular information like opening hours and customer ratings. The Directory tab will also be available globally on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sm8UOP"&gt;The service’s restaurant reviews are also getting more detailed, with additional information on price ranges. It’s also simplifying the process of adding information on facilities like outdoor seating and delivery options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jh4Dzv"&gt;Google Maps is also expanding its grocery pickup feature, which lets users track their order status and then share with the store when they expect to arrive for collection without ever leaving the app. The feature was first launched earlier this year, and has since expanded to cover over 2,000 stores across 30 US states including Kroger Family stores like Kroger, Fry’s, Ralphs and Marianos, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsKSVj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19kRXr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTuVC5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s Naruto collab includes more than just skins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K76CmP4KTW92r7UA0rFqGJqQT04=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148104/18BR_Naruto_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characters from &lt;/em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;em&gt; are joining &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRrwuk"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1458555063534854145"&gt;a tease last week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s highly anticipated collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/naruto-x-fortnite-is-finally-here"&gt;is finally here&lt;/a&gt;. Starting Tuesday, you’ll be able to play as characters from the hugely popular anime series &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; in Epic Games’ hit battle royale. There will be four &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; characters that are now available in the in-game item shop — Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake — as well as a &lt;em&gt;Naruto &lt;/em&gt;glider, two emotes, and two loading screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcDdV5"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just getting &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; skins. A throwable paper bomb kunai is being added as a weapon to the game. You’ll be able to meet Kakashi Hatake as an NPC on the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island and get quests from him. And there will be an entire &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt;-themed Creative map you can explore based on the Hidden Leaf Village from the anime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QaRbKufooKLwTOeOy6zQYiK4Slk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007349/18BR_Naruto_ShinobiTeamworkLoadingScreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll soon see &lt;/em&gt;Naruto&lt;em&gt; characters hopping off the battle bus.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>The Balmuda Phone is a compact Android phone from a high-end toaster company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKeX3hdAWiaNxxPC4GogvZITY8w=/0x0:3339x2226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148021/7ABABA5A_D83B_498D_9F33_08E0C80D8CE5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pt1nF"&gt;Japanese design company Balmuda today announced its first smartphone at a press event in Tokyo. The straightforwardly titled Balmuda Phone is the debut product from Balmuda Technologies, a new division of the company previously known for stylish, premium home appliances like air purifiers and rice cookers. Balmuda’s toaster in particular has a cult following in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEM2i"&gt;As you’d expect, the Balmuda Phone is quite a bit different to other phones on the market. CEO Gen Terao said on stage that he felt that smartphones have gotten too big and unwieldy in recent years, so the Balmuda Phone was designed with compactness and elegance as the primary goals. It has a very sharp 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display and is roughly comparable to a 4.7-inch iPhone SE; the display is slightly bigger and the phone is 2mm wider, but the smaller bezels mean it’s 15mm shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN__psLPI6HAZ0JLLqx4FcYmkaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018299/913677DF_0F3E_4043_89E8_3AEDC7B09DF4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone is much thicker in the middle than on the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0QexY"&gt;The Balmuda Phone is a full 13.7mm thick at its thickest point, but the back panel tapers down heavily toward the edges. There’s a single large camera with a 48-megapixel sensor in the top right corner, and a similar-looking cutout in the top left houses a fingerprint sensor. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is housed in a hole-punch cutout at the top right of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XHTgf"&gt;The phone’s specs are generally mid-range. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 and there’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is just 2,500mAh, which will hopefully be offset somewhat by the lower-power processor, though we’ll have to test for ourselves to see. The phone does thankfully have wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arA421"&gt;Where Balmuda is really differentiating itself is with design. It’s a well-worn tech writing cliche to say that something “feels good in the hand,” but that was clearly Balmuda’s intent here with the compact size and curved back that nestles into your palm like a pebble. I have big hands, granted, but I think just about anyone would find this more comfortable to use than the hefty 6-inch slabs most of us carry around these days. While the case is plastic, build quality feels solid and there’s a nice contrast between the textured back panel and the glossy edges. All in all it’s a cute, attractive object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rl_ANrYzkkReSjuhmQ1rPu8ur0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018298/1C8A4701_958F_4569_B34D_2A9B396E407A.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a textured plastic back and comes in black or white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QdLYwVGs4Ir1fsShFoeNDs55Ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018304/IMG_0777.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Balmuda’s built-in calendar app, which syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNb9Ee"&gt;The software, based on Android 11, is also very different to what you’d find on most Android phones today. There’s an interactive home screen with various elements of the wallpaper customizable for different shortcuts; for example, you could swipe on one of the lines to launch Google Maps. Horizontal swipes move you between some of the built-in software, like a calendar, a notes app, and a calculator. All of these had neat design touches, like the notes app’s visual timeline of photos and memos, or the calculator app’s built-in currency conversion and ability to handle large Japanese numbers that are counted in the 10,000s rather than the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEkgcb"&gt;The Balmuda Phone will be available in Japan on contract with SoftBank later this month, and Balmuda is selling an unlocked model itself for 104,800 yen (about $920). That might sound like a lot for a compact Android 11 phone with these specs, but then $329 probably sounds like a lot for a toaster, too. In both cases, you’re paying for the design and the user experience rather than the bill of materials, and this clearly isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a conventional Android flagship. As someone who does own Balmuda’s toaster, I’m looking forward to finding out how well the phone holds up under general use — because much as I like the toaster, a smartphone is a lot more important to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JPMorgan says Tesla owes the bank $162 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRd3uJAKHapevvd14e-KOI3f_AY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147363/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKoeUc"&gt;JPMorgan has sued Tesla, claiming that the electric car company owes the bank $162 million related to a 2014 stock warrant agreement. The dispute centers around adjustments the companies made to the agreement following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 “[f]unding secured” tweet and the resulting fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO2MqN"&gt;The lawsuit was filed late Monday &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891.1.0.pdf"&gt;in the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUbC4a"&gt;According to the suit, which was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jpmorgan-sues-tesla-162-mln-related-warrants-2021-11-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, JPMorgan purchased a number of warrants from Tesla in 2014 — back when the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/tesla-raises-2-billion-with-convertible-debt-to-finance-factory"&gt;was still trying to fund the construction of the original Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmXzLm"&gt;Stock warrants give the buyer (JPMorgan, in this case) a right to purchase shares in a company (Tesla) at a set price within a certain window of time. The warrants JPMorgan bought from Tesla in 2014 were set to expire in June and July of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2x4a"&gt;Initially, the companies agreed to a “strike price” of $560.6388. If the warrants expired and Tesla’s stock price was less than that strike price, neither company would owe the other anything. But if Tesla’s stock price was above the strike price at expiration, JPMorgan says Musk’s company was basically supposed to hand over stock equal to the difference in those prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xt0HaJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;JPMorgan could change the price of the warrants if Tesla announced a merger or acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DIy5Qd"&gt;Being a massive, complicated financial transaction, JPMorgan made sure there were all sorts of legal protections in place. One was a hedge against any big announcements related to mergers or buyouts that could affect Tesla’s stock price. If something like that were to come along, the bank and the automaker were able to agree on a new strike price for the warrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJFqKc"&gt;Which brings us to the tweet. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering"&gt;famously tweeted on August 7th, 2018&lt;/a&gt; that he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Later that day, Tesla’s chief financial officer, its head of communications, and its chief lawyer wrote an email attributed to Musk that was published on Tesla’s blog explaining his announcement. Musk also tweeted that “[i]nvestor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Tesla’s investor relations head also told some press that there was a “firm offer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3tkLk"&gt;Basically none of that was true, though, as everyone found out after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk and Tesla&lt;/a&gt; over the announcement. Musk had a cursory conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, but that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaEnO"&gt;Before that truth came out, though, JPMorgan saw the resulting volatility in Tesla’s stock price and decided to amend the strike price of its warrants. It lowered the price to $424.66 and notified Tesla. Tesla agreed to a conference call scheduled for August 24th, but backed out at the last minute, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5mcLY"&gt;That same day, Tesla and Musk announced that they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17780714/elon-musk-tesla-staying-public"&gt;abandoning the attempt to take Tesla private&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDxBkA"&gt;So JPMorgan once again decided to adjust the strike price of the warrants. It made new calculations based on the response to the decision by Tesla and Musk to do an about-face, and settled on a strike price of $484.35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gKx0Dd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla allegedly ghosted JPMorgan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0pBCt"&gt;This time, Tesla “protested that no adjustment should be necessary at all because it had so quickly abandoned its going-private plans,” JPMorgan writes in its lawsuit. The bank gave Tesla its calculations and “held several conference calls” to explain them, and says Tesla “did not provide any specific objection” to those explanations. After that, JPMorgan says Tesla stopped talking to the bank for six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dc4PB"&gt;Tesla’s lawyers eventually sent a letter to JPMorgan in February 2019 claiming that the bank’s adjustments were “unreasonably swift and represented an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in Tesla’s stock.” JPMorgan wrote back, “rejecting all of [Tesla’s] allegations,” but then the two sides didn’t talk for two years. JPMorgan made another adjustment down to $96.87 in August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364073/tesla-five-way-stock-split-august-21-plan-approved-shares-accessible-cheaper"&gt;account for Tesla’s stock split&lt;/a&gt;, and says Tesla never responded to that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sLc0"&gt;By the time the expiration dates came around this year, Tesla’s stock was already on an incredible run and JPMorgan’s warrants were “‘in the money’ by a substantial amount,” according to the suit. When the bank contacted Tesla to cash out, Tesla “renewed its objections to the Adjustments.” Tesla did settle some shares with JPMorgan — the bank did not say how many — but “refused to settle in full,” the bank claims, so it triggered an “early termination” clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYF74U"&gt;JPMorgan says Tesla still owed 228,775 shares when it terminated the deal, and that those shares are worth $162,216,628.81 based on Tesla’s stock price at the time. (Potentially worse for JPMorgan, it had hedged its warrant agreement with Tesla by maintaining a short position against Tesla’s stock. When Tesla didn’t settle the remaining shares, the bank had to buy the same amount on the open market to cover that hedged bet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu6UZE"&gt;Shortly after the suit was filed on Monday, Musk was still actively tweeting in a thread he started Sunday in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/tesla-ceo-elon-musks-twitter-fight-with-bernie-sanders-on-tax-policy.html"&gt;response to a Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) tweet&lt;/a&gt; about taxes. “I like to dig my grave real deep,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1460411507066425351"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
