    <title>Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwWJc6esQdATmsHXiZJSjhJrjSs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465956/MD_Movie_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wc7Lyy"&gt;Around 15 years ago, Yoshio Sakamoto had an idea for the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game. Called &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, the game would feature longtime protagonist Samus Aran constantly pursued by some kind of all-powerful force. The idea was to instill fear in players with an enemy they couldn’t defeat. This was the same time that the Nintendo DS was becoming a breakout hit, but Sakamoto soon realized that the handheld wasn’t powerful enough for his ideas. “It was difficult to realize that concept with that hardware,” he said recently during a meeting with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1t0lec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:645329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5uYF6d"&gt;Development on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; stopped and started a few times due to these technical limitations, before eventually being shelved indefinitely. “We had put it on hold,” Sakamoto explains. Which is what made this year’s announcement at E3 such a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;not only is &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; real&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the Switch on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGr5Qo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is the fifth main entry in the franchise — it was initially titled &lt;em&gt;Metroid 5&lt;/em&gt; during the E3 reveal — and the first since &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt; in 2002. Like its predecessors, it’s a 2D side-scroller that combines action and exploration. Not only will Samus have to fight off hostile aliens but also find her way through a labyrinth-like planet full of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO2But"&gt;The main twist are new robots called E.M.M.I., predatory creatures that Samus isn’t strong enough to fight, forcing her to hide. They add an almost horror-like element to the game; Samus will have to be silent around them and can make use of technologies like a cloaking field to remain invisible. “I wanted to create something that was unsettling for players, and also would communicate this unfeeling-ness that’s inherent in something that’s robotic,” Sakamoto says of the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tfAAUd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NjCICl7dDo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nVh7fd"&gt;Sakamoto is serving as producer on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, and he says that the time was finally right for a few reasons. One was more powerful hardware in the form of the Switch. The other is a partner. In 2017, Nintendo launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt; on the 3DS&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of the Game Boy title &lt;em&gt;Metroid II&lt;/em&gt;. Development was handled primarily by Spanish studio Mercury Steam. “The reason that I actually met with them was in the hope that they’d be able to realize the concepts that I had for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread,&lt;/em&gt;” Sakamoto explains. “In meeting with them, I got the sense that they were a team that we could work together with towards a singular concept, and realize this goal that I had in mind for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwrFva"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; features 2D gameplay with 3D visuals, as well as much more fluid movement compared to earlier &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; games. Samus is quick and nimble, able to slide around and use counterattacks. She even has free aim like in &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, from the live gameplay demo I watched, the E.M.M.I. robots are appropriately terrifying, hunting down Samus with cold, calculated precision. For Sakamoto, watching it all come together so smoothly has almost made the long wait to realize his vision worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYXm75"&gt;“It’s really better than I imagined those 15 years ago when I had the idea for this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let developers put their apps inside its TikTok copycat Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_9d6CHauSkcnDmMT1QVI7bNLDk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465949/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7VtyQ"&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for developers to use viral content to directly promote their apps. Today, it’s launching Creative Kit for Spotlight, which will allow app developers to give users the power to publish directly to Snapchat’s TikTok rival, Spotlight. At the same time, Snapchat users can browse content made on those apps and then easily navigate to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJjdxo"&gt;It’s a win-win for both parties: Snapchat gains more content on its platform while developers are rewarded with additional downloads if an effect or tool they launch goes viral. Developers can also set up hashtag topics that’ll tag this content, so they can track how well it’s doing, and viewers can see everything made with that effect. Snap says it won’t take any sort of cut from developers, even if their app requires a purchase to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzEYhj"&gt;Initial partners include Videoleap and Beatleap by &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com/"&gt;Lightricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsplice.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22536936%2Fsnapchat-spotlight-app-developers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Splice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://powder.gg/"&gt;Powder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pinata-farms/id1461925824"&gt;Piñata Farms&lt;/a&gt;, among others. All these apps involve creation tools, and clearly, this is so people discover the app on the content it helped make — a real advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTYZ1z"&gt;Although this is just the start of apps using Snapchat as a distributor, it has the potential to send a sizable number of downloads their way — just like how Snapchat’s user base tends to pop when a particular filter goes viral. In 2019, Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707569/snapchat-snap-earnings-users-added-filter-gender-swap"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; between 7 and 9 million users joined its platform because of viral face filters, like one that made them look like babies. That same thing could happen for an app, which, in the long term, could change the dynamics between developers and traditional app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Fluid Office documents are coming to life in Teams, OneNote, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba8QvcvFMbXrEmdbDbWkBzYONsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465948/acastro_200514_4022_microsoftFluid_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LFEtR"&gt;The biggest change to Microsoft’s Office documents in decades is coming to life soon, as the company’s Fluid framework arrives in Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Outlook, and Whiteboard. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;first unveiled Fluid&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing how the framework allows blocks of Office content to live independently across the web. That idea is now becoming a reality, with collaborative content that can be copied, pasted, and shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb75Gu"&gt;Instead of tables, graphs, and lists that are static and bound to specific documents, Fluid components are collaborative modules that exist across different applications. They will begin showing up in Microsoft Teams first this summer, embeddable in meetings and chats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOQkf-KVaQ-0GX0WqpULlkzyB8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664522/fluidcomponents.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Fluid components roam across multiple apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyaHIc"&gt;The launch of Fluid documents coincides with employees returning to their offices and the rise of a new hybrid work experience. “We were excited about going hard and fast with Fluid, and then the pandemic hit,” says Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;So we largely put a lot of our energy onto Teams, and we think of Teams as the scaffolding that creates the connection, but now as we move back to hybrid, we increasingly believe we need more innovation in what I call the canvas that gets collaboration done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBlmxa"&gt;What Microsoft has created with Fluid is the biggest change to Office in decades. While Fluid seemed like a great future-facing concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;during its reveal last year&lt;/a&gt;, watching Microsoft demonstrate it this week has really highlighted how transformative this could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohD5Fs"&gt;Every Microsoft Teams meeting will soon come with a built-in notes experience that’s collaborative. Notes will show up within a Teams meeting or in an Outlook calendar, and anyone on the invite can just start typing away in real time. If you add a task, it immediately syncs to your other tasks across Microsoft 365, and the meeting notes are automatically synced to your Outlook calendar where you can also edit them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Mvc1AQlk-IDKrHBQuq6ezIN6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664532/fluidbeforemeetings.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluid will work in meeting agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jyuvTT"&gt;“We want collaboration to be able to start before the meeting starts, so as soon as the invite goes out,” explains Ron Pessner, a director of program management working on Fluid at Microsoft. As the meeting notes in this particular example are live and real time, you can even copy them into an app like OneNote and you’ll still see everyone making edits to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GHDGk"&gt;This living Fluid component has the potential to shift how everyone gets work done across Microsoft Teams and Office. It’s impressively quick, with no sync time, just like Google Docs. Microsoft has had similar collaboration tools in Office for a while now, but they’ve been restricted to static documents and nothing on this level of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncr52R"&gt;“We’re going to be launching the components in Teams this summer,” says Pessner. The meeting notes experience will be available in preview later this year, alongside some tests integrating it into the desktop version of Outlook. It’s likely as we see Fluid components roll out, they’ll appear first in Teams and on the web parts of Office before making their way to desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQqnZYP4C1iz0drlHdTI6W8v9tM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664518/Whiteboard.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s updated Whiteboard app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q6M4Yn"&gt;Microsoft is also transforming its Whiteboard app into a canvas to host Fluid components. Whiteboard has long existed as Microsoft’s first big collaborative tool, and this summer it’s being overhauled with the help of Fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZDfKy"&gt;New collaboration cursors will appear in Whiteboard, letting you see coworkers’ additions to a document in real time. There’s even a new virtual laser pointer that you can use to get people’s attention, or reaction stickers to make the Whiteboard canvas feel a little more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdJHrD"&gt;Fluid components like tables or task lists can also be embedded into Whiteboard, and the entire app will now look and feel the same across all devices and platforms. With Whiteboard, you could almost use the app as a dashboard to watch colleagues editing Fluid components in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IMPOC"&gt;This is just the start of Fluid making its way to Microsoft 365, and we’re bound to see more over the course of this year and beyond. It will be particularly interesting to see how Microsoft integrates Fluid more deeply into both Teams and Outlook, the main communications tools used by businesses that rely on the Office suite. If Microsoft gets the integration of Fluid right, it will forever change the way documents are created, shared, and, ultimately, how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ new front row layout arrives later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iaABIsgdGXr4kaRkjMuTRyD3dAc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465955/New_Content_Layout_for_Microsoft_Teams_Rooms_Front_Row_Give_participants_a_greater_sense_of_connection_with_Remote_attendees..0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams’ new front row layout.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RFUbPw"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;teasing its vision&lt;/a&gt; for the future of Teams meetings recently, and it’s now committing to making parts of it a reality this year. Front row is the official name for the new Microsoft Teams layout, which includes methods designed to bridge the hybrid work gap between those physically present in a meeting and remote participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5utVq"&gt;“Visually, this new layout moves the video gallery to the bottom of the screen so in-room participants can see remote colleagues face to face across a horizontal plane–similar to if they were in the same room,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gM2CgqjJwtxx1bfk7hkVqUpJQws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664544/New_Teams_Rooms_Video_Layout_Lets_People_Participate_on_Equal_Footing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front row is designed to improve hybrid work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rAaxH"&gt;Microsoft will be using its new Fluid components to power this layout, with things like agenda, tasks, and notes all collaborative and updated in real time. The meeting chat will also be highly visible in this view, giving everyone equal footing to participate in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5OS25"&gt;Alongside this new view, Microsoft is also tweaking how it manages video calls in Teams. New video layouts for Teams Rooms will utilize the larger screen real estate of monitors and screens typically found in meeting rooms to highlight remote participants more clearly. A similar redesign is coming to Teams on Surface Hub, too. A new meeting canvas with chat bubbles, live reactions, and all the latest Teams features will enter preview later this month for Surface Hub owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDKsbm"&gt;Microsoft Teams will also be updated with the new Whiteboard design that’s coming this summer. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22302185"&gt;read more about Microsoft’s Fluid components and Whiteboard plans here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India’s healthcare workers are busting misinformation on WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ttzzm3wuoMqEwI-XTZfZfXSC5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465999/VRG_4629_IMG_5013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bharti Kamble putting up a WhatsApp status on the temperature range of the human body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The backbone of India’s rural healthcare system is now tasked with beating back COVID-19 myths, one message at a time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6KC1F3"&gt;Bharti Kamble is on the lookout for fake messages related to COVID-19. Late in the afternoon, she carefully reads over 500 messages from eight WhatsApp groups. As she finishes her search, she’s relieved. “For 30 days now, I didn’t come across a single piece of misinformation as WhatsApp forward,” she says. But after a year spent fighting misinformation, Kamble remains wary. “It’s still too early to declare a victory,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPY9Jd"&gt;Kamble is an accredited social health activist (ASHA worker), the foot soldier of India’s rural healthcare system. When she started work as an ASHA, she never thought she’d be fact-checking hundreds of messages every week. Selected under India’s National Health Mission, ASHA workers are women who care for about 1,000 people within their village. They are tasked with at least 50 responsibilities, some of which include providing medicines for common ailments like coughs or fevers, maintaining over 73 different community health records, counseling on birth preparedness, ensuring antenatal and postnatal care, arranging for immunizations, providing contraception, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXmLmw"&gt;Kamble is the ASHA worker for the 701 people living in the remote village of Bolakewadi in Western India’s Maharashtra state. In some ways, they’ve been lucky during the pandemic — the village hasn’t reported a single COVID case. It is astonishing because over 50 percent of villagers regularly migrate 285 miles north to India’s financial capital Mumbai, a city that became a COVID hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CIhHL4nRX9CEBoOt0fOf4zqr_AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660962/VRG_4629_IMG_4888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many remote villages with no internet connectivity. ASHA workers Mandakini Kodak and Rekha Dorugade trek over six miles to reach a remote village — making people aware of the vaccination drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5N84kd"&gt;Starting in March 2020, nearly &lt;a href="http://nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/Update%20on%20ASHA%20Programme_2019_for%20Web.pdf"&gt;1 million&lt;/a&gt; ASHA workers across 600,000 Indian villages were&lt;a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/ModelMicroplanforcontainmentoflocaltransmissionofCOVID19.pdf"&gt; tasked&lt;/a&gt; with containing the community transmission of coronavirus. They survey their populations to find suspected COVID cases, monitor patients’ oxygen and temperature levels daily, contract-trace, ensure patients complete their quarantine period, and help them get medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2dKYm"&gt;Their daunting task is complicated by misinformation, which spreads like wildfire on social media platforms. While surveying in March 2021, Kamble found a woman in her 80s with heavy fever and fatigue. “Why didn’t you take paracetamol tablets from me?” Kamble asked. The old woman replied, “What if you would have given my name to your seniors [supervisors], asking me to quarantine? I heard that fasting and praying to God alleviates the fever.” It was the third day of her fasting. Without any delay, Kamble gave her packets of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and paracetamol tablets. “Within four days, she felt better,” Kamble said, but her task was far from over. Kamble began investigating and found that “fasting cures COVID” was a misinformation message forwarded multiple times in the vernacular language Marathi on village WhatsApp groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an883l"&gt;Kamble, who is a part of over eight such groups, immediately messaged that fasting is no cure for COVID-19. She explained the science behind a proper diet and the importance of modern medicines. She wanted to make sure that no one else tried to fast away a fever. “We didn’t get training on busting misinformation. We learned on the job and with interactions from the people,” she says. She may not have had any formal training, but Kamble’s had plenty of practice over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kLaKig7xCHlUVNWMuoKw7AJ88-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660960/VRG_4629_IMG_4853.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandakini Kodak makes notes on misinformation spread in the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Dlu3"&gt;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, India has tested positive for pseudoscience and misinformation, leading to a surge in cases. India reported over 29 million cases, with more than 353,000 people succumbing to the virus as of June 9th, 2021, with experts stating that this figure remains a massive&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/25/world/asia/india-covid-death-estimates.html"&gt; undercount&lt;/a&gt;. Several leaders of the elected far-right Bharatiya Janata Party have been vocal about drinking cow urine to prevent COVID, with a few even making&lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/bjp-mla-bairia-surendra-singh-cow-urine-gaumutra-to-stop-covid19-on-camera-1800129-2021-05-08"&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlCteq"&gt;Last year, its leaders organized a gaumutra (cow urine) drinking&lt;a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/18/volunteer-falls-ill-after-drinking-cow-urine-bjp-leader-arrested-for-hosting-party.html"&gt; event&lt;/a&gt;. Kamble came across several such messages. “What do you even say to something like that? A lot of people in fact did try it.” She started sourcing scientific messages from doctors and began messaging about COVID treatments that actually worked. “If you directly counter misinformation saying it’s wrong, then people don’t listen and start provoking you,” she explains. Instead, her antidote is disseminating scientific information in the easiest possible way. Eventually, she says, people realized cow urine is no cure for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkrr3o"&gt;Kamble isn’t the only ASHA worker using WhatsApp to curb misinformation. Netradipa Patil, an ASHA and leader of over 3,000 ASHAs from Kolhapur’s Shirol region, found that every family member in her surveying area of 1,000 people has at least one smartphone. “When we distributed COVID awareness pamphlets, people threw them [away]. That’s when I decided to act smartly.” When she saw instances of fake news and misinformation, she made a hyperlocal WhatsApp group with 200-plus members. “When unscientific messages go viral, I dial up at least three COVID doctors and confirm all the facts,” she says. She then types out messages, makes videos, and forwards newspaper clippings. This has taken a lot of her time but has helped save many lives. “In COVID’s second wave (March to June 2021), my area reported less than 10 cases and no deaths,” she says proudly. In contrast, Kolhapur district as a whole reported a case fatality rate of&lt;a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/kolhapur-reports-3-5-covid-fatality-rate-india-average-at-1-09-team-of-experts-rushed-to-district-9618261.html"&gt; 3.5 percent&lt;/a&gt; in May 2021 — one of the highest in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ESEiRoIf5QT0yto6LyL8ypPr6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663699/VRG_4629_IMG_5097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, Netradipa Patil formed a hyperlocal WhatsApp group where she consistently shares verified scientific information related to COVID-19 and its treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zi1ehC"&gt;By June 2020, Patil had mobilized other ASHAs to form similar groups. In addition to combating misinformation over WhatsApp, they also make an effort to bust misinformation during their surveys of their community so they can reach people without internet access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGIyYn"&gt;The situation became more urgent this spring. Starting on March 1st, 2021, India began its vaccination drive for citizens over the age of 60. ASHAs were to make a list of those citizens and submit it to the local civic authorities — but even gathering names became an uphill battle. “Senior citizens kept telling me that COVID vaccination is like slow poisoning. ‘Within six months of getting jabbed, we will die,’” Patil said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The misinformation that “India’s population has increased a lot and the Government is using vaccines to reduce it” spread rapidly. “It sounds funny, but it took two months of messaging and door-to-door visits to convince more than 90 percent of people to get vaccinated,” she recalls. Patil also shared her photo of getting jabbed and said, “I’ve taken both the doses, and I am alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxy5MH"&gt;Even after people get vaccinated, the job of ASHAs doesn’t end. In Kolhapur’s Pernoli village of 2,265 residents, two people died within a few days of the vaccination. This was a nightmare scenario for ASHA workers Mandakini Kodak and Rekha Dorugade. Suddenly, everyone in their village resisted vaccination. They probed these deaths and found both people were asthmatic and COVID positive — and that they hadn’t received reputable care. “They took injections and medicines from a quack. How can someone blame the vaccines then?” asks Kodak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_rWX9EhoJBtqjtVjz8GNUSgesI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660958/VRG_4629_IMG_4805.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several people from remote villages fear vaccination because of rampant misinformation. Often, people hide in their houses or run away when ASHA workers are out surveying the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPsIxs"&gt;Often, misinformation is intertwined with superstitious beliefs. “Last year, several villagers refused to follow COVID protocol, saying that the village God won’t let Corona in,” remembers Kodak. Kamble faced something similar. As COVID cases kept increasing across the hinterlands, several villagers decided to swarm the local temple for a “community prayer.” Kamble started messaging that even if a single person tests COVID positive, it could lead to community transmission. She put infographics of COVID protocols as her WhatsApp status. “Faith is completely fine, but when it overpowers logic and science, it becomes a problem,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CVxdc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0bm6N7"&gt;ASHAs work in stifling conditions with inadequate safety gear and receive “performance-based incentives” based on the tasks completed. Despite working for over a decade, they aren’t recognized as full-time workers and average a monthly pay of $41 to $55 in Maharashtra. “We are busting misinformation, saving countless lives, and completing surveys on phones, yet the Government doesn’t even reimburse us for the internet,” says Patil. With poor pay, many ASHAs double up as farmworkers to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPHShV"&gt;Their limited resources aren’t well-understood in the communities they serve. Last year, a rumor began circulating on WhatsApp that said that for every COVID-19 patient detected, the Central Government would send money to local governments, Kodak says. This was not true. “The Government has no money to even buy hand gloves and sanitizers for us, how and why will they spend on detecting cases?” asks Kodak laughingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVorus"&gt;The ASHAs’ mission to contain COVID-19 outbreaks is often hampered by their poor-quality oximeters and infrared (IR) thermometers, provided by the government. While surveying, Maya Patil, an ASHA from Shirol, found her oximeter wouldn’t show any readings. There were problems with the oximeter’s display and quality. “It would show a reading only when indoors. Surveying inside the houses of containment zones with inadequate ventilation means risking life, but the Government doesn’t understand this, and [it refuses to give] us better-quality equipment,” she says. As a result of the faulty readings, many people refrain from getting their oxygen levels tested. “Many lives will be at risk if there’s a community transmission because of faulty equipment,” says Maya Patil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATy8uznOpTVPFCWXL7sN6sMU8w0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660959/VRG_4629_IMG_4850.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A major hindrance to contact-tracing comes from the poor-quality oximeters and infrared thermometers provided to ASHAs by the government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xm5KB"&gt;Kamble experienced a similar problem from a 72-year-old woman. “Her oxygen level had dropped to 70. The family didn’t believe it and started verbally abusing me,” she says. The family started accusing Kamble of planning a conspiracy to send the old woman to the quarantine center. Somehow, she persuaded the family to consult a doctor. The patient’s oxygen level was diagnosed to be lower. “Less oxygen doesn’t always mean COVID, and people don’t even know what the normal oxygen level is,” Kamble says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zU6w5F"&gt;To educate the community and regain their trust, Kamble turned again to social media. She found a graphic representing the required oxygen level and put it up as a WhatsApp status. She sent the same photo to multiple WhatsApp groups, eventually reaching over 500 people directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0kvAU"&gt;“My inbox was flooded with replies, with some mentioning they had taken a screenshot as a reference, while others thanked me for making them aware of it,” she says. “The same family now asks me to monitor the oxygen level daily.” For something as simple as checking oxygen, Kamble was forced to spend several hours working to counter misinformation on WhatsApp. Now, she is facing off with senior health officials regarding the mediocre-quality equipment. Already, she has gotten several of her oximeters and IR thermometers replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoTAcw"&gt;It’s one of the triumphant stories ASHAs share about countering misinformation using technology. “There are many people who thank us for asking them to get vaccinated,” says Kodak. While some people in the area tested COVID positive, none were hospitalized, vindicating the ASHAs’ vaccination campaign. “It’s refreshing to listen to such stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMUnoz"&gt;“Even if people disagree with our messages, they do read and discuss. While surveying, we spend at least three hours every day countering such misinformation,” Kamble says. While misinformation in her own village has slowed, the list of pseudoscientific messages continues ricocheting around WhatsApp groups in other areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tArK97"&gt;“One shouldn’t take a vaccine while menstruating”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39VxIv"&gt;“If you have taken the vaccine, you should avoid sunrays for a week”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uWCvp"&gt;“Snorting camphor powder increases your oxygen level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHOsqH"&gt;“Onion eaten with rock salt keeps away Corona.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DIS1v0"&gt;These are just a few of the hundreds of messages Kodak has received lately. She addresses every statement, often while working 10- to 12-hour days. “If I save someone, I will have done my job,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus original series will now release on Wednesdays, not Fridays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93AQehx-5obrd0f_ngOn1Guqw3g=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465654/ARC_101_09922.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki was Disney’s first show to make the switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRRfKx"&gt;From July, all of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ global original series will be released on Wednesdays rather than Fridays, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/disney-plus-shifts-original-series-to-wednesday-release-date-schedule-1234968809/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change has reportedly been made to give the service’s increasing number of original TV shows more space in the schedule, while the service’s original movies will continue to release on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFpaol"&gt;Disney has announced a number of new premiere dates following the change, with most now releasing a few days later than previously planned. &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc. &lt;/em&gt;spinoff &lt;em&gt;Monsters at Work &lt;/em&gt;for example, will now release on Wednesday, July 7th rather than July 2nd, while &lt;em&gt;Turner &amp;amp; Hooch&lt;/em&gt; has shifted from July 16th to Wednesday, July 21st. However a couple of series will now release earlier, like &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse &lt;/em&gt;batch two, which will now be available on July 28th (yes, a Wednesday) rather than July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX5xjz"&gt;The first Disney Plus show to have premiered on a Wednesday was &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, which was reportedly the service’s most watched premiere. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;Wednesdays are the new Fridays,&lt;/a&gt;” actor Tom Hiddleston announced. That’s in contrast to previous series like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian, &lt;/em&gt;which released on Fridays in competition with Netflix and Amazon’s new releases. &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes that Fridays have historically been seen as the worst times to premiere new shows on linear TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon put AI cameras in its Chinese offices that only let smiling workers inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wG13SMls2yqJWC2MhPD_lenFJMY=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465571/canon_smile_recognition.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Smile recognition” in action. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Canon Information Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mty2Mn"&gt;Tech company Canon has come up with a downright dystopic way to tackle the problem of workplace morale: it’s installed cameras with AI-enabled “smile recognition” technology in the offices of its Chinese subsidiary Canon Information Technology. The cameras only let smiling workers enter rooms or book meetings, ensuring that every employee is definitely, 100 percent happy all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwJMrO"&gt;This depressing tale was highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b74b6ad6-3b8d-4cd8-9dd6-3b49754aa1c7"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how Chinese companies are surveilling employees to an unsettling degree with the help of AI and algorithms. Firms are monitoring which programs employees use on their computers to gauge their productivity; using CCTV cameras to measure how long they take on their lunch break; and even tracking their movements outside the office using mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sQTm1W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technologies are increasing the pace for people who work with machines instead of the other way around”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7fTSoe"&gt;As the King’s College London academic Nick Srnicek told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;: “Workers are not being replaced by algorithms and artificial intelligence. Instead, the management is being sort of augmented by these technologies [...] Technologies are increasing the pace for people who work with machines instead of the other way around, just like what happened during the industrial revolution in the 18th century.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbilPP"&gt;Canon Information Technology actually announced its “smile recognition” cameras &lt;a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/426044486_162522"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; as part of a suite of workplace management tools, but the technology doesn’t seem to have gotten much attention. Indeed, the fact it passed under the radar is a good illustration of just how common surveillance tools like this are becoming — and not just in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbouYm"&gt;Although readers in the West sometimes have a tendency to dismiss the sort of surveillance described by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; as a foreign phenomena, countries like the US and UK are just as culpable. Amazon is perhaps the prime example of this dynamic: it’s known for squeezing every ounce of effort from its warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463132/amazon-injury-rate-warehouses-osha-data-report"&gt;at the expense of their health&lt;/a&gt;, and even ranking their productivity using algorithms before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;firing those at the bottom of the scale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcmGaL"&gt;Such modern-day Taylorism is not restricted to blue collar jobs, either: many modern software suites like Microsoft 365 come with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/26/microsoft-productivity-score-feature-criticised-workplace-surveillance"&gt;built-in surveillance tools&lt;/a&gt;. And with more people working from home because of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-bosses-are-using-software-to-monitor-remote-workers-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it/"&gt;more companies are deploying these features&lt;/a&gt; for fear of losing control over their workers. (Or, for a slightly more cynical read: they’ve always &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to use these tools and the pandemic provides a handy pretext.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HZOxK"&gt;In other words: AI-enabled smile recognition cameras are in many ways the least dangerous types of surveillance technology. They have the benefit of being obvious. Other systems of control are much more subtle, and probably coming to an office near you sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ latest battery pack can create a wireless charging sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EieTrvi6Scv6mcLzwY2EsS3iv_k=/0x0:1467x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465331/press_release_powerbanks_1536x864.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery pack can wirelessly charge two devices at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toclEy"&gt;Zens’ new battery pack has a wireless charger on both sides, allowing you to charge two Qi-compatible devices simultaneously in what can only be described as a “charging sandwich.” The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-dual-powerbank"&gt;Dual Powerbank&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/blog/experience-the-convenience-of-on-the-go-wireless-charging/"&gt;announced alongside&lt;/a&gt; a trio of other battery packs including the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank/"&gt;Magnetic Single Powerbank&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-with-stand"&gt;Single Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which can itself be wirelessly charged, as well as wirelessly charge other devices), and the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-stand-10000mah/"&gt;10,000 mAh Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXxnvy"&gt;Although you could theoretically use it to charge two Qi-compatible phones, the intended use case appears to be charging an iPhone along with an accessory like a pair of AirPods. That’s because one side of the battery pack includes a MagSafe connection, which should keep it centered on iPhone 12 devices featuring the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;embedded magnets&lt;/a&gt;. However, the accessory isn’t capable of fast charging at MagSafe’s 15W maximum, instead it’s limited to 7.5W when charging an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROzAL6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a capacity of 4,000 mAh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SVSDy0"&gt;Otherwise, the Dual Powerbank includes a USB-C port for charging its 4,000 mAh battery, as well as a small kickstand on one side so you can keep your phone propped up while it’s charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F7tcF"&gt;While the likes of Zens and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; have been quick to make use of Apple’s latest wireless charging tech, the Cupertino company is yet to release a MagSafe battery pack of its own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that such an accessory is in development at the company, but that it’s facing development issues relating to the iPhone’s software thinking it’s overheating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V74jd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 17th, 4:28AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Zens’ confirmation of iPhone charging speeds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96t9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4N4qs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it was clear from OnePlus’ phones that there were still at least some ties to Oppo. Components like display panels were often seemingly identical, and even supposedly proprietary technology like the Dash fast-charging system was cross-compatible with Oppo’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXKvIi"&gt;“OnePlus and Oppo are two completely independent companies,” a OnePlus representative told me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt; by way of explanation. “R&amp;amp;D, finance, sales channels, daily operations, etc operate independently. The two parties share some common investors. OnePlus leases Oppo’s manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO5T4K"&gt;Lau says that OnePlus will continue to operate independently, despite the further integration with Oppo. But he hasn’t said exactly what would be integrated, and given the existing commonalities between the two brands’ products, it’s not obvious what this will actually mean for consumers. Lau says OnePlus will continue to operate its own events and customer feedback channels, for example, but adds that Oppo’s greater resources should help OnePlus be more efficient with software updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qZaPx2"&gt;It’s not a big secret that OnePlus and Oppo have been coming closer to an explicit reunion in recent years. Lau became Oppo’s chief product officer last year while keeping his role at OnePlus, and the two brands merged R&amp;amp;D departments back in January. More recently, OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d start using Oppo’s ColorOS for its phones in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFOvaO"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development. Will this manifest itself in tangible changes to OnePlus devices? Who can say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHs4XT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Kr3ROx"&gt;If you’re a OnePlus fan, though, there’s no reason to view the closer ties as a bad thing. The company has long left its “flagship killer” roots behind, now competing at the high end with expensive “Pro” phones while offering a range of cheaper Nord devices at the low-to-mid range. Oppo, for its part, releases far more phones a year than OnePlus (mostly in Asia), but its high-end flagships are every bit as good. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite phone of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qarkGX"&gt;Whether OnePlus would admit it or not, the company has always been associated with Oppo behind the scenes. The biggest change here is that OnePlus is now saying so out loud — while making the association even tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like its 120Hz Pro IGZO OLED screen are also a match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCzqb7S-ARMaHwm6Nw-C6Wl1s8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664394/leitz2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Bundled accessories for the Leitz Phone 1.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYfpg"&gt;On the other hand, the Aquos R6 doesn’t come with a lens cap and matching case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqucke"&gt;SoftBank is also selling the Aquos R6 alongside the Leitz Phone 1, and isn’t attempting to hide the similarities behind the two phones. Instead, it’s positioning the R6 as a model for someone who just wants the Leica camera, and the Leitz Phone 1 for those who value Leica’s hardware design. And besides, what could be more in keeping with Leica tradition than tweaking existing products with a red dot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO6MRq"&gt;Preorders for the Leitz Phone 1 start tomorrow in Japan. It’ll cost 187,920 yen, or about $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;
