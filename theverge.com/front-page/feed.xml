    <title>The Boring Company tests its ‘Teslas in Tunnels’ system in Las Vegas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0K6Q0NZVSksI3xbFs1gh6uRKso=/0x2:2500x1669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347513/LVCC_Loop_Hero_1_April_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dnQRe6"&gt;Elon Musk’s Boring Company started shuttling passengers through the twin tunnels it built underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) this week, as part of a test to get the system ready for its full debut in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLPzAW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGMdhJuCw4c"&gt;Videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPTr4DwFb3F/"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringCompany/comments/nksr9n/the_las_vegas_convention_center_loop_is_minutes/"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://teslaownersonline.com/threads/rode-vegas-loop-today.18103/"&gt;around the internet&lt;/a&gt; by the people who showed up for the test offer the most coherent glimpse yet at Musk’s solution for traversing the LVCC campus. It is quite literally just Teslas being driven through two 0.8-mile tunnels — a far cry from the autonomous sled-and-shuttle ideas that Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15476268/elon-musk-the-boring-company-car-tunnel-concept-video"&gt;once proposed for The Boring Company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOrLfJ"&gt;There are three stops to the “LVCC Loop” system. The stations at either end are above ground, while the one in the middle is at the same 30-foot depth as the tunnels. The Boring Company used a few dozen Tesla vehicles — including Model 3 sedans, and Model Y and Model X SUVs — during the test. While the company has talked about making riders call for cars using an app, the test only required them to walk up to the next available car. Test riders then hopped in, went to one of the other two stations, and repeated. It appears most riders got between seven or eight to a dozen rides during the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lB8ays"&gt;Schlepping from one end of the LVCC campus is no quick feat on foot, especially after the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) recently added a whole new wing. Taxi lines and ride-hailing wait times are notoriously long, too. So any solution that makes it easier to get around the grounds will likely appeal to convention-goers, even if the amenity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257849/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-tunnel-finished-digging"&gt;cost the LVCVA $52.5 million&lt;/a&gt; ($48.6 million of which went to The Boring Company). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="labgik"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The full public debut is in just a few weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIQfVI"&gt;The Boring Company says the Loop will ultimately turn a 45-minute walk into a two-minute ride, though it’s not down to that level of efficiency yet (hence the test). In one video, one of the test riders said they had to wait about three to five minutes for a few of the rides, though even with a top speed of around 40 miles per hour, trips between stations appear to have taken about a minute to a minute-and-a-half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruJ3qu"&gt;One of the things increasing that total travel time was the underground station. There were times when test riders pulled into the station only to run into some congestion. The drivers have to maneuver around other parked Teslas, people getting in and out, and cars queueing up to reenter the tunnels. It’s a tight fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFtQuQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We had a lot of fun getting to know the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VegasLoop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VegasLoop&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LVCVA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LVCVA&lt;/a&gt; LVCC expansion. Here is a taste of the experience with a full video coming very soon on YouTube. Good times! &lt;a href="https://t.co/pb51MZjqYT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pb51MZjqYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miles to Memories (@milestomemories) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milestomemories/status/1397272263771099139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3iDaSA"&gt;There was also just some general confusion as people got used to how the system worked. Passengers were being constantly reminded to leave the doors open when exiting the vehicle to speed up the transition to the next ride. One person got &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milestomemories/status/1397272263771099139"&gt;bonked on the head&lt;/a&gt; by one of the Model X’s Falcon Wing doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mt9SHS"&gt;The big question with The Boring Company’s efforts in Las Vegas is pretty much the same as it always is with Musk’s ideas: how will it scale? The company says it wants to eventually transport 4,400 people per hour through the LVCC Loop’s tunnels, though TechCrunch discovered &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised/"&gt;documents late last year that seem to show it will only be able to transport 1,200&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the LVCC Loop, The Boring Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;wants to build a massive tunnel system that runs under the whole city&lt;/a&gt;, including the Las Vegas Strip and the airport. It claims this massively scaled-up version of its underground highway will be able to handle a little more than 50,000 passengers per hour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRUcPw"&gt;The Boring Company has claimed it plans to allow a max speed of 150 miles per hour in these tunnels but has limited speeds during the tests so far. And while the goal is to ultimately have the Teslas drive themselves, the system will rely on human drivers for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDaMEc"&gt;Reaching that top speed is one of the key things &lt;a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/loop"&gt;The Boring Company says sets its “Teslas in Tunnels” idea&lt;/a&gt; apart from, say, a subway system. (Another is cost, which we’ve seen the company tout in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269188/elon-musk-boring-company-miami-tunnel-mayor-francis-suarez"&gt;most recent proposal in Miami&lt;/a&gt;.) It likely won’t be attainable unless the company is able to automate the driving, as the tunnels are too tight for a human driver to continuously (and carefully) navigate at such high speeds — another thing that was obvious from videos of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ixcMU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Iran bans cryptocurrency mining for four months to stave off blackouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-Rfntc_gjHvn7WqejdOxZqiTRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347462/mdoying_180308_2373_0092still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N7q6hv"&gt;Iran is temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/iran-bans-crypto-mining-to-keep-the-lights-on-over-summer?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;banning cryptocurrency mining&lt;/a&gt; after some of the country’s major cities experienced repeated blackouts. President Hassan Rouhani said that the ban would last until September 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63YQJj"&gt;The country &lt;a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/436178/Iran-electricity-issue-should-we-expect-blackouts-again"&gt;has experienced summer blackouts in years past&lt;/a&gt;, and while the current round of outages is mostly being blamed on a drought that’s affecting the country’s ability to generate hydroelectric power, it seems that the Iranian government is eager to cut down on any aggravating factors. Power-hungry cryptocurrency mining operations, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkwW8a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260829"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Iran operates a program where Bitcoin miners must register with with the government, pay extra for electricity, and sell their coins to the central bank. President Rouhani stated that the legal mining operations in the country consume around 300MW a day; Iran’s state-owned grid operator, Tavanir, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/iran-bans-crypto-mining-to-keep-the-lights-on-over-summer"&gt;reportedly claimed&lt;/a&gt; a more conservative daily usage of 209MW. Either number is small compared to the 2,000MW &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/26/iran-bans-all-crypto-mining-after-summer-power-cuts-strike"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is used by illegal miners, which reportedly make up 85 percent of the country’s operations. The deputy minister of electricity and energy &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/bitcoin-mining-craze-on-subsidized-power-pressures-iran-s-grids?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;even told one news organization&lt;/a&gt; that miners were using the free electricity afforded to mosques to run mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb4Sk3"&gt;President Rouhani seemed to joke about how much mining was unlicensed in the country, saying that “everybody has a few miners laying around and are producing Bitcoins,” though he also said that the unlicensed miners were the reason for the ban, which will apply to all mining in the country. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260829"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the licensed mining operations have already voluntarily shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yvaoom"&gt;While it could be argued that those who were already breaking the law may not be likely to stop because the government told them to, Iran has been cracking down on the unlicensed operations, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-21/iran-enlists-its-spies-to-hunt-down-power-hungry-bitcoin-miners?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;enlisting spies to track them down&lt;/a&gt;. Tavanir also provides rewards for reporting people who are mining illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDlX9A"&gt;Crypto observers outside Iran will likely want to keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin to see how (or if) it reacts to an estimated 3.4 to 4.5 percent of the network’s mining capability being thrown into jeopardy. Bitcoin has had a turbulent time recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332677/india-cryptocurrency-trading-mining-possession-ban-law-report"&gt;as India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/major-china-bitcoin-mining-hub-lays-out-harsher-crackdown-measures.html"&gt;parts of China&lt;/a&gt; look to ban it, and as Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;has stopped accepting&lt;/a&gt; the cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;citing environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Amy Klobuchar calls on Justice Department to probe Amazon-MGM deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Considers Nominations For Judges" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJR0U2caILnIyaTElhtjvCcdlR0=/0x1:4637x3092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347325/1232578246.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YshABB"&gt;On Tuesday, Amazon announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;it had reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; to purchase the film and TV goliath MGM for $8.45 billion — and leading antitrust figures in Congress aren’t happy. In a letter today, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) sounded the alarm over the size and scope of the deal, calling on the Justice Department to investigate the acquisition before it finalizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx3yIP"&gt;“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers,” the senator said in a statement Wednesday. “The Department of Justice must conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won’t risk harming competition.” Klobuchar chairs the committee tasked with overseeing competition in digital markets in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyceXI"&gt;The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vI2eCR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts59OK"&gt;MGM is behind some of the most popular Hollywood franchises, including the James Bond and Rocky libraries. The merger agreement signals that Amazon is getting serious about expanding its currently limited media empire. A majority of Amazon Prime subscribers, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-q1-2021-prime-video-viewers-1234963065/"&gt;over 175 million&lt;/a&gt; out of the 200 million plus people, have streamed content on the company’s Prime Video service. The merger would bring hundreds more films and TV shows to that library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMUNgg"&gt;The concern over Amazon’s new acquisition isn’t limited to Democrats. Republicans like Rep. Ken Buck (CO) and Sen. Josh Hawley (MO) said Amazon should not be permitted to purchase the media company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAe5ei"&gt;“This sale should not go through. Amazon is already a monopoly platform that owns e-commerce, shipping, groceries &amp;amp; the cloud. They shouldn’t be permitted to buy anything else. Period,” Hawley said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1397542482720735235?s=20"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqXoZA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1397609137652051973?s=20"&gt;Buck quote-tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Hawley’s tweet, agreeing with his statement. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday, a spokesperson for Buck confirmed that he believed the merger should not go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlRk7y"&gt;“Rep. Buck is extremely concerned by Amazon’s extensive monopoly power that continues to expand through acquisitions,” a spokesperson for Buck said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday. “He is also disappointed with the FTC’s lack of scrutiny and failure to adequately enforce antitrust laws over the past decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFZ2kv"&gt;Over the last few years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have engaged in sweeping investigations into Big Tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Amazon has been a particular lightning rod for Republicans due to a long-running feud between founder Jeff Bezos and former president Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc2rWk"&gt;On Tuesday, Amazon faced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453125/dc-attorney-general-amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-favored-nation"&gt;first major antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; posed by DC Attorney General Karl Racine. The lawsuit accuses the e-commerce giant of suppressing competition and placing strict conditions on third-party sellers and how they price their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxfaSi"&gt;“The DC Attorney General has it exactly backwards – sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement responding to the lawsuit Wednesday. “Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abIt84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Of course repairing the new Apple TV remote is harder than simply unscrewing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0kk6cG65R8KV4CoOps1KM2cWmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347302/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lMycCY"&gt;Apple, a company notorious for making its products difficult to repair, has given us a real head-scratcher of a repair situation with its next-generation streaming remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxu4M8"&gt;At issue here are a pair of screws that would appear to make repair semi-straightforward but absolutely do not. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;iFixit tore down&lt;/a&gt; the second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which will ship with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; streaming box, and found that these two screws on the outside of the remote do basically nothing. Do not, in other words, expect to be able to fix your new remote or its battery easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1xfRQ"&gt;First off, Apple’s new wand features a one-piece &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22455294%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum outer casing&lt;/a&gt; design — meaning that while minimal and pretty, this thing was probably already going to prove difficult to tinker with. You might think, therefore, that a pair of tiny screws at the bottom of the remote near its charging port would offer easy access to the thing most likely to need to be repaired on this remote: the battery. You would be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The previous generation of Siri Remote (left) shown next to the newer remote (right). The newer remote has two tiny screws at the bottom. They do nothing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZBXF0"&gt;Instead, iFixit’s video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;teardown indicated&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny plate that covers its Lightning port — another Siri Remote sin, if I’m being honest — effectively goes nowhere. To get inside the remote, iFixit needed to use a handful of specialized tools to pop off the buttons on the remote, remove more tiny screws and tiny component parts, wriggle the remote’s inner frame out of its aluminum shell, unscrew the logic board from the remote’s skeleton, and finally, pop out the 1.52Wh battery. Oh, and its cables are soldered together with those of the Lightning port, making DIY repairs all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AZ5q0"&gt;Is the lack of simple repairability on the next-generation Siri Remote entirely surprising? Well, no. Of course not. Repairing the first-generation Siri wand was similarly a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14Tz1DWIX4"&gt;whole entire thing&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is also notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/microsoft-and-apple-wage-war-on-gadget-right-to-repair-laws"&gt;lobbying against&lt;/a&gt; right-to-repair legislation, has been shown to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;internally conflicted&lt;/a&gt; about its own position on the matter, and has used &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/right-to-repair-is-less-complicated-and-more-important-1834672055"&gt;bad-faith arguments&lt;/a&gt; to shield itself from criticism about how difficult its products are to fix, particularly where it relates to proprietary component parts and repair instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZug1"&gt;But for a remote with a rechargeable battery, Apple sure makes it difficult to actually get in there and access one of the things most likely to need replacement down the road. And tricking us with a pair of screws that do little for repairability doesn’t exactly curry favor on the repair front, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>San Jose approves Google’s gigantic and controversial new downtown campus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1a2RD4u--nR_6rARLz1Xzn2N4I=/165x0:1872x1138/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347227/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_9.00.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jGcsGf"&gt;After first proposing it in 2017, Google has received unanimous approval from the San Jose City Council to move forward with its &lt;a href="https://realestate.withgoogle.com/sanjose/"&gt;Downtown West development&lt;/a&gt; plan, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/google-cleared-to-build-multi-billion-dollar-megacampus-in-san-jose.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company and city have reached an agreement to develop around 80 acres of land in downtown San Jose, California that will also serve as a mixed-use residential, retail, and open space for Google employees and the city’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roJhnj"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c38bcfdcc8fedd5ba4ecc1d/t/60a29a1210bcf63b5c1caec9/1621269033923/%28i%29+Ordinance+-+Downtown+West+Development+Agreement+-+051421.pdf"&gt;the proposed development agreement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Google will construct 7.3 million square feet of office space and 4,000 housing units, 1,000 of which are being explicitly set aside as affordable housing. Along with 50,000 square feet devoted to retail and cultural space, the company also plans to build hotel rooms and “short-term residences” for visiting corporate guests. Google detailed some of these plans as renders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508416/google-gigantic-san-jose-campus-downtown-west"&gt;in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but this is just a portion of its West Coast real estate expansion. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/03/18/google-launches-billion-dollar-california-property-investment-plan-for-2021/"&gt;futuristic new developments in Mountain View and Sunnyvale&lt;/a&gt; are already under construction, and a huge New York office space &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144448/google-nyc-campus-hudson-square-location-cost-open-date"&gt;in Hudson Square&lt;/a&gt; is also underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NzQrPeIVeUN6ZCaxSu23ULhZczw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21947236/Screen_Shot_2020_10_08_at_4.10.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/TUvYaP4YT00?t=139" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVEOv"&gt;Construction on Downtown West could start as early as next year but could take anywhere from 10 to 30 years to be completed. The timing of the project’s approval is complicated by how the pandemic has influenced the company’s general thinking on work. CEO Sundar Pichai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; a new flexible work policy for post-pandemic life that expects 60 percent of Google employees to only spend three days in the office, with some 20 percent of the company’s staff to work fully remotely from home. It seems reasonable to wonder if a dramatic expansion of office space makes sense if Google plans to use less of it than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To0gUK"&gt;There’s also the question of how much Google’s proposed affordable housing will actually help. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683827/google-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-1-billion-investment-sf-bay-area"&gt;committed $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to solving the California housing problem it played a role in creating, but price always remains a concern. San Jose, like large swaths of California, is not exactly a cheap place to live. Last year, the city was rated &lt;a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/2/18/21142384/san-jose-hardest-home-market-realtor-inventory-2020"&gt;the hardest city in the US to buy a home&lt;/a&gt;, with a median home price of $1.1 million. The situation is equally bad for renters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z0UsM"&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://reports.nlihc.org/gap/2019/ca"&gt;National Low Income Housing Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (NLHIC) found that San Jose was also severely lacking in affordable housing. For the 57,375 renter households the NLIHC counted, there were also only 16,825 affordable and available rental homes. With those numbers in mind, Google’s addition of 1,000 affordable homes seems minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5ZoOG"&gt;Activists and San Jose residents staged protests &lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/google-san-jose-protest-land-sale/4835078/"&gt;at the very first Council meeting&lt;/a&gt; to discuss selling the land to Google in 2018. Their basic worry was that Google’s development could price out current tenants in the area. The San Jose Sharks hockey team also threatened to sue Google and the city of San Jose if it wasn’t guaranteed parking for the next-door SAP Arena. Google ultimately agreed to 2,850 parking spaces and offered the team final approval on other infrastructure changes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/25/in-about-face-san-jose-sharks-settle-over-concerns-about-googles-downtown-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Jose Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MzTyc"&gt;Google has made &lt;a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/planning-building-code-enforcement/planning-division/projects-of-high-interest/google-project"&gt;concessions and adjustments&lt;/a&gt; along the way to approval, and at least claims to want Downtown West to be a part of San Jose, rather than just some extension of its campus. How that ultimately shakes out will depend on how the development affects San Jose’s most vulnerable, rather than Google’s own workers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is holding an Xbox and Bethesda showcase on June 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2cv8nkJuL9XFeK9XPEfjWfvAiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346862/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6nO3f"&gt;Microsoft’s big E3 event to showcase upcoming Xbox and Bethesda games will kick off on Sunday, June 13th at 1PM ET. It will be a 90-minute show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NxMId"&gt;“The show will be focused on games from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and many game creators from our partners around the world,” Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox games marketing, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/26/join-us-for-the-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6pFlt9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re thrilled to announce the Xbox &amp;amp; Bethesda Games Showcase will be Sunday, June 13. Tune-in details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP"&gt;https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxBethesda?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxBethesda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1397628674757652485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onU3XU"&gt;Microsoft completed its huge acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, so this event will be the first opportunity to see what the two companies have been cooking up together. The acquisition doesn’t mean that all Bethesda games are now Xbox exclusives — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from Bethesda-owned Arkane Studios, is debuting on PS5 and PC — but Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has already said that “some new titles in the future” will only be coming to Xbox and the company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He6KfM"&gt;There are a lot of potential titles that could be on display during the June showcase. We could get our next look at &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; following its &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/craig-the-halo-infinite-brute"&gt;rough showing last July&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;subsequent delay to this year&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;It’s set to launch in the fall&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt; seems tantalizingly close to release, especially after a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeluwz3g64A"&gt;recent update video posted by developer Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, so we might get some news about the long-in-the-works sequel. Microsoft announced upcoming new titles in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335535/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-windows-10-trailer-game-pass-rpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21332876/forza-motorsport-xbox-series-x-trailer-4k-60fps-ray-tracing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series last year, so we may hear more about those games and other titles revealed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21331849/xbox-series-x-games-event-trailers-gameplay-announcements-microsoft"&gt;last summer’s Xbox showcase&lt;/a&gt;. And from Bethesda, fingers crossed we’ll finally learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile is offering customers an Android 11 phone for $35</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a1_2zLWm3xpWkXsv4WjEKXFW2s=/0x1:2353x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346801/WikoRide3_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiko Ride 3 offers a 6.09-inch display and Android 11 out of the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wiko Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5umbsn"&gt;With T-Mobile’s older CDMA network shutdown looming and no sign of a delay in sight, Boost Mobile customers looking for a new 4G phone just got a very affordable new option: the Wiko Ride 3. It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fphones%2Fwiko-ride-3.html%3Fid16%3Dwiki&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22454954%2Fwiko-ride-3-boost-mobile-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently marked down to $34.99&lt;/a&gt; from a full retail price of $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OATL1x"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/boost-mobile-wiko-ride-3-affordable-android-11-phone-specs-features-price_id132374"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that promotional pricing somewhat unusually applies to existing customers rather than new ones. It’s unusual but not unexpected: the CDMA network shutdown could leave many Boost customers in need of a new phone. These customers might also start shopping around for a new carrier, so Boost has some extra incentive to offer current customers a good deal. Meanwhile, anyone switching from another carrier can get the Wiko Ride 3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CP3Th"&gt;It’s not unheard of to find a phone at this price, especially through MVNOs, but they’re often refurbished devices or run a previous Android OS generation. The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box — the current generation, at least for a little while longer, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; arrives this fall. Other specs include a 6.09-inch 720p screen, 13-megapixel main camera, and a 3,400mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9E1FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XR6uB1"&gt;Boost Mobile was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired by Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; as part of last year’s T-Mobile / Sprint merger deal, and it operates on T-Mobile’s networks — including an older 3G CDMA network that Dish says many Boost customers still rely on. T-Mobile plans to shut down this network at the beginning of 2022; Dish contends the shutdown is earlier than expected, calling it an anti-competitive move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;could leave many of its customers without service&lt;/a&gt; and accusing T-Mobile of trying to poach those customers in the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJ582"&gt;Dish has called on federal and state governments to intervene and delay the shutdown, but in the meantime, it appears to be stocking up on low-cost options for customers who may soon need a new 4G device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZAQhH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook plans to bury users who regularly share misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kLvjgNn5zefVlN4UjxHj2IWVt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346740/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHwOYH"&gt;In Facebook’s protracted efforts to be remembered as something other than the largest misinformation megaphone in history, it’s employed a number of strategies, from spinning its own misleading PR narratives to actual UI changes. Today, it announced a new tactic: not only will posts with misinformation in them be made less visible, but so will the individual users who share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWlqht"&gt;For several years, the social giant has plugged away at fact-checking partnerships meant to disincentivize the spread of viral misinformation, using the results of those checks to label offending posts rather than removing them. In some cases, it’s taken small steps toward hiding things that are found to be false or polarizing — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-suspended-group-recommendations-election"&gt;ending recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for political groups, for instance, during the 2020 election. Users, however, were free to post whatever they wanted with no consequences to speak of. No longer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvXAGxznKAmZg7RvmwYdVKasv8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541344/01_Inline_False_InfoLearn_More.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oIVr7j"&gt;“Starting today, we will reduce the distribution of all posts in News Feed from an individual’s Facebook account if they repeatedly share content that has been rated by one of our fact-checking partners,” the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/taking-action-against-people-who-repeatedly-share-misinformation/"&gt;wrote in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. While demonstrably false posts are already demoted in the News Feed rankings, users who share misinformation regularly will now see all of their content pushed down the dashboard’s endless scroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxP0Ci"&gt;It remains to be seen exactly what the tangible impact of this expanded enforcement will be. While individual Facebook users were previously immune to this sort of scrutiny, Instagram users were not. Nevertheless, vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90612612/instagram-anti-vaccine-misinformation-problem"&gt;has proliferated&lt;/a&gt; on the photo-sharing app. No matter how sophisticated its systems, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-slumlord-1837375095"&gt;as I’ve argued before&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is simply too large to monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n23fsc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV 4K (2021) review: much better remote, slightly faster box</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new chip and some futureproofing, but no huge changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NA4uQ5"&gt;It’s easy to be underwhelmed by the new Apple TV 4K. It looks identical to Apple’s first 4K streaming box introduced back in 2017, and the day-to-day experience of using it doesn’t feel dramatically better when compared to that device. The biggest improvement is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;the redesigned second-generation Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; that comes bundled with the new Apple TV 4K — but you can buy that separately for $59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEtUqm"&gt;Those who have long sung the Apple TV’s praises will find more to like with this updated hardware. It now has Wi-Fi 6 for speedier, more robust wireless performance. (A gigabit ethernet jack remains on the back for wired connectivity.) Apple has also built in support for Thread, the smart home networking protocol that will &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; be widely supported across the industry — even if it’s good for relatively little right now. The biggest internal change in the latest model is an upgraded chipset: Apple has moved on from the A10X Fusion to the A12 Bionic. But the A12 is far from Apple’s latest and greatest silicon; it first appeared in the iPhone XS line in 2018 and is still currently used in the entry-level iPad and iPad Mini. It’s an improvement, but not some game-changer for Apple’s set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iLMSp1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10519883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxET4M"&gt;On the outside, the Apple TV 4K is impossible to distinguish from its predecessor. It’s still the same nondescript black box that calls little attention to itself on a TV stand. I wish Apple would have done away with the glossy, dust-magnet sides, but we’re not so lucky. The company is sticking with the traditional set-top box form factor even as many competitors have moved to more discreet HDMI dongles that are usually hidden from view behind the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQl3xb"&gt;There have also been more subtle technical improvements that aren’t being advertised, but it’s the type of stuff video nerds will notice. Apple has mostly resolved an issue with &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/apple-tv-4k-raised-dolby-vision-black-levels-fixed-on-2021-model-near-black-sdr-flickering.3183975/"&gt;raised blacks in Dolby Vision content&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3fH-v9NwKQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDTVTest’s&lt;/em&gt; Vincent Teoh&lt;/a&gt;. However, the 2021 Apple TV 4K still doesn’t support bitstream audio passthrough, so the company hasn’t addressed all the wants of home theater enthusiasts. But it’s still checking off the essentials like Dolby Vision, Atmos, and HDR10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgrrI1"&gt;The tvOS software experience is identical between this Apple TV 4K and its predecessor. Navigating through menus and Siri voice searches both come with an extra dash of speed, and apps seem to load faster than before. But the differences are often marginal; the 2017 Apple TV 4K still holds up well today in terms of performance. That’s largely because tvOS is very polished at this point, and it doesn’t cheapen the viewing experience with in-your-face ads or sponsored content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still a basic grid of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWcyDj"&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still the same old static grid of apps, and Apple does what it can to steer you into using its Apple TV app, which aggregates TV shows and movies from numerous services and is also where you’ll find Apple TV Plus originals. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; is coming back soon, in case Apple hasn’t hammered that message into your brain enough already. The Apple TV app is fine and more than competent at recommendations (provided you aren’t looking for anything from Netflix), but aside from the Apple TV Plus section, it hasn’t changed a whole lot and feels stuck in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJPTKZ"&gt;Thankfully, Apple has evolved and added to tvOS elsewhere in recent years with new features like multiuser support, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and HomePod home theater audio. Speaking of which, the new Apple TV 4K lets you play audio through any HDMI device through the original HomePod. I don’t have Apple’s speakers around to try this myself, but early reports suggest that ARC audio works fine for video content. However, latency might be a dealbreaker if you attempt gaming with HomePods as speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKksQG"&gt;Another new trick of tvOS that’s also available on older Apple TV devices is an automatic calibration feature that uses your iPhone’s camera to process color patterns on-screen and adjust the image to make it look as good as possible. This doesn’t actually alter any of your TV’s settings; the Apple TV is optimizing its own picture settings, and you can toggle between this calibrated “balanced” result and the default to see the difference. The consensus seems to be that Apple’s feature can lead to improvements — often producing a warmer image — though most higher-end TVs come with accurate settings out of the box, especially in cinema or calibrated mode. If you’re serious about picture quality, it’s worth doing a legitimate calibration to get the best outcome across all of your TV’s various inputs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Apple TV 4K looks identical to the first model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCFbWZ"&gt;As before, the second-gen Apple TV 4K can serve as &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057"&gt;a hub for your HomeKit accessories&lt;/a&gt;; having a hub lets you control those devices remotely when you’re out of the house. When you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; home, you can quickly access smart home gadgets or pull up camera feeds on-screen with a voice command on the Apple TV 4K. Apple has also included Thread, a wireless communication standard developed specifically for smart home purposes, in the new Apple TV 4K, allowing it to be a hub for Thread devices to connect to and access the internet through. Thread should lead to more reliable connections and faster response times between devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;that support the protocol&lt;/a&gt;; Apple also built it into the HomePod Mini, and it’s the basis of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;forthcoming multiplatform Matter standard&lt;/a&gt;. But other tricks that were once selling points of the Apple TV, like AirPlay, can now be found on many smart TVs and even Roku devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cmMRnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10519994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5sVw"&gt;Video streams on the Apple TV 4K still deliver exceptional quality, but some of the frustrations we mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;nearly four years ago&lt;/a&gt; still remain present in tvOS today. Apple has long enabled the box to match the dynamic range and frame rate of playing content, but not all apps have taken advantage of this feature. So if your preference in video settings is Dolby Vision with dynamic range matching enabled, you’ll still encounter some situations where SDR content looks unappealing due to forced HDR processing. (There’s also a strange bug on the new Apple TV 4K where &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/new-apple-tv-4k-lists-hd-content-incorrectly/"&gt;some movies are being labeled as “HD”&lt;/a&gt; — even when it’s very clear that a 4K file is being streamed.) Setting tvOS to SDR by default with matching enabled leads to the best outcome, though YouTube annoyingly doesn’t flip over to HDR if you do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtY08y"&gt;Live TV integration with Siri remains &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204181"&gt;limited to a frustratingly small list of providers and apps&lt;/a&gt;, though at least ESPN is there. I’d love to see tvOS offer deeper support for live TV apps like Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu with Live TV beyond including them in single sign-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT0KeV"&gt;One argument that Apple TV owners frequently make in support of the hardware’s premium cost is that they appreciate Apple’s stringent privacy policies. The new App Tracking Transparency feature recently introduced on iOS is also present in tvOS. And let me tell you, the number of apps that ask for tracking privileges is quite eye-opening. It feels like on this platform more than any other, I’ve been bombarded with the pop-up asking me whether an app has permission to track me across other apps and websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYDJbs"&gt;Here’s just a sampling of streaming apps that have shown it so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nOHf4q"&gt;ABC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nxWrFa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WnaYq3"&gt;CNN Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LD0XAT"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KPeaw"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rt9lzV"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DINq8N"&gt;Fox Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nZD87l"&gt;FX Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XWaKfB"&gt;Hulu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IAH4mx"&gt;Nat Geo TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6uFgBN"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0Nidx"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3zLxsT"&gt;TBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5ksAd"&gt;TNT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw2xyJ"&gt;In my experience, Apple doesn’t sync up your chosen preference between iOS and tvOS when it comes to ATT. I’m getting the prompts &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; for all these streaming apps after already having seen them on my iPhone. It’s almost like Apple wants to emphasize how common tracking and data sharing has become among popular streaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1wwNB"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K has been outfitted with an HDMI 2.1 port, but it’s fair to say that Apple isn’t leveraging the full potential of that upgrade. If you’ve been following the next-gen console hype over the last year, you know that the latest Xbox consoles and PlayStation 5 are capable of high frame rates up to 120fps. The Apple TV 4K, meanwhile, tops out at 60fps HDR. Apple still considers this “high frame rate,” and it does lend a noticeable fluidity to sports, nature documentaries, and other videos that were originally shot at higher frame rates. (YouTube now supports 60fps on Apple TV 4K as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGyVX"&gt;However, that 60fps ceiling is a bummer for games on the platform. No one’s realistically expecting the Apple TV 4K to square off against the latest home consoles or come anywhere close, but 120Hz can still make a difference in responsiveness for titles with simpler graphics. On the subject of games, it’s worth noting that the new Siri Remote can’t be used as a controller like the previous one could; you’ve got to use a third-party gamepad now. The latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers are supported (with haptics included), and tvOS also works with a wide mix of others. It’s overall an improvement if you really want to play games on an Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has redesigned the Siri Remote, which is now larger and much easier to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz3gER"&gt;I covered the new Siri Remote in its own review, but since it comes bundled with the Apple TV 4K, here’s a summary: it’s very, very good. The larger, thicker design is easier to handle (and more difficult to lose), and the circular D-pad will prove more intuitive for a lot of the people who were perplexed by the trackpad on the old remote. The center button still lets you navigate in the same way by nudging your thumb around, but if you liked the large gesture area on the original Siri Remote, this one might feel more limiting. On the whole, I think Apple absolutely made the right move in changing up the design. It’s dramatically simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmz4ZF"&gt;One feature I continue to wish the Apple TV 4K offered is spatial audio for AirPods owners. Being able to have a private bubble of surround sound when watching the biggest screen in your home seems like it could be a visceral experience. I know there are technical challenges and the Apple TV doesn’t have the same sensors as an iPhone or iPad, but I’m hopeful Apple will bring spatial audio to the platform at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4r7YfRKNF6gfIOg1Om2Om31FAds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541102/DSCF3896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K is expensive, but it delivers a top-notch streaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w9u8HW"&gt;If you have the original Apple TV 4K, there’s really no sensible reason to upgrade to the new one. Wi-Fi 6 is nice to have, and Thread might prove important to the smart home someday, but that time isn’t now. Otherwise, you’re getting a slightly faster experience than what the old box is capable of. Just buy the Siri Remote, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z1xYTu"&gt;But if you’re coming from something older or the wildly overpriced Apple TV HD, the proposition is the same as always: you can get a very good 4K streaming gadget for a fraction of the Apple TV 4K’s price. But it’s unlikely to offer the same user experience or reliable performance. Or maybe some apps won’t support Dolby Vision or Atmos to the same degree they do on Apple TV. The Apple TV 4K is still overpriced, but it’s also still arguably the best streaming experience you’ll find in a single box — especially if you’re entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem. Does this new hardware feel like a true upgrade or big leap from the 2017 Apple TV 4K? No, not really. But at least they got the remote right. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andy Jassy will become Amazon’s CEO on July 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZU304oBOav2JOxI9cphu6TSPso=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346383/670451728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q0mEM5"&gt;Andy Jassy will officially become the CEO of Amazon on July 5th, the company announced at a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The company picked that date because it marks 27 years to the day that Amazon was incorporated, according &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dee_bosa/status/1397604817879674882?s=20"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1397604693182795776"&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; who transcribed remarks from outgoing CEO Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYBJaQ"&gt;Amazon announced that Jassy, who is the current CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), would replace Bezos as CEO of the entire company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos will become executive chair of Amazon’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B31r1"&gt;“As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and my other passions,” Bezos said &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=f6bcd4df-67a6-55b3-d4e&amp;amp;tag=curbedcom06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w50"&gt;in a statement in February&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW8geF"&gt;Jassy is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;one of the most important executives&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon’s history, having led the hugely successful AWS — the cloud computing technology that underpins Netflix, Spotify, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and other major services — to astronomical heights. He joined the company in the late ’90s and was tasked with exploring what would become AWS around 2003. Since then, it has become a massive revenue-driver for the company, earning $13.5 billion &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;last quarter&lt;/a&gt; alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XJKNPf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="19VJyy"&gt;Jassy is taking the helm of Amazon at a time of significant change and continued growth. Earlier today, Amazon announced that it would be buying film and TV company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a huge set of entertainment assets that could help bolster its Amazon Prime Video offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olk3au"&gt;But the company’s massive size and market power have also put it in the spotlight for intense scrutiny from all sides. The DC attorney general launched an antitrust suit against Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453125/dc-attorney-general-amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-favored-nation"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company was accused of antitrust violations in the EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327284/eu-investigation-amazon-alexa-google-assistant-apple-siri-internet-of-things-wearables"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22234684/new-lawsuit-accuses-amazon-e-book-price-fixing"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352990/new-york-california-ftc-amazon-investigation-marketplace"&gt;probes&lt;/a&gt; at the state and federal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geROoO"&gt;And Amazon employees are making increased demands of company leadership, including calling for Bezos and Jassy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;to support Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;stop polluting near communities of color&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also dealing with the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a contentious union drive in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and although employees ultimately failed to secure the necessary votes to form a union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is contesting the results &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423366/amazon-union-election-appeal-hearing"&gt;in an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLEy2K"&gt;It seems likely that Jassy as CEO will run the company much like Bezos has been, given his long tenure at the company and as a Bezos’ lieutenant for years. But Jassy’s experience making AWS the giant it is today seems to indicate that he’s well-suited for the role — now we’ll just have to see what he does when he takes the top job on July 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
