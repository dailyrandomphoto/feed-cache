    <title>The US government will pay you up to $500,000 to design a less annoying face mask </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGLgK4"&gt;Over a year into the pandemic, we’ve seen a wide variety of masks, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21318991/etsy-mesh-masks-coronavirus-poor-protection"&gt;totally unsafe fashion pieces&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;RGB nightmares&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention a bunch of other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22174639/masks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19"&gt;stylish options&lt;/a&gt;. But if you think you might have an idea for a better mask that more people might want to wear, the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) &lt;a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mask-innovation-challenge/"&gt;has announced a competition&lt;/a&gt; to design “the next generation of masks” — with a potential $500,000 total prize waiting for the winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR33zk"&gt;The Mask Innovation Challenge was created in partnership with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, an organization under the CDC) to address some of the common complaints leveled at masks, like the fact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301830/face-mask-glasses-fogging-how-to-stop-clear"&gt;they can fog up glasses&lt;/a&gt;, irritate your skin, become uncomfortable to wear, get in the way of communication, and potentially let COVID-19 particles in through the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QNgjcD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Masks may stick around even after everyone’s vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="plMKIp"&gt;The contest will have two phases. The first phase, focused on “design,” is split into two tracks, one that considers redesigns of existing masks, and another that’s focused on new technologies and materials. Submissions are supposed to include actual schematics for building the proposed masks, which NIOSH says may be tested in the future as well. Phase One will produce up to 10 winners, each of whom will receive $10,000 to help build a prototype of their masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTK3Du"&gt;The second “proof-of-concept” phase will require contestants to respond to a hypothetical scenario with a brand-new mask design, not based on any existing mask. Phase two entrants will submit physical prototypes of their masks for NIOSH to test. Up to five winners from phase two will split a total prize pool of $400,000. NIOSH and BARDA say more details on the second phase will be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi3oyx"&gt;Holding a design contest to find a “better” mask could produce some real solutions, but beyond that, I think it reflects &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/will-masks-become-the-new-normal-even-after-the-pandemic-has-passed-some-americans-say-so-.html"&gt;the increased role masks may play&lt;/a&gt; in our lives, even after a majority of people are vaccinated. And that’s not to say that the masks you may already own aren’t effective; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html"&gt;they are&lt;/a&gt;. There are really multiple problems getting in the way of mask use; addressing complaints in mask design is one direction, but another big issue is availability. Masks manufacturers aren’t yet able to consistently meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgW9ya"&gt;For instance, it’s still not as easy as it should be to get N95s and KN95s, two frequently recommended masks that offer a step up in filtration from cloth varieties. There’s a lot at play here too; the long term effects of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decades-offshoring-led-mask-shortage-pandemic/"&gt;offshoring medical supplies manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; have impacted availability, but so have shortages of key mask making materials &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/covid-n95-medical-mask-shortage-manufacturing/"&gt;like meltblown textile&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also the separate issue of counterfeit masks. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 60 percent of KN95s in the US aren’t as effective at filtering COVID-19 particles as their labels might indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReZDpA"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22240453/joe-biden-defense-production-act-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;has set plans into motion&lt;/a&gt; to force the creation of more essential pandemic supplies and alleviate some of these issues, but it’s important to remember that building a better mask is just one facet of a much larger strategy. There’s no guarantee more people will wear the winning masks just because they don’t fog up their glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLN2Y1"&gt;The deadline for submission to phase one of &lt;a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mask-innovation-challenge/"&gt;the Mask Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; is April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flight Penguin is a new flight search Chrome app that promises ‘no collusion’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIcf7nLy-zJBBC-yjntUfKO-Pu0=/204x0:963x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081000/33t687fbfzy4vdol.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4mY874"&gt;The founders of Hipmunk are launching a new startup today that’s aimed squarely at taking on their own former product. Called &lt;a href="https://flightpenguin.com/"&gt;Flight Penguin&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a Chrome browser extension that simultaneously searches a bunch of airline websites and then presents the results in a familiar format. Rather than taking a commission or affiliate fee, Flight Penguin will instead charge its users $10 per month — it’s designed for people who travel a lot (or, since there’s still a pandemic on, people who will imminently travel a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGhJMw"&gt;Flight Penguin is also not pulling any punches when it comes to its rhetoric: it promises that there will be “no collusion” with the airline industry, specifically noting that “Some of the largest travel sites hide flights from you in exchange for special favors from airlines.” The site is also gunning for Kayak, saying it will put that search “on ice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azebjx"&gt;Hipmunk was a beloved site for travelers in its day, making it easy to compare flight costs across different airlines. Flight Penguin’s spiky stance toward other travel sites and toward the airline industry itself is likely meant to appeal to the people who used the travel site before it was shut down last year. The stance also positions Flight Penguin as a kind of super tool for travelers in the know — at launch users will have to sign up for a waitlist to even try it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJELmV"&gt;To use Flight Penguin, you click on the extension in your Chrome browser tool bar and enter your search terms — it can handle one-way and round-trip searches for now. Hit enter, and you’ll watch a timer wheel spin for a minute or so. While that wheel spins, the extension is searching airline sites for you in the background and then organizing the results. You can sort by price, timing, or by “pain” — Flight Penguin’s term for a mix of characteristics like price, layovers, timing, etc. At launch, Flight Penguin will also let you search for flights you can pay for with Chase rewards points. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3JpJ8kA1YldjkAFSKhebPYjIuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422984/unnamed.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClytRL"&gt;In some sample searches during a demo, I saw some results that wouldn’t have been likely to appear on other flight search sites — including results from airlines I didn’t expect and results that mixed airlines that typically wouldn’t go together. In a search trying to go from Oakland to Shreveport, for example, it came up with an itinerary that combined Sprit and Allegiant which was significantly cheaper than other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJS5VX"&gt;Adam Goldstein and Steve Huffman (better known &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155845/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-tiktok-privacy-concerns-spyware-fingerprinting-tracking-users"&gt;now as the CEO of Reddit&lt;/a&gt;) are the only two investors — both were founders of Hipmunk back in the day. Goldstein left Hipmunk in 2018 some time after it was purchased by Concur, which shut down the &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-concur-shuts-down-travel-search-engine-hipmunk/"&gt;consumer version of Hipmunk just before the pandemic hit last year&lt;/a&gt;. The entire Flight Penguin team consists of three people — the extension itself is largely coded by another Hipmunk expat, Sheri Zada. “I don’t need this to be a huge company,” Goldstein says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFrdlm"&gt;Goldstein says that after he and Huffman saw Hipmunk was shutting down, they wanted to create a flight search tool “with less headache, with less dependence on backroom dealing.” He says that they call it the “no collusion philosophy” and that his company does not have any relationships with airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzQTFc"&gt;It’s not exactly surprising that there aren’t deals with airlines, because what seems to be happening behind the scenes is that the browser extension is essentially scraping the search results on each individual airline’s website. Because it’s a browser extension, to the websites it looks like a normal user doing a normal search, when in fact it’s the Chrome extension clicking the buttons and filling in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gw140PkWZou7Sx6zJMvZd57lQtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422298/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_12.22.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ1Bbi"&gt;Putting an entire flight search service inside a Chrome extension is clever, but it does require a level of trust in the company. Depending on how it’s written, a Chrome extension can gather a significant amount of information about your browsing habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SePmX"&gt;Goldstein says his company will not collect or share any use data beyond what’s necessary to get payment information for the subscription (and some basic analytics). You can see its &lt;a href="https://subscribe.flightpenguin.com/privacy"&gt;privacy policy here&lt;/a&gt;. Since it’s a subscription service, he also says that Flight Penguin takes no commissions and will show no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jdZkL"&gt;We’ll need to kick the tires on the service ourselves before we can say if it’s any good. One big question looming over the entire enterprise is whether the airline industry will do anything (either technically or legally) to try to block the Flight Penguin extension from gathering search results from their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest budget phones ask: is refresh rate more important than resolution?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuFrMXoqVwLqUN3dC0KTspxBkuU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080845/galaxy_f12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="du4xVp"&gt;If you had to choose: would you choose a sharper screen on your smartphone, or a smoother-scrolling one? This year, budget phone buyers may be asking themselves that question: the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/oneplus-brings-a-90hz-smartphone-to-the-us-for-180/"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;Moto G50,&lt;/a&gt; and the new Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-fullonfab-galaxy-f12-with-true-48mp-quad-camera-and-90hz-display"&gt;Galaxy F12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-monsterreloaded-galaxy-m12-with-8nm-exynos-processor-and-90hz-display"&gt;M12&lt;/a&gt; all refresh their screens 90 times per second (which is good!) but with a lower-than-optimal screen resolution of 720p. That’s the same resolution as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review"&gt;Galaxy Nexus from 2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Liz9"&gt;Compared to your average iPhone, that’s a paltry number of pixels. Since the iPhone 4 debuted in 2010, every Apple handset has offered at least 326 pixels per inch (PPI), enough so you can’t make out those individual pixels with the naked eye at typical viewing distances. (The marketing term is “retina display.”) Here, the PPI would be more like 270. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i9AjxE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yj1go6OuZ4A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rxfEv"&gt;And yet Apple has never offered an iPhone with a high-refresh-rate screen, which we’ve often found to be one of the most desirable features on high-end and mid-range smartphones since it makes everything you do (not just games) feel much smoother. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Apple might make it happen later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk7ygU"&gt;But the Galaxy F12 and M12, the OnePlus and Moto all show that high-refresh doesn’t need to be a high-end feature at all, or even a $300 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;like we recently saw with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Samsung phones in particular cost under $150 each, as long as you’re willing to sacrifice pixels to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jlaiw"&gt;In other ways, the 9,999-rupee handsets seem like they might be decent picks too: they’re based on the same basic platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;as the Galaxy A12 and its four-camera array&lt;/a&gt;, but with a larger 6,000mAh battery that dwarfs many others on the market. You get a sidemounted fingerprint sensor. Just note while its 8nm Exynos 850 processor might sound shiny and new, it’s not comparable with Qualcomm’s recent 800-series Snapdragon chips. It’s closer to 2019’s Snapdragon 665 in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xibs7b"&gt;It’s not clear whether either of these phones will come to the US quite yet. The OnePlus Nord N100 already has, and the G50 launched in Europe late last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAN6mD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse’s new direct payments let you toss a coin to creators, and they get 100 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Surveillance Fears After Clubhouse App Takes Saudi By Storm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0GaFF7avwGqg9zlq5Ic6E4QXIM=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080758/1231631217.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YslMkG"&gt;Social audio app Clubhouse will let all users pay other creators starting Monday. It’s the first monetization tool built right into the app. Clubhouse says it won’t take a cut of payments, meaning that creators get the entirety of what somebody sends them. Not everyone will be able to &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; payments just yet, though; that will be rolling out in waves, “starting with a small test group,” &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/introducing-payments"&gt;Clubhouse says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXgsc8"&gt;To pay a Clubhouse creator who can receive payments, tap on their profile, then tap on the “Send Money” button, and then choose how much you send them. You’ll also have to pay a  “small card processing fee” that goes to Stripe, which is Clubhouse’s payments processing partner. The first time to try to pay someone, Clubhouse will ask you to add a credit or debit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DrY5y1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10430926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wrl4Wb"&gt;The news of direct payments comes a few weeks after Clubhouse announced its first creator accelerator program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"&gt;Clubhouse Creator First&lt;/a&gt;, which will take on 20 aspiring hosts and creators to help them build their audiences and monetize their shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP83j8"&gt;The accelerator and the new direct payments could give creators more incentive to stay on Clubhouse instead of jumping to one of the many other social media platforms that have copied &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Clubhouse’s social audio format&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Clubhouse is only available on iOS as an invite-only app, though an &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/"&gt;Android version is in the works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d6kabX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nQlw5k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Once again, someone tampered with an entire drinking water supply via the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTb389vr_q7sBL5g9c3njARfEO4=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079493/2012-10-09_10-32-34-1024.1349976126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLoBc6"&gt;You would think that something as critical as a town or county’s drinking water supply would be well-protected  — you know, like how America’s nuclear armament was isolated from the internet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931800/usa-nuclear-8-inch-floppy-disk-solid-state-transition"&gt;even relied on eight-inch floppy disks until just recently&lt;/a&gt;? And yet we’ve now had &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; instances where someone was able to remotely log into a municipal water supply in a way that could have harmed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofuTfj"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273170/hackers-water-treatment-facility-florida-hacked-chemical-levels-changed"&gt;the story of the Florida water treatment facility&lt;/a&gt; where someone was able to change the chemical levels? Something similar happened in March 2019 in Kansas’ Ellsworth County, too, where 22-year-old Wyatt Travnichek now stands accused of shutting down the region’s water cleaning system “with the intention of harming” it, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/indictment-kansas-man-indicted-tampering-public-water-system"&gt;a statement from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DHRtxy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maybe remote access shouldn’t be a feature of our nation’s drinking water supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9SvyY0"&gt;The wildest part is that in both cases, these municipalities left themselves wide open to tampering — they installed the remote access software themselves so employees could log in to monitor the systems! That’s what Travnichek was hired to do in Kansas, and authorities aren’t even accusing him of “hacking” the system &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20536881-travnichek-indictment"&gt;in their indictment&lt;/a&gt;. He simply “logged in remotely” months after he left the job, began shutting things down, and is now facing up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgJDk0"&gt;That sounds remarkably similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277300/florida-water-treatment-chemical-tamper-teamviewer-shared-password"&gt;what happened in Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where the water treatment plant never bothered to change the password or even remove an old piece of remote control software after they’d installed a newer one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzGhcn"&gt;Maybe we should stop doing that. President Joe Biden is currently trying to push &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;a $2 trillion infrastructure plan&lt;/a&gt;, including billions to deliver safe water and replace lead pipes, among &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362079/joe-biden-infrastructure-plan-abandoned-oil-gas-wells-mines"&gt;other hazards&lt;/a&gt;. To keep the water safe, we also need to keep the water secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzKHJf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/kansas-ellsworth-water-district-hack-travnichek/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;spoke to a customer service rep at the Kansas water utility, who claimed the incident didn’t harm residents’ drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Online-only Outriders can be paused in single-player — if you have an Nvidia GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYbXzUyWi1LBRVlgVGECf_6oUDE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079250/pv_02_s001_s001_t011_mov_02_55_57_22_still003_sCAdb67GRO.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: People Can Fly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVTDmn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;, the online shooting, looting, and superpower-slinging game from People Can Fly, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outriders/comments/mj3upt/pc_users_with_nvidia_gpus_can_pause_the_game/"&gt;finally has a way to pause&lt;/a&gt;, but to do it you’ll need to be using an Nvidia graphics card (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/solo-players-with-nivida-gpus-can-pause-always-online-o-1846616313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). &lt;/em&gt;Despite working as a single-player game, &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; requires an internet connection to play, which means pausing in the middle of a battle was impossible until this workaround. Even with your menu open, enemies could still attack you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iudg82"&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fansel-revolutionizing-game-screenshots%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368287%2Foutriders-destiny-square-enix-online-only-pause-singleplayer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ansel&lt;/a&gt;, which is a feature of Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards that enables a kind of photo mode even in games without one built in, you can “pause” &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;by pressing “Alt F2” on the fly, and get up and take care of business. Because Ansel is specific to the Nvidia’s Geforce Experience software, pausing is limited to PC players, which means anyone playing on console or with a different brand of graphics card is out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dPP5Zs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLkKwLx8Dw4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96BHb3"&gt;The handling of pausing and single-player content in &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is similar to &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which it shares some aesthetic and mechanical similarities. &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154809/destiny-2-paid-cosmetic-loot-boxes-fortnite-style-season-battle-pass-ending"&gt;sells a battle pass and yearly expansions&lt;/a&gt; with new story content, and it justifies — at least in part — it’s online-only requirements with the promise of new weekly and monthly changes in the form of live events and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZJYN1"&gt;The difference is that &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is very explicitly sold as a more traditional single-player game, with the game’s publisher Square Enix &lt;a href="https://outriders.square-enix-games.com/en-us/faq/"&gt;addressing the issue on its site&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is a complete experience out of the box,” it writes. For some reason, an internet connection is still required, which, beyond hindering a basic feature like pausing the game, also seemed to contribute to &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;’ launch on April 2nd being &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/outriders-launches-to-a-day-of-server-problems-like-ev-1846608910"&gt;kind of a mess&lt;/a&gt;. Players had issues connecting with the game’s servers to play in single-player and multiplayer, for which developer People Can Fly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1378075633553715216"&gt;acknowledged and apologized publicly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ma7VWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To All Players: &lt;a href="https://t.co/xBpcc6g9T1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xBpcc6g9T1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— People Can Fly (@PCFPeopleCanFly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1378075633553715216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6UApmH"&gt;The game &lt;a href="https://status.outriders.net/"&gt;seems to be working fine now&lt;/a&gt;, and this weird Nvidia loophole means the experience of playing single-player could be a little bit more comfortable, but &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; definitely illustrates the ongoing problems of making a game online-only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2jLXx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mUBDm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yahoo Answers will be shut down forever on May 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yahoo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/suf1NGVTbFtyM2yYdXDr9h01svQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079195/yahoo-stock-1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L46G59"&gt;Yahoo Answers, one of the longest-running and most storied web Q&amp;amp;A platforms in the history of the internet, is shutting down on May 4th. That’s the day the Yahoo Answers website will start redirecting to the Yahoo homepage, and all of the platform’s archives will apparently cease to exist. The platform has been operating since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCC9fp"&gt;Yahoo, which is now part of Verizon Media Group following the company’s sale to the telecom for nearly $5 billion in 2017, &lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/"&gt;announced the change&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the Yahoo Answers homepage. The message links to an &lt;a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which details the timeline of the shutdown. Starting April 20th, the platform will no longer accept new submissions, the FAQ explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKfTs5"&gt;Users will also have until June 30th to request their data or it’ll be inaccessible after that. That includes “all user-generated content including your Questions list, Questions, Answers list, Answers, and any images,” Yahoo says, but  “you won’t be able to download other users’ content, questions, or answers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NpFfM"&gt;A note sent to active Yahoo Answers members provides a little more detail as to why Yahoo is shutting down the platform, including that “it has become less popular over the years” and that the company “decided to shift our resources away” from the product to “focus on products that better serve our members.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yARHGy"&gt;Dear Yahoo Answers Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Qab4e"&gt;We launched Yahoo Answers sixteen years ago to help people around the world connect and share information. With you and millions of other users, we built the best place on the web to ask and answer questions on a variety of topics, creating a community of global knowledge sharing. While we could not have been prouder of what we accomplished together, we are reaching out today to let you know that we have decided to shut down Yahoo Answers on May 4th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJya6d"&gt;While Yahoo Answers war once a key part of Yahoo’s products and services, it has become less popular over the years as the needs of our members have changed. To that end, we have decided to shift our resources away from Yahoo Answers to focus on products that better serve our members and deliver on Yahoo’s promise of providing premium trusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qe50Q8"&gt;Starting on April 20th you will no longer be able to post any new questions or answers. However, you can still view any posted questions and answers until May 4th. On May 4th the site will be shutting down. If you would like to download a copy of your questions and answers you have posted, you can do this by signing into &lt;em&gt;Your Privacy Dashboard&lt;/em&gt; and requesting a download. You will be able to do this until June 30th, 2021 after which your Yahoo Answers data will be securely deleted and no longer available. The closure of Yahoo Answers will not affect your Yahoo account or other Yahoo services. For further information and instructions on how to download your data, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions or copy and paste this URL into your browser: &lt;a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html"&gt;https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1pZ1U"&gt;Thank you for contributing to Yahoo Answers — we’re proud and honored to have helped you connect with and learn from the Yahoo community these past sixteen years. If you’d like to provide feedback, please feel free to reach out to our team at &lt;a href="mailto:yahoo_answers_sunset@verizonmedia.com"&gt;yahoo_answers_sunset@verizonmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar8YYi"&gt;Sincerely, The Yahoo Answers team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dkRUEK"&gt;Perhaps the shutdown is for the best, considering the site appears to be overrun with far-right conspiratorial garbage. The current Yahoo Answers homepage is highlighting such introspective gems in its discover section as, “Will America survive 4 years of Joe Biden?” and “Will this summer be record riots by BLM and antifa?,” as well as this instant classic, “Was Stalin right about everything?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEQrJO"&gt;May all the wayward souls of Yahoo Answers now find the information they’re looking for somewhere more credible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Nintendo Switch is so big you can actually read the text in Skyrim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CELyoHr4zWJ0uhayoyE3bELERMA=/259x0:2185x1284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078886/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_2.23.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOZ1TM"&gt;Nintendo has been rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;working on a bigger Switch&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, which reportedly could show up later in 2021. But YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCao3Nt6sXkRZc851f6wHmkg"&gt;Michael Pick&lt;/a&gt; isn’t waiting around for a new model from Nintendo — he’s gone and built his own bigger Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fljYuR"&gt;Much bigger, as it turns out: almost six feet wide, compared to the regular Switch’s 9.4-inch size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhWh5z"&gt;“I really like the Nintendo Switch. It’s small, it’s portable — but it’s really easy to lose. And for me, that was a problem. So, I decided to fix that by making something that was just a little bit larger,” Pick said. That reads as a bit of an understatement when comparing Pick’s supersized model (which he says is the world’s largest) to the original. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWRbRgqBoxL-RaWFBKSOWZB8Z0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422135/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_2.23.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X5n8ZK"&gt;The gigantic version of the Switch is less a portable console and more of a fancy wooden frame for a 4K TV screen, with 3D-printed buttons and an actual (regular-sized) Switch hidden inside. To make the buttons work, a smaller Joy-Con controller is stowed inside with several servo motors that translate the presses on the big buttons to the actual hardware on the inside. The joysticks are even simpler: just massive, 3D-printed joysticks centered with rubber bands on top of the smaller Joy-Con joysticks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro4nOn"&gt;Of course, the massive custom Switch does lose out on some of the regular Switch’s portability: at 65 pounds, it’s not something that you’ll be able to carry around easily. And if one wanted to quibble, Pick’s Switch isn’t technically &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; functional, lacking both a touchscreen and removable Joy-Con controllers (making it more of a giant Switch Lite in practice than a giant standard Switch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdwlHz"&gt;Still, the lack of portability shouldn’t be too much of a problem, given that Pick is donating the custom console to the St. Jude Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic just made streaming Fortnite easier than ever with a new Houseparty integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIIB_FEzmd3sF8Hxg3-MuBo1FN8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078880/stream_fortnite_gameplay_to_houseparty_1280x720_224cb65f8d7c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ev6jux"&gt;Epic is further stitching together its various platforms with a new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; integration for its social video app Houseparty that &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;lets you stream your gameplay to friends&lt;/a&gt;. The integration builds on an existing one that uses Houseparty’s video chatting capabilities to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572069/fortnite-houseparty-video-chat-pc-ps4-ps5"&gt;bring live video chat into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now this essentially does the reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZg3qL"&gt;That way, your friends can see you live both through your mobile phone camera and also the feed of your active &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game. Think of it a bit like Twitch streaming without all the fuss and just for your friends instead of the broader public. Epic says the feature supports streaming from a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC right now. “We will let everyone know if we’re able to support more platforms in the future,” Epic says in its blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyjnh5"&gt;Epic owns Houseparty, which streamlines fast and easy group video chat, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;2019 acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and the game maker has used the app to boost the social feature sets of its various gaming platforms. A few months following the acquisition, Epic began using Houseparty for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871464/fortnite-voice-chat-party-hub-houseparty"&gt;improved &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;cross-platform audio chat&lt;/a&gt;, and now a full bridge between the game and the app exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJafX"&gt;For a breakdown of how to enable Houseparty gameplay streaming and video chat, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;check out Epic’s FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says some phones will get Android 12 updates, but we’re skeptical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9JLpHDS59marPNaKaSNPBQA6CU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078689/cwelch_200218_3910_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG V60 — launched in early 2020 — could be on the list for an Android 12 update.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYfu7t"&gt;LG says it will continue to offer Android OS updates — including an upgrade to Android 12 — for some of its devices after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;exits the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s poor track record has us feeling skeptical it’ll follow through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0SUJg"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fpress-release%2Flg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; and on a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fnotice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;, LG says only that it will continue to provide some security and OS updates, but a page on LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-android-12-update/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions that an “Android 12 OS upgrade will also be provided for selected models.” This page also notes that this is subject to change based on product performance, and that update availability may vary by region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8c6v05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0YSS5"&gt;LG US didn’t share anything more specific when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying only that “LG may offer certain OS upgrades for select models,” and that “additional details will be provided in the near future on software updates.” An Android 11 update schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed for the US either, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;details posted on LG’s German website&lt;/a&gt; could give a rough idea of what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDoIPb"&gt;Unfortunately, LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business; OS upgrades came slowly, even for flagship devices. In 2018, the company attempted to remedy this by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;setting up a Software Upgrade division&lt;/a&gt;, but when it came time to offer Android 9 Pie updates in early 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;not much had actually changed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOA9Cw"&gt;If the company does make good on its Android 12 promise, we expect that it would only come to a few high-profile devices, like the Wing and V60. And with Android 11 only scheduled to come to many of the company’s phones much later this year, even if that 12 update does come it’ll likely be a long ways off.&lt;/p&gt;
