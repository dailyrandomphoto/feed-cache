    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Workers claim HR did not take their complaints seriously&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N9PrIY"&gt;A group of former SpaceX employees are coming forward about their experience working at the commercial rocket company, claiming that there is a culture of sexual harassment in the workplace and that managers and the human resources department handled complaints poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic8Win"&gt;The individuals are speaking out in light of an &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/at-spacex-we-re-told-we-can-change-the-world-just-don-t-try-to-stop-the-sexual-harassment"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; published by one former employee, Ashley Kosak, who left SpaceX in November. In her account, Kosak details multiple instances of being groped and feeling uncomfortable after fending off sexual advances by her male co-workers. Four additional people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; described their own troubling experiences at SpaceX or witnessing other women and nonbinary people being harassed. In three cases reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, SpaceX HR was made aware of the allegations and had inconsistent responses that the employees felt were inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WriqV0"&gt;“SpaceX as an organization values the mission over employee wellness to the extent that I never saw meaningful action taken against individuals who committed acts of sexual harassment,” one former employee said, adding that she felt SpaceX’s lack of action was driven by management’s desire to avoid work disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LcSNK"&gt;Kosak decided to come forward publicly with her story in order to help others in the space industry realize that any harassment they might be experiencing should not be tolerated. “I think until someone finally says, ‘This is unacceptable,’ you find a way mentally to accept that it’s okay,” Kosak tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I hope that this essay helps bring to light that a lot of behaviors that are happening out there are not okay.” The essay was published in Lioness, a platform for whistleblowers to report on workplace misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Agv1dd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former employees also believe the company is reluctant to hold some men accountable for bad behavior&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBaS6B"&gt;In the essay, Kosak, who worked as a build reliability engineer in Cape Canaveral, Florida, alleges that a colleague grabbed her butt when she first started at the company and describes another incident where she says a different colleague ran his hand over her chest during a team bonding event. She claims that multiple men from the company would DM her and make sexual advances toward her, sometimes calling her in the middle of the night. One colleague apparently even came over to her house and tried to touch her multiple times, despite her pleas to stay professional. Kosak says she reported all of these incidents to either her superiors or to HR, but people rarely followed up on her complaints and her alleged perpetrators suffered no repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8Gb9u"&gt;Kosak also says she witnessed other women dealing with similar issues at SpaceX. “Some of the men who work at SpaceX hug women without consent, stare at women while they work, and interpret every social encounter as an opportunity to date (or hit on) women in the office,” Kosak wrote in the essay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1Myib"&gt;Though Kosak is the lone author on the essay, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with four additional people who used to work for SpaceX, all of whom claimed to have experienced similar types of treatment or witnessed other women and nonbinary people dealing with harassment at the company. These former employees agree that SpaceX is a bit of a “boys’ club,” as one former employee put it, and say they were part of a very small group of women and nonbinary people working at the company. That made them feel severely outnumbered. The former employees also believe the company is reluctant to hold some men accountable for bad behavior, especially if those men have put in a lot of time at SpaceX or have contributed great things to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pO8jhx"&gt;One woman who used to work as an intern at SpaceX, Julia CrowleyFarenga, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405671/spacex-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-former-intern"&gt;filed a lawsuit against the company in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that a manager retaliated against her after she reported harassment from one of her other managers, ultimately blocking her from being hired at SpaceX when her internship ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qUTvGs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All four of the women or nonbinary people in my room, separately, were harassed during our internships”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBCRBu"&gt;Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, described an instance during her internship when a senior SpaceX technician repeatedly tried to open her locked door and enter her room in internship housing, while he was demonstrably  intoxicated. Another former SpaceX intern said a male co-worker made inappropriate comments about their appearance and saw others experience similar behavior. “All four of the women or nonbinary people in my room, separately, were harassed during our internships,” the individual tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And that was a really upsetting experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cWEvD"&gt;SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations, nor did the company respond to a request for details about its sexual harassment policy. However this weekend, after Lioness reached out to the company about Kosak’s essay, Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, sent a company-wide email to SpaceX employees, reminding them of the company’s “no A-hole” policy and that harassment will not be tolerated. She also encouraged people to report any harassment they might experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GmahR"&gt;“Timely reporting of harassment is key to our maintaining SpaceX as a great place to work; we can’t fix what we don’t know,” Shotwell wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;If you are aware of, or experience any acts of harassment or discrimination, report it to your manager or any HR representative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BCrfw"&gt;The email also claims that SpaceX will be taking a closer look at its HR practices moving forward. “We also know we can always do better,” Shotwell wrote in the email. “That is why HR has been soliciting feedback from groups across the company to ensure the process is effective. HR will also conduct an internal audit, followed by a third-party audit.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZN6QHDdwGAX712oFKWtzKnbibVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087464/acastro_211214_4932_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="D1UNVI"&gt;In her essay, Kosak said she did meet with HR on a few occasions throughout her time with the company but says that no meaningful action was taken. She also says she presented HR with a proposed framework for addressing sexual harassment, one that told people how to report their harassment and the kinds of repercussions that employees who engage in inappropriate behavior might expect. However, there was never any meaningful follow-up on her proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTd6Kb"&gt;Finally, in October, she decided to submit an “anonymous” tip to the company’s Ethics and Compliance tip line, addressed to Gwynne Shotwell. In her tip, a copy of which was provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, she detailed her frustrations with HR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zV7uYC"&gt;I am reaching out to you because the HR department has done absolutely nothing to resolve these issues, and in cases where engineering leaders have come together to bring to HR the list of changes necessary, they forced us to [put] in over 10 hours of work updating their training.... then nothing happened. Then I got harassed. Then these people got promoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KaMUdg"&gt;The submission document for the tip was a Microsoft form, which ultimately revealed Kosak’s identity. Kosak says she then received a call from HR, confronting her about the allegations in the tip. During the call, which Kosak recorded and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, representatives asked her if she was the one who submitted the tip or knew who submitted it. She was asked to come up with solutions for HR to implement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NXDjo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Women who have worked despite the many blockades on the path to joining this company get called ‘Too Ambitious’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Avlbgl"&gt;Afterward, Kosak spoke with a supervisor who set her up with a meeting with Shotwell and the company’s head of HR, Brian Bjelde. During the meeting, Kosak says, Shotwell and Bjelde claimed to have never heard of her complaints and asked her to propose solutions for how to fix SpaceX’s harassment reporting process. She suggested conducting a third-party investigation, in an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6pwCE"&gt;After that meeting, Kosak had a follow-up call with HR, during which she was asked to detail her allegations again, and again asked for ideas on how to fix the harassment reporting process. She suggested that there be some kind of matrix of repercussions for harassing behavior, which the HR representatives seemed  reluctant to implement, suggesting that this information was too private to discuss openly in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ynoSK"&gt;It wasn’t the first time that Kosak had presented a plan to upper management. She had previously presented her own environmental plan to Elon Musk, detailing how to make SpaceX carbon neutral by 2030. Musk ultimately dismissed the idea, saying that SpaceX relies on some wind and solar energy, Kosak claims. Kosak also presented the Starlink team with an “environmental compliance initiative” that was deemed too ambitious by the people she presented it to, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NREmsX"&gt;“Men here are allowed to get promoted despite a clear disrespect for the requirements of their authority,” Kosak wrote in her original tip to Shotwell. “Women who have worked despite the many blockades on the path to joining this company get called ‘Too Ambitious’.” The day before Kosak’s essay was published, Musk tweeted that SpaceX plans to start an initiative to capture carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into rocket fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfvYQi"&gt;Due to the stress at work, Kosak took a leave of absence in November before quitting 10 days later. She received a phone call from HR during her leave and then two more after she left permanently. She did not answer the phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Fm6o"&gt;Kosak’s experiences with HR are mirrored by the experiences of another former employee of SpaceX, the female intern who dealt with a technician trying to enter her locked room. One night, a bunch of drunk technicians showed up at the house she was staying in at Vandenberg Village, near one of SpaceX’s launch sites, according to the former intern. The house was internship housing provided by SpaceX. One drunk technician, she says, repeatedly tried to enter her room, asking her if she was naked because she had just gotten out of the shower. She then came downstairs, where she says the technician tried to hug her and made obscene comments about women and her appearance. She then says she hid behind her couch, too scared to go back to her room because she thought he might follow her up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hTGbxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“if female employees are being negatively impacted, and if their work suffers, well, that’s too bad because this guy’s really good”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKeKWs"&gt;The day after the incident, the former intern says that an HR manager reached out to her about what had happened. The HR manager, she says, had heard about the incident from another individual who was present. She says after the meeting with HR, the technician confronted the intern at work and told her he was just teasing her. He also told her he was worried that he might lose his job. Fearing that she would not be hired on a permanent basis for speaking out, she did not fully cooperate with the HR investigation, as she had to continue working with the technician. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCDhDe"&gt;Later, after leaving the launch site where her internship was based, she did report all the details to HR. The HR manager would not tell her what actions had been taken, citing confidentiality and the fact that she was previously uncooperative with their initial investigation. However, the HR representative said the company did make one change to internship housing guidelines, and that employees of different genders would not share bathrooms anymore. She ultimately did not receive a job offer, and the technician continued to work at SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P6Isr"&gt;CrowleyFarenga, another former intern who filed a lawsuit against SpaceX which has since been resolved privately and dismissed, felt she was retaliated against even though she was reluctant to speak about her harassment. In her lawsuit, she alleged that her manager would comment that she was talking to too many men, even though she was one of very few women on the team, and that she should be careful about who she spoke to, lest people get the wrong impression about her. He would also apparently spend much more time with her during one-on-one meetings than her male colleagues. When she eventually reported his behavior, she was moved to another team but says she suddenly started receiving bad reviews. Ultimately, she learned that the person she reported the harassment to blocked her from getting hired after her internship ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzzrJb"&gt;“What they care more about is work than work culture,” CrowleyFarenga says of SpaceX. “And if female employees are being negatively impacted, and if their work suffers, well, that’s too bad because this guy’s really good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3ONeJ"&gt;The third former SpaceX intern who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; says they did receive a response from HR after a co-worker made an inappropriate comment to them over email about their Halloween costume. However, they saw plenty of people dealing with inappropriate behavior from co-workers that went unaddressed. The former employee recounted the experience of another woman at SpaceX who shared a cubicle with a man who would joke about putting porn on their shared TV and who made uncomfortable abortion jokes. Another female roommate of the employee wound up switching to a different team because of a team member’s unwanted advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD3bKO"&gt;All of the former employees who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; believe SpaceX’s failure to adequately address inappropriate behavior in the workplace stems from a larger problem with the company’s culture that devalues individual workers. All of them felt that culture comes from upper management, notably from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Kosak argues in the essay that Musk “uses engineers as a resource to be mined rather than a team to be led.” They all say burnout is high at the company, and that everyone is dedicated to the mission of exploring space. Any distractions from that mission are seen as something to eliminate, they argue, even if it’s an employee reporting harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R6T17"&gt;Ultimately, they see it as a big factor in why women leave the field of aerospace, and why the field continues to be dominated by men. The former employees hope that by sharing their stories, they’ll encourage other women to speak up. Along with the publication of Kosak’s essay, Lioness is also auctioning an NFT, the proceeds of which will go toward bringing more workplace harassment stories in the space industry and other fields to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LoAyRx"&gt;But most of all, the employees hope that women will feel safe in the field of aerospace someday. “I want women in aerospace to be able to be happy in the field and stay for decades and decades and contribute just like men do without being pushed out by issues that don’t get responded to,” says CrowleyFarenga. “I want them to be able to reach their full potential, which is what’s not happening because of misbehavior from men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGF4KK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq1j47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is requiring masks again at all US retail stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFTDMXcCnSWV9xPeXmYwluX9qjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270378/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOfkHh"&gt;Apple is again requiring customers to wear masks in all its US retail stores after it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;reportedly rolled back the mandate for around half of its locations&lt;/a&gt;. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the company said that “amid rising cases in many communities, we now require that all customers join our team members in wearing masks while visiting our stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqYlz"&gt;While employees have been required to wear masks throughout most of the pandemic, customers haven’t always had to, which has led to outbreaks at some Apple stores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that some locations will have occupancy limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5IAIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reportedly started dropping mask mandates for some stores in November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8jhBI"&gt;Apple’s current mask policy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763958/apple-mask-requirements-retail-store-customers-coronavirus"&gt;reportedly enacted in early November&lt;/a&gt; when some retail stores dropped the requirement following increased vaccination rates and decreased infection rates. This cycle seems to be a repeat of what happened this summer — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;started relaxing mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; for some stores in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;brought them back&lt;/a&gt; at most locations in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdyi7h"&gt;Apple is reinstating these requirements as the number of COVID infections in the US is again on the rise, even as booster shots start to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65K1T"&gt;This change also comes after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;widespread outbreak was reported at an Apple store&lt;/a&gt; in Southlake, Texas, earlier this month. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;According to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, 22 employees at the location tested positive for COVID following Black Friday, where some staff reported that customers (who were not required to wear masks) were packed into the store “shoulder to shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ljTxM"&gt;Apple also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures in stores to support the wellbeing of customers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s easier for hackers to jailbreak the PS4 than it is to buy a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ps4 stock playstation 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXwrRHNWeSfTLn9gUTfY0nAVcso=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270314/ps4.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEj60u"&gt;Hackers have jailbroken the PS4 with a new kernel exploit, &lt;a href="https://wololo.net/2021/12/13/ps4-9-00-jailbreak-poobs4-released/"&gt;according to Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt;, a website that covers jailbreaking news, seemingly opening the door for people to run things like homebrew apps on Sony’s last-gen consoles. The jailbreak is called “pOOBs4.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66tX5x"&gt;It’s a major development, but it comes with a big catch: the jailbreak only works on PS4 firmware 9.00 or lower, according to one of the people involved with the jailbreak, SpecterDev, which isn’t the newest PS4 software available. If you’ve already updated to the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps4/system-software/"&gt;latest firmware, 9.03&lt;/a&gt;, the jailbreak apparently won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q8g9s0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seeing a bit of confusion on 9.03 - this will *not* work on 9.03, it's patched. Only 9.00 and below.&lt;/p&gt;— Specter (@SpecterDev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470302473189535747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1lthK"&gt;Here’s a video from SpecterDev showing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470225946007556097"&gt;unofficial software running on the PS4&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EDwcP7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;9.  (awesome work by chendochap &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Znullptr&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://t.co/ME12bLyu3C"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ME12bLyu3C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Specter (@SpecterDev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470225946007556097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRQYn4"&gt;The kernel exploit &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; affects PS5, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr/status/1470263207122161668"&gt;according to Znullptr, another person involved with the jailbreak&lt;/a&gt;, but don’t get your hopes up about being able to mod your PS5’s software anytime soon, if ever. Znullptr says a PS5 version of the jailbreak “is not ready or being released” because the lead developer doesn’t have a PS5. (And it might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;hard to get one of the elusive consoles for a while&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3pxFZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright, was just a joke about caturday.&lt;br&gt;The exploit is legit, and as a bonus:&lt;br&gt;The kernel exploit affects Playstation5 as well!&lt;br&gt;(no, ps5 is not ready or being released, the lead developer does not currently have a ps5 console)&lt;/p&gt;— Z (@Znullptr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr/status/1470263207122161668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Oversight Board raises alarm over Facebook’s role in Ethiopian conflict</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmcGBf"&gt;The Oversight Board set up by Facebook &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/927673894608838-oversight-board-upholds-meta-s-original-decision-case-2021-014-fb-ua/"&gt;issued a decision today&lt;/a&gt; calling on the platform to begin an independent assessment of the platform’s role in heightening the risk of violence in Ethiopia, as part of a more specific ruling on a post that made unfounded claims about Tigrayan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaRE11"&gt;The ruling comes a year into an ongoing civil war between Ethiopian government and rebels in the northern Tigray region of the country, which has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59227672"&gt;created a humanitarian crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has left hundreds of thousands of people facing famine-like conditions and driven millions from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMpiPy"&gt;Facebook has come under fire for its role in the Ethiopian conflict, with observers drawing parallels with the company’s role in the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. There, an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt;online campaign led by Myanmar military personnel&lt;/a&gt; stoked hatred against the Rohingya minority groups and led to acts of mass murder and ethnic cleansing. In Ethiopia, similar rumors and incitements to violence &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbpd7/how-facebook-is-stoking-a-civil-war-in-ethiopia"&gt;have been allowed to proliferate&lt;/a&gt;, despite numerous Facebook employees reportedly raising the alarm within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGgZzN"&gt;Facebook’s lack of action was seemingly acknowledged by the Oversight Board. It recommended that Meta “commission an independent human rights due diligence assessment on how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread hate speech and unverified rumors that heighten the risk of violence in Ethiopia” and add specific guidance around rumors during war and conflict to its Community Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OONXxj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“​​In line with the board’s binding decision we have removed the case content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z0zB2"&gt;“​​In line with the board’s binding decision we have removed the case content,” said Facebook spokesperson Jeffrey Gelman in a statement. “We are reviewing the board’s full decision and recommendations, and per the bylaws, we will respond within 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUwIlb"&gt;The content at the heart of the decision was a post in Amharic that was uploaded to the platform in July 2021 and claimed without evidence that the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) had killed and raped women and children in the Ethiopian Amhara region with the assistance of Tigrayan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWlohG"&gt;After the post was flagged by automated language detection systems, an initial decision was made by a human moderator to remove it. The user who had posted the content appealed the decision, but a second content moderator confirmed that it violated Facebook’s Community Standards. The user then submitted an appeal to the Oversight Board, which agreed to review the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmJUzg"&gt;Ultimately, the Board found that the content violated Facebook’s Community Standard on Violence and Incitement, and it confirmed that the decision to remove it was correct. The Board also criticized Meta’s choice to restore the content in the time before a final decision was made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android Go reaches 200 million daily users just in time for Android 12 update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yn7gFv8lsWlsZtD3A1evFGpj1EQ=/222x0:3822x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270195/android12_go_edition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CprF08"&gt;Android Go, the lightweight version of the full-featured OS, has officially reached &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-12-go-edition/"&gt;over 200 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16736260/google-android-oreo-go-edition"&gt;first launched Android Go in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, offering a smoother Android experience for users on entry-level devices with 2GB of RAM or less.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIbIqvAnB0kFGvWJkWFp--KU69Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087202/android_12_go_speed.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apps on Android 12 (Go edition) open 30 percent faster.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GZ6AOl"&gt;Now, Google has also announced that some of these affordable devices will receive an update to Android 12 (Go edition), bringing a host of features from the standard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;newly released Android 12&lt;/a&gt; to more devices. Most notably, phones with Android 12 (Go edition) will open apps up to 30 percent faster and with smoother animation. Google says that apps will open without delay, eliminating the short period in which you might see a blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxE6Tn"&gt;Other features, like the privacy dashboard, are already available in the standard version of Android 12, letting you view and access your app permissions from one hub. You might also recognize the on-screen translation tool, automatic app hibernation that helps conserve your phone’s battery life, along with the handy feature that lets you share an app with nearby devices, preventing other users from having to use data to download it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmAYJl"&gt;Right now, it’s still unclear which devices will get the Android 12 (Go edition) update or when exactly the update will be rolled out. Google says it’s slated for 2022 but has yet to pinpoint a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap launches Story Studio, a standalone video editing app for mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBCr_L6oTWwBrKLxiXfi5Fd_pOA=/0x0:1967x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270100/snap_story_studio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Promo images of Snap’s Story Studio. | Images: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C27Ktl"&gt;Snap has launched a standalone video editing app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/story-studio/id1566585014"&gt;Story Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to give creators more precise editing control over vertical videos and allow them to add elements like text, trending audio, and AR lenses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445373/snap-ios-story-studio-app-video-edit-app-spotlight"&gt;First announced&lt;/a&gt; in May, the app is now available as an “early version” to iOS users in the US, UK, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19GTj2"&gt;Story Studio, which Snap says is being “built alongside creators,” is meant to be a more advanced video editing tool, like for creators using Spotlight. Launched a year ago, Spotlight is Snap’s response to TikTok — videos edited in Story Studio can be exported directly to Spotlight or a user’s Snapchat story. Videos can be downloaded and shared on other platforms, and they aren’t watermarked, unlike TikToks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Us4lu"&gt;Snap also announced that since the launch of Spotlight last November, the company has paid out more than $250 million to 12,000 creators. The company says it’s paying millions per month to users with top performing Spotlight submissions but did not specify an exact number. Snap says it will continue to offer a “range of opportunities” to reward popular creators but didn’t say whether the millions in payments per month would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WUfHw"&gt;Snap still faces stiff competition in the mobile video space from TikTok and Instagram Reels, and Facebook said in July it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;will pay out $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; through 2022. Though Snap says that Spotlight creators are posting three times as often as they were when the feature was announced, it’s still a relatively new product, and it’s up against behemoths like TikTok with 1 billion monthly users. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Army is in hot water over TikTok recruiting activity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kIlvE34OLHPBSfk_vdBFMwgYrg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270063/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CnG5Ad"&gt;The US Army is facing pressure from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) after &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/rubio-urges-army-to-enforce-ban-of-tiktok-for-recruitment"&gt;recruiters were caught using TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to find leads on young Americans to enlist, despite orders banning the app’s use on government devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUxn13"&gt;Issued on Monday to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, Rubio’s letter comes in response to &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/11/army-recruiters-tiktok-dance-around-ban-reach-gen-z/186935/"&gt;a recent report from &lt;em&gt;Nextgov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing how recruiters struggle to reach young adults online. The report detailed how many Army recruiters are ignoring the military’s TikTok ban, often using their own personal devices to create videos and reach out to young users to find enlistment leads. Some recruiters, like @njrecruiter, tout nearly 500,000 followers on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9EC54"&gt;In his letter, Rubio pressures Wormuth to take additional enforcement actions, citing possible threats posed by the app’s use due to its alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHGv2i"&gt;“Armed with biometric and other personal data, the CCP is able to track, monitor, and collect information on Americans anywhere in the world,” Rubio wrote. “From a military perspective, it can track troop movements, build source networks, or compile biographic profiles on military members for purposes of intelligence collection, exploitation, and manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Ldy1"&gt;Rubio also asks Wormuth to disclose how many Army recruiters use their personal devices for recruitment purposes and whether the Army has any protocols for ensuring soldiers do not download or use TikTok in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3dMu9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21044559/us-army-bans-soldiers-from-using-tiktok"&gt;The Army first banned the use of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019, but recruiters continue to use the app. Rubio also highlighted accounts like @njrecruiter, writing “I urge you to take decisive action to immediately end this practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ZWZE"&gt;The Army’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 is $50 off and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 hits a new low price</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQWZIa"&gt;It can be a little anxiety-inducing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;shop for holiday tech gifts&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of December. Black Friday and its deals feel like a long-forgotten tale of folklore, and there is only so much time remaining to make the purchase, get it, wrap it, and place it under the tree. But we’re always finding you the best deals each and every day, and today we have some great ones for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQAUIY"&gt;Starting off, the Apple Watch Series 7 has hit a new all-time low price this week. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F129685296%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578187165&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fq%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26redirectQuery%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have a selection of Series 7 smartwatches for $50 off, including the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;base 41mm and 45mm aluminum models with GPS&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-aluminum-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84736575%3Fpreselect%3D77640216%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;cellular-equipped counterparts&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640147%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;the stainless steel model&lt;/a&gt;. Each one is $50 off, and that brings the base model &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;41mm Series 7 down to a new low of about $350&lt;/a&gt;. The previous lowest price was only a $20 discount, so this is a prime opportunity to get Apple’s latest watch with a larger, edge-to-edge display until the deal ends on December 18th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thvhUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmLlQN"&gt;If you’re on a tighter budget, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F328828651%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578181648&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-se%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_2926746%3Fq%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26redirectQuery%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have various Apple Watch SE configurations for $50 off. The base &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D77640223%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;40mm aluminum version with GPS is now just $229.99&lt;/a&gt; — not its lowest price ever like its Series 7 counterpart, but the SE contains much of the innards from the previous flagship Series 6 at a much friendlier price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wpmPME"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUeq5"&gt;Now, for another all-time great deal that Android fans can actually enjoy, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097CNBDX2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 has hit a new low price of $1,349.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is this deal $150 better than its previous lowest cost, but it also comes with a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2. Be sure to check the extra savings or special offer lines on the Amazon listing, and click the dedicated button to add both to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0mkqI"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest flagship foldable, with a 6.2-inch outer screen and unfolding 7.6-inch inner display. While the Fold line first came to market with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;easily breakable and flawed design&lt;/a&gt;, it has now developed into something &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Dieter Bohn called “nearly normal” — which is high praise when you think about a smartphone with a screen you fold up and put in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7jnw8"&gt;Today’s deal brings the price down by a whole $450 for any of the color options in its 256GB storage configuration. If you want to be the most unique kid on your block by using a foldable phone, this price is as good as it gets for the phone-unfolds-into-small-tablet form factor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="925RjI"&gt;While those prior deals can be a bit polarizing if you only use iPhones or you only use Android, here is one that everyone can enjoy. Woot currently has some &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeries7121421/https://tools.woot.com/plus/meross-smart-home-products-7?ref=w_cnt_cdet_tool_dly_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exceptional deals on a couple of Meross smart home products&lt;/a&gt;, including a three-way smart dimmer switch kit for interior lighting and a garage door opener remote for easy access to your car hole, regardless of your location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqJ1IF"&gt;Meross is a solid choice for budget-friendly HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter isn’t here to save us from smart home complexity just yet&lt;/a&gt;, this garage door opener is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings. All you need is your smartphone to let yourself, or someone else while you’re away, into your garage. It’s normally priced at $49.99, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeriesSale121421/https://tools.woot.com/offers/meross-smart-garage-door-opener-remote-2?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has it for just $35&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="6sZ7yT"&gt;From the smart home to the TV streaming front, few set-tops have the loyal fan base of the Nvidia Shield TV line, thanks to its fast performance and flexible compatibility with apps like Plex. The newer Nvidia Shield TV Pro is the higher-end model over its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;tube-shaped sibling&lt;/a&gt;, running Android TV and compatible with all the major streaming apps. It looks a lot like the older model from 2015, but it packs a faster Tegra X1 Plus processor and supports Dolby Vision HDR. All of these improvements come at a bit of a cost, but you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YP9FBMM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro for $20 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to $179.99. If you don’t mind splurging for a TV streaming device that’s faster and more capable, saving money on the Shield TV Pro is a great option and solid alternative to the Apple TV 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

It was set to expire when the clock struck midnight, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcNuuACJ1V" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is still offering the excellent laptop for just $799.99&lt;/a&gt; — a discount of $200. I don’t mind that Best Buy made me a liar on this one, because it means you still get to buy the machine we named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the lowest price possible. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a whole lot of Facebook calling, so you have no excuse not giving mom or dad a call around the holidays. Unless, of course, there are &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Facebook-related reasons not to.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Nicolas Cage takes on his most challenging role yet: Nicolas Cage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vtzn9Egdvb1tCROeGnp4DJAcXXo=/176x0:859x455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269963/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_11.56.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3XLe"&gt;Do you ever watch a Nicolas Cage movie and think, “He just wasn’t Nick Cage enough for me”? Well, that shouldn’t be a problem in &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming movie in which Cage plays himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xHqht"&gt;It’s described as an “action-adventure,” and the premise is something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UQwFKB"&gt;Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2bq2m"&gt;The first teaser looks appropriately ridiculous, with Cage hamming it up in the best way, seemingly very much in on the joke. It kind of makes me want to watch &lt;em&gt;The Croods 2 &lt;/em&gt;— and maybe even revisit&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260020/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-sundance-nic-cage-sion-sono"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The movie is coming to theaters on April 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad adds magnets to its Base Station wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-NCiB5ih0nq1SmsE7K1Go1l4fw=/0x0:5899x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269880/856500018928_Lifestyle_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad Base Station Hub with magnetic alignment&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D1pWM"&gt;Nomad is updating its line of wireless chargers with the latest version of the Base Station Hub. A multi-device charger that can wirelessly charge up to two devices at the same time, plus charge two more devices through its USB ports, the new Base Station Hub now has embedded magnets to help align devices in the right spot on the pad. The new Hub costs $119.95 and is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for purchase starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMjCHA"&gt;Aside from the magnets, the new Hub is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s prior version&lt;/a&gt;. It has three charging coils under a leather pad that are each capable of up to 10W charging (iPhones will be limited to 7.5W). On the back of the charger is an 18W USB-C port and a 7.5W USB-A port for other devices. Nomad also sells an attachment that affixes to the back of the Hub and holds an Apple Watch charger (not included) that you plug into one of the USB ports on the back or a separate brick. It’s less elegant than the multi-device chargers that have Apple Watch chargers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BAkh"&gt;The biggest challenge with wireless charging pads is making sure your phone or device is put in the right place to actually charge. That’s where the magnets in the new Hub come in: they make it easy to tell when your compatible iPhone (12 or newer), AirPods, or even a Google Pixel 6 is in the right spot to charge efficiently. The magnets are not as strong as those in Apple’s MagSafe charger or most MagSafe accessories — they aren’t designed to hold your phone in place if an earthquake happens. But they do noticeably attach and align the phone in the right place when you put it down, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zytiU21ytftKWHObC2sfBOyWuQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085820/856500018928_G.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Base Station Hub’s leather pad are three charging coils surrounded by magnets, which help align compatible devices so they charge efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="11PnIJ"&gt;The Base Station Hub is not as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Nomad’s old Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which used a complex array of charging coils and was meant to let you just plop your phone down wherever and have it charge. But that device had significant limitations and compatibility issues with phones that used MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obtjdT"&gt;Ultimately, when it comes to wireless chargers, the most important thing is knowing that your device will charge when you place it down. The new Base Station Hub makes that just a little bit easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;
