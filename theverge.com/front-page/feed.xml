    <title>Nextdoor moderators scramble to address QAnon after Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-IT-COMMUNITIES-NEXTDOOR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEFsJq4BbMBnDlY8tUzeXSUEoRc=/0x0:5739x3826/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662741/1208432853.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BXmONW"&gt;For months, Nextdoor moderators have struggled with the challenge of addressing QAnon content on its neighborhood sites — but after last week’s deadly attack on the Capitol, the pressure between moderators and the company’s policy team may have reached a breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28LzEF"&gt;Moderators have been asking Nextdoor to impose a ban against QAnon content since at least October, according to forum screenshots obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Last week, Nextdoor moderators began pressuring the company directly in the National Leads Forum, a private forum for moderators on the site. In screenshots of forum posts, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, moderators expressed concern that Nextdoor’s misinformation policies did not fully bar discussions of conspiracy theories like QAnon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKM2ns"&gt;Following last week’s pro-Trump riot at the Capitol, one user returned to an early QAnon thread, writing, “I am bumping this up. It’s January 8th. Any policies yet? After the past week, we need some. I also wrote an email to Next Door Leadership about this three months ago and got no response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwNDf1"&gt;It wasn’t until five days after the riot that Nextdoor finally responded to the request, referring moderators back to the company’s policy on violent content. In this post, Caty K., Nextdoor head of community, wrote, “I want to reiterate that the broader Nextdoor team is committed to the safety of all members and communities on the platform.” She continued, “The violent events that took place at the US Capitol last week are no exception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9p8rQ"&gt;But some Nextdoor moderators say that the company’s misinformation policies don’t meaningfully address QAnon, and haven’t been communicated well enough to help communities deal with the conspiracy. The company’s misinformation policy asks moderators to report individuals who distribute “misinformation related to the Election and COVID-19,” but does not directly address conspiracy theories like QAnon. After the attack on the Capitol, many QAnon theories carry an implicit risk of inciting violence, but moderators find it hard to justify their removal as straightforwardly violent content. At the same time, current Nextdoor moderation policies do not include a ban on discussions of conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTe1g2"&gt;“The problem is this policy is written so specific to election and Covid-19 information and does not mention any violation that can be used for things like misinformation around politics and inciting fear in the community,” one moderator wrote in the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPCz8z"&gt;“Facebook has announced that it will be automatically removing content with the phrase ‘Stop The Steal’ and #StopTheSteal,” Steve C., a California lead responded. “Does Nextdoor plan to do the same?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OgPPp"&gt;On Monday, Caty wrote that “Nextdoor views QAnon as a hate group,” as a response to a thread titled “FB has banned all QAnon Content - what is ND policy?” Caty continued, “If you see content or members advocating these ideologies, please report them to our team and we will handle. I recognize we do not have a list of groups available for you all to reference, and I will work on that to make things clearer, but for now this comment serves the purpose of confirming that QAnon content should be removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOWfOY"&gt;On Wednesday, Nextdoor confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it classifies QAnon as a hate group. Still, there’s been no effort to communicate the QAnon policy to everyday users, and as of publication, Nextdoor has not updated its misinformation policies on its website to reflect its classification of QAnon as a hate group. “Right now we don’t have plans to email it out [to moderators,]” Caty said in response to a post asking if the decision would be communicated beyond the forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQxjOq"&gt;Nextdoor also referred &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;to its misinformation and violent content policies. “Any post or content on Nextdoor that organizes or calls for violence will be immediately taken down,” a Nextdoor spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Nextdoor’s Neighborhood Operations Team also uses a combination of technology and member reports to proactively identify and remove content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlz8Vu"&gt;Nextdoor has struggled to establish clear moderation policies in the past. Nextdoor neighborhoods are primarily self-governed, and unpaid “community leads” are in charge of reporting and removing content in their communities. This has led to content being wrongfully being removed or allowed to stay up. Last June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that posts supporting the Black Lives Matter movement were being wrongly taken down by Nextdoor moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Eos1V"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21526163/nextdoor-politics-misinformation-voting-election-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that QAnon-related content flourished on the platform in the last few weeks in the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential election. In one instance, &lt;em&gt;Recode &lt;/em&gt;said that a user bombarded Nextdoor for weeks on Twitter before the platform removed a post “containing QAnon talking points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTwsbO"&gt;According to Nextdoor’s rules, discussions of national politics are banned on the main community feed. As a result, public and private groups have grown to house these discussions. In forum posts obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, community moderators expressed worry over private groups that could be housing violent or extremist posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CjryCB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How can we ensure locked Groups are not participating in harmful discussions?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4BV9kN"&gt;“How can we ensure locked Groups are not participating in harmful discussions?” Jennifer V, an Arizona moderator, wrote in a forum post Tuesday. “We have a LOT of pro-Trump/Patriot Groups that I worry about. I also worry about other Leads or Community Reviewers seeing me report the Groups and the backlash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vETCzP"&gt;“My concern is QAnon content, as well as other content with conspiracy theories, promotions of violence, etc., that is in *private* groups that won’t get reported because the members of the group WANT that content,” Carol C., a Colorado moderator wrote in the forums last week. “I saw some of this type of content in the public political groups that have since gone private.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0LQEtKWhLDkKqCyM37jlAATz2M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651597/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event is less than a day away, kicking off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the upcoming event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differ in size. And since we first published this post, we’ve seen even more leaks about the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in a leaked preorder ad for the S21 Ultra. And of course, Samsung may surprise us with things that we don’t know about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJz7gG"&gt;We’ll be covering the whole thing here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But if you want to get an idea of what you can expect from the big day, here’s the rundown of what we think we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TqiJEm"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra will support the S Pen stylus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0G7_oTvi3-gJyp9V5o9U5zPg3k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231614/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U8SR"&gt;Let’s talk about the Ultra flagship first. The big new feature for the S21 Ultra is support for the S Pen stylus, as confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt;. However, the stylus will apparently be an optional accessory, and the phone isn’t rumored to have a dedicated slot to store it, unlike the company’s Note series of phones. The S Pen will cost just under €40, which translates to less than $49, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYkvk3"&gt;Samsung seemingly does plan to release cases that allow you to store the S Pen, though, and you can see pictures of two of those cases below, shared &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some cases may also come with the S Pen, according to a marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;shared by leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Kg5iB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10281935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1dLQd"&gt;As for cameras, the Ultra will apparently have four back cameras, including 3X &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10X telephoto cameras, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those telephoto cameras are also expected to have optical image stabilization and a 10-megapixel resolution. The phone may also have Samsung’s 100X “Space Zoom” feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132870/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-zoom-100x-space-optical-hybrid-digital-periscope"&gt;first debuted in the Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcHFUh"&gt;The other two back cameras are rumored to be a 108-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the selfie camera may be 40 megapixels. The phone could also have laser-assisted autofocus, something that was included with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79T64A"&gt;You can get a closer look at the rumored camera setup and features for the Ultra in this leaked marketing image &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350645300670467"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uATsHSI3-sYDtd66u_a-jwZYFu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232849/ErnanHfXYAA9gz2__1_.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDMfVq"&gt;The Ultra is also expected to have a 6.8-inch WQHD+ (3200 x 1440) resolution display, according to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s expected to support a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1346342403792273413"&gt;leaker Ice Universe&lt;/a&gt; says the S21 Ultra may be able to run at that full WQHD+ resolution with the 120Hz refresh rate, something that the S20 Ultra couldn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWM6E3"&gt;The S21 Ultra is rumored to support 5G networks, be IP68 certified for water and dust resistance, have a 5,000mAh battery, and come with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. It also could come in a wide range of colors — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;including brown&lt;/a&gt; — though some of the colors may only be available on Samsung’s online store, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120570.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1E36WI"&gt;Blass shared what appears to be the full &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350658118459392"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra (and the S21 and S21 Plus) across two tweets. These tweets also include information about what Samsung is including in the box — which we’ll touch on a bit later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a7lbvG"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will offer similar specs at different sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it5FRQ3b2AXEL7gtf2AG_SR1K-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231623/ErjQbLVXIAIUOju.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14BTZ"&gt;Samsung also plans to announce the Samsung S21 and S21 Plus, which won’t have quite as powerful specs as the Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SIeKj"&gt;The most obvious difference between the S21 and S21 Plus is a smaller camera module. The two phones are expected to have a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And both phones will reportedly have a 10-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jhke"&gt;Here’s a better look at the cameras on the S21, thanks to another leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yhor9DKX7P2whgS81d6AC-kqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226116/e621085f8ae9e2b7f52b30e774a0648f163650b16b9f84df9afe07c77759bbd3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21’s and S21 Plus’ rumored camera setups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddghEu"&gt;As for screens, the standard S21 is expected to have a 6.2-inch display with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution, while the S21 Plus is rumored to have a 6.7-inch screen with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. Both are expected to support an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349399984916082690"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349399998673399809"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; shared by Blass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="117x1F"&gt;Like the Ultra, both the S21 and S21 Plus are expected to support 5G networks and be IP68-certified. They’re also expected to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And depending on which model you buy, they’ll have different battery sizes: the smaller S21 is rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery, while the S21 Plus is expected to have a 4,800mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py3yCA"&gt;Each phone is also rumored to have a different back cover material. The S21 could have a plastic back, while the S21 Plus may have a glass back, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqsBCJ"&gt;You can see the full spec sheets for these two phones and the Ultra across &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350653848662021"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349350658118459392"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from Blass. And like the S21 Ultra, the S21 Plus may come in colors that are only available online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120570.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OG7VjD"&gt;The S21 lineup may not include a power charger in the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q72Bf7"&gt;Samsung’s newest phones will take a cue from Apple by not including a charger in the box, according to leaked marketing renders of the box shared &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120535.html"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226"&gt;Blass&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the box, it seems you’ll only get the phone, a USB-C cable, and a SIM ejector tool. And Samsung recently deleted ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;mocking Apple&lt;/a&gt; for not including a charger with the iPhone 12 lineup, lending credence to rumors that Samsung will be making a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KSbPQp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What's (not) in the box. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS21Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS21Ultra&lt;/a&gt; aka no charger makes the packaging much smaller.&lt;a href="https://t.co/B4tL980QqG"&gt;https://t.co/B4tL980QqG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1348936174690308097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meFNfx"&gt;While the decision could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;a good one for the environment&lt;/a&gt;, keep in mind that if you’re thinking about picking up an S21, you may also need to consider purchasing a separate charging brick to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCf341"&gt;The new phones may run Samsung’s One UI 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj3VlO"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup may run One UI 3.1, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD3a6gHZeQ"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Jimmy is Promo reveals some of the features that could be coming in the new update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TBEzw3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aD3a6gHZeQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRol9y"&gt;The video, which apparently demonstrates One UI 3.1 running on the S21 Ultra, shows off a way to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, some of the S Pen features that work on the S21 Ultra, backgrounds for the call screen, the ability to select video resolution from the video recording screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvS9V2"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds could compete with the AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s rumored Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Det9wn"&gt;In addition to its S21 slate of phones, Samsung is also heavily rumored to announce a new set of true wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro. Not only have they been revealed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;preorder freebie&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra in a leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;shared by Blass&lt;/a&gt;, but YouTuber Digital Slang has already posted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Buds Pro and their comparisons with the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GDIfgKm0Zeg"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9cJJVFJkFgU"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NtfL99"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGUMP0xsio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3prOX"&gt;The new earbuds are rumored to have active noise cancellation, an eight-hour battery life (up to 28 hours with the charging case), and an IPX7 water / sweat rating. You can see how the Galaxy Buds Pro compare to some of Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds in this leaked spec sheet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro may cost $199, making them a more affordable alternative to the $249 Apple AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hLHE2"&gt;Samsung may launch its Tile-like item tracker called the Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJQ7mSqcubi_fODBqbacWlaryb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208211/smarttagleak.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9flwoY"&gt;Samsung’s rumored new Tile-like Galaxy SmartTag will apparently use Bluetooth to connect with devices and share its location. The tag itself looks to be a small square with rounded corners and a loop at the top to make it easier to attach to things, as shown in photos posted on the website of Taiwan’s telecom regulator &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;and shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design in the photos also matches an image of the SmartTag in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;leaked ad&lt;/a&gt; of preorder bonuses for the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izd5pO"&gt;It seems likely that the SmartTags will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s new SmartThings Find app&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you track the locations of your Galaxy devices, similar to Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KbTTwE"&gt;Samsung could also announce new wireless charging pads and a rose gold smartwatch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Oia0eJ"&gt;Samsung may announce a few other things at Thursday’s event. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt tweeted about two &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349166544740376577"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349166197305171970"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;, including one that seems to have dedicated spots for a phone and a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new Chromebook CX9 offers military-grade durability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two models of the Asus Chromebook CX9 sit perpendicular to each other. The one facing the camera displays a birds-eye view of a shoreline." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1UoqbsH4ZiLzcvicFMUXyGx_ks=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662365/Chromebook_CX9_CX9400_premium_enterprise_resady_Security_titan_C.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;2.2 pounds ain’t bad. | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6kAR4"&gt;Asus’ new Chromebook CX9 is a powerhouse of a Chromebook built for professionals. Pricing is still to be announced, but it’s coming to North America in Q2 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrmocy"&gt;Per Asus, the Chromebook CX9 is powered by up to an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor. That’s an unusual processor to see in a Chromebook — students and more casual Chromebook customers don’t usually need more than a Core i3 — but it’s the best option for power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrW9Xh"&gt;It also packs that power into quite a portable chassis, which is just 0.63 inches thick (16 mm) and 2.2 pounds. And Asus says it meets the MIL-STD-810H US military standards for durability, so you should have no problem battering it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ocx2vjHl7Zf0dCXo_2FoOJbEjHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233216/Chromebook_CX9_CX9400_Toughness_lightness_thinness.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s44__N3_teBjdWI_Ixn4A-WvxmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233225/Chromebook_CX9_CX9400_Toughness_lightness_810H_MIL_grade.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKbwi"&gt;In addition, the new Chromebook supports Wi-Fi 6 and includes Harman Kardon-certified dual speakers. Asus says it’s “loaded with I/O” ports, including the new Thunderbolt 4 standard as well as HDMI outputs. And it offers &lt;a href="https://showcase.withgoogle.com/titan-c/"&gt;Titan C security&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s security chip designed specifically for Chromebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fScad7"&gt;Asus also introduced the Chromebook Flip CX5 and C536, two consumer-oriented Chromebooks that will also feature 11th Gen Intel processors. Those models are coming in Q1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvXrt0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is adding a ‘Guest Mode’ to its smart speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ezCUzsBK0KNvPsXMVDvNfF8VvuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662307/dseifert_190905_3634_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9FLfqY"&gt;Beginning today, Google smart speakers like the Nest Hub and Nest Mini will have a new option called “Guest Mode.” When enabled by saying “Hey Google, turn on guest mode,” the speaker will act a bit more like a public Google Assistant terminal and a bit less like your own personal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbYvCT"&gt;When Guest Mode is turned on, queries are no longer saved to your Google account and some personal data like your calendar won’t be shown. However, the speaker will still be able to do the basics like set timers, answer questions, and play music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mm0jBv"&gt;However, don’t think this works as a way to secure your personal data: turning off Guest Mode is as simple as asking for the speaker to do it. The idea is apparently that if you’re having guests over to your house (which, right now: please don’t), they won’t accidentally see your calendar and whatnot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCayEv"&gt;The feature is not quite as robust as Incognito mode on your Chrome browser. Although interactions aren’t saved, the speakers still need to be connected to your account so they can continue to access all the integrations you’ve set up with music, smart lights, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg5AvB"&gt;In other words, this is not a good solution for Airbnb hosts. Google does have a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/hands-free-hotel-stays-google/"&gt;hospitality mode for its speakers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s primarily meant for hotels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juPEdH"&gt;When you exit Guest Mode, your queries will again be saved to your Google account. But as the company announced this past August, it is no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354805/google-email-audio-privacy-opt-in-human-reviewers-assistant"&gt;longer saving audio recordings by default&lt;/a&gt; unless you actively choose to allow it to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>But wait, Asus has even more gaming monitors equipped with HDMI 2.1 ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Strix XG43UQ" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO5zQv-kIUcYCcp2f2aYK8MPm0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662308/asusxg43uq.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Asus’ big XG43UQ.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6jqT61"&gt;We covered Asus’ announcement of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226726/asus-rog-swift-pg32uq-gaming-monitor-4k-144hz-ips-120fps-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-features"&gt;32-inch ROG Swift PG32UQ&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week as part of CES 2021, but the company waited until now to reveal more monitors that have HDMI 2.1 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkbGkQ"&gt;Basically, these are the screens you want if you have a high-end PC, a PS5, or an Xbox Series X so you can see your gameplay in 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. They’re a big deal if you really want to let your hardware rip, which is why we’ve been closely covering monitors and TVs with the requisite HDMI 2.1 ports required to achieve that high-end resolution and performance balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyaVUg"&gt;Starting with what will likely be the most expensive option (though Asus hasn’t shared a price), the 43-inch ROG Strix XG43UQ is shown above. This model has a 4K VA-type display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. With its Display Stream Compression (DSC) feature, it &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be able to display that full 4K 144Hz via its DisplayPort, like the ROG Swift PG32UQ can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IanoI"&gt;This model sports two HDMI 2.1 ports with support for FreeSync Premium Pro, variable refresh rate (VRR), and auto-low-latency mode (ALLM). There are also two HDMI 2.0 ports. This panel has HDR1000, and it covers 90 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Gaming VG28UQL1A" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSuxWiQrtCs0xIyBYhuuYvYsXQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233001/asustufces2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus TUF Gaming VG28UQL1A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vX5xel"&gt;Onto the TUF Gaming VG28UQL1A, it’s a 28-inch 4K IPS display that also tops out at 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. It has HDR400, which is going to be far less bright than the model above, and it covers 90 percent of the DCI-P3 color space. Asus says this one has VRR support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na5lEf"&gt;I’d show you a picture of the screen itself, but Asus thought it was appropriate to only send us pictures of its rear. We’ll just trust that it does, indeed, have a screen. This model has two HDMI 2.1 ports and two HDMI 2.0 ports, alongside a DisplayPort 1.4 that should be able to push 4K at 144Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96JQIF"&gt;Asus says that these monitors will release in Q2 2021, which is the general time range we’ve been provided for most of these exciting HDMI 2.1-compliant gaming monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG279QM" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BO893PII7IlDMxRgF6h8nLo5LA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233006/asuspg279qm.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Swift PG279QM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OaZX6H"&gt;If you aren’t interested in jumping aboard the HDMI 2.1 train, Asus has one more monitor for those interested in high frame rates at stable resolutions. It’s the ROG Swift PG279QM, a 27-inch 1440p IPS panel with a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and HDMI 2.0 ports. It’ll support HDR400 with 95 percent of the DCI-P3 color space covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLw3MB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-monitors/rog-swift-pg279qm-gaming-monitor-intro/"&gt;Asus says this monitor&lt;/a&gt; features Nvidia’s G-Sync processor and Reflex Latency Analyzer tech to determine the latency of your accessories. It will release in Q2 2021, and no price has been shared at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ 2021 laptop line includes two new dual-screen ZenBooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Zenbook Pro Duo 15 OLED in a low-lit office space. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tbQNX0fxCvGkmzFp14_nlRHYw8=/0x11:9451x6312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662341/ZenBook_Pro_Duo_15_OLED_UX582_Scenario_photo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Zenbook Pro Duo 15 OLED is coming in April. | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zOo1Z"&gt;Asus has announced two new dual-screen ZenBook Duo laptops as part of its slate of CES 2021 announcements. The 15-inch model will be available in North America in April of this year, but you can &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM120000007"&gt;preorder the 14-incher&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99 starting January 14th to ship on January 22nd. There’s also a new VivoBook and a new ExpertBook for folks looking for light and portable purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC2148"&gt;If you’re new to the ZenBook Duo line, the laptops have a primary screen (the regular one) as well as a secondary screen (the ScreenPad Plus) that’s built into the top half of the keyboard deck. It’s not really big enough to do anything on, but you can load your distractions (Twitter, Discord, etc.) onto it to keep them out of your main workspace. Some programs, including Adobe’s, also offer ScreenPad-specific interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jxZWf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Asus’ ZenBook Duo line is getting better Intel processors and Nvidia graphics chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1rz6N"&gt;The 15.6-inch ZenBook Pro Duo 15 OLED is an update to the dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20908627/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook Pro Duo 15&lt;/a&gt;, a 15.6-inch dual-screen laptop with a primary OLED display. There’s also a 14-inch model, a sequel to the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;ZenBook Duo&lt;/a&gt; that came out last year. This model is verified through Intel’s Evo program, which means Intel vouches that it has good performance, battery life, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHxgXl"&gt;The two Duos got a spec bump: The Pro Duo 15 OLED now has Intel’s 10th Gen processors (up to a Core i9) and Nvidia’s latest GeForce RTX 3070 mobile GPU. The ZenBook Duo 14 now includes Intel’s 11th Gen processors (a Core i7 or a Core i5) with Iris Xe integrated graphics (and you can add an Nvidia GeForce MX450 GPU as well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twYWOQ"&gt;The update I’m happiest about is that they both have a new design that tilts the ScreenPad Plus upward — it’s no longer flat on the keyboard deck. That means you don’t need to crane your neck over the keyboard to read the secondary display, something that was inconvenient about the older Duo models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKigZy"&gt;There’s also a new hinge design that Asus says is 30 percent smaller, and a smaller fan size. Asus has also upgraded the ScreenPad’s software (it’s now called Screen Xpert 2) to include  new apps that make multitasking easier. With a new Window Flick feature, for example, you can easily “flick” windows from one display to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user edits a photo using a stylus on the Asus Zenbook Duo 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80bahzQVurBt8_83f6kI8AJu9NY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232888/ASUS_II_0224__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the 14-inch model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OhyDVB"&gt;Outside of ZenBook land, there’s a new VivoBook S14, which is also Evo-certified. Asus says it’s the lightest 14-inch VivoBook ever made at just 2.87 pounds. The S14 has also been bumped up to 11th Gen processors with Xe graphics. Asus says you’ll get up to 17 hours of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r0F2H"&gt;There’s a regular VivoBook 14 as well, which is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 5000 U-Series mobile processors&lt;/a&gt;. Both models are coming to North America in February, with pricing to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The VivoBook S14, open, faces away from the camera next to a pile of accessories including a tennis racket, a toolbox, and a pair of sunglasses." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mon4bK_4eMm9PeWeyAA9jctKflQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232868/VivoBook_S14_S435_Unique_and_modern_Deep_Green_metallic_chassis.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the VivoBook S14 in “deep green.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8LPVve"&gt;Finally, Asus has made some updates to its ExpertBook lineup, including its astonishingly light ExpertBook B9. The new model’s full name is the ExpertBook B9 B9450CEA (vPro). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho2BBT"&gt;The 1.94-pound laptop, which Asus says is the world’s lightest 14-inch business laptop, now includes Intel’s latest 11th Gen vPro processors, which provide a number of security and remote management features, including Intel’s Active Management Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW0TWl"&gt;The ExpertBook has a number of new features designed to make conference calls easier, including two-way AI noise-canceling technology, Harman Kardon-certified speakers, and support for Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH5pYN"&gt;The new ExpertBook B9 is coming in Q1 2021, with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9 seen from above, with backlit keyboard illuminated. The touchpad displays an LED numpad.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new ExpertBook B9 has “military-grade durability” according to Asus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>LG’s new batch of gaming monitors includes 4K / 144Hz panel with HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5ekhTEYZFRXf6Bm1wB2xad2jtw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662113/New_LG_Ultra_Monitor_UltraGear__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nfYlR8"&gt;LG has unveiled &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/01/enhanced-and-upgraded-for-2021-lgs-newest-ultra-series-monitors-exceed-all-expectations/"&gt;three new gaming monitors&lt;/a&gt; as part of its CES 2021 announcements, following its introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224922/lg-ultrafine-oled-pro-4k-monitor-ces-2021"&gt;new flagship entry in its UltraFine series&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. The new batch of displays includes a model refresh on LG’s 27GN950 gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1 support, a 32-inch 1440p display, and a 34-inch 1440p ultrawide monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkxFxS"&gt;The LG UltraGear 27GP950 is a 27-inch 4K gaming monitor, which uses a Nano IPS panel and supports a rapid refresh rate of 144Hz, though LG says it does offer 160Hz through overclocking. It also supports an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt; and variable refresh rate, allowing gamers to experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226726/asus-rog-swift-pg32uq-gaming-monitor-4k-144hz-ips-120fps-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-features"&gt;4K gaming on both PC and consoles&lt;/a&gt; at a 120Hz refresh rate, which could be appealing to new owners of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S / X who want to opt for a monitor over a TV for next-gen gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MNQRZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG has yet to reveal a release date or pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B14UIk"&gt;A successor to LG’s 27GL850 monitor release last year, the UltraGear 32GP850 is a 31.5-inch monitor that features a 165Hz refresh rate (180Hz when overclocking) and delivers a 1440p resolution gaming experience. Lastly, the new LG UltraGear 34GP950G is a 34-inch ultrawide 1440p monitor with a 21:9 aspect ratio and features Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate certification, which LG says will allow the monitor to provide “the best picture quality with minimized visual stuttering and tearing.” (The other two in the batch are G-Sync compatible.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thM3RV"&gt;LG has yet to reveal a release date or pricing for the UltraGear 27GP950, 32GP850, or 34GP950G monitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s latest 4K laser projector supports AirPlay 2 for $2,999</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAa1i7a1_RcN7zPqbWwSokKMrVs=/143x0:1454x874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662042/pjt_hu810pw_2020_11_wireless_connection_d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HU810P includes support for AirPlay 2 and other streaming standards.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Zd1Wb"&gt;LG’s HU810P is a new $2,999 4K laser projector which supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard and runs webOS 5.0. It’ll be available worldwide on January 18th. The projector was originally announced in August, &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/lg-cinebeam-hu810p-projector-with-dual-laser-2700-lumens-lens-shift-announced.3166777/page-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AVSForum&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLz5Vm"&gt;According to LG, the HU810P is able to generate a screen as big as 300 inches corner to corner, and it offers 2,700 ANSI lumens of brightness. It supports the HDR10 and HLG HDR standards, and it’s able to adjust its picture depending on the content you’re watching or the room in which you’re watching it. For example, it has Bright Room and Dark Room modes that can detect the amount of ambient light in a room and adjust its picture accordingly, and it’s also able to adjust its frame rate to 24Hz for films. Its laser light source is rated for 20,000 hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projector includes three HDMI ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utwt0E"&gt;WebOS 5.0 means the projector supports a number of streaming services natively, including Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Hulu, and there’s also Miracast support for streaming from compatible devices. Otherwise, there are three HDMI ports in total, of which one is HDMI 2.1, according to &lt;em&gt;AVSForum&lt;/em&gt;. The projector supports eARC for higher-quality audio, it can stream audio using Bluetooth, and it’s got Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMDqh0"&gt;LG released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/4/16851806/lg-hu80ka-4k-uhd-hdr-projector-announced-features"&gt;first 4K projector&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and it’s also released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/21/18151733/lg-4k-laser-projector-hu85l-ultra-short-throw-ces-2019"&gt;short throw model&lt;/a&gt; that works even if you place it just inches from a projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bandsintown launches monthly subscription service, giving fans 25 exclusive concerts a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Visible Presents “Red Rocks Unpaused” 3-Day Music Festival at Red Rocks Amphitheatre - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfT8DGD2WZzWt4ijn5o_XOBtZuI=/45x0:3492x2298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662034/1270300100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rich Fury/Getty Images for Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SjFfKg"&gt;Attending an actual concert still isn’t a good idea in the United States, so Bandsintown is launching a monthly subscription service that will stream a number of exclusive shows directly into customers’ homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soa9uc"&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.bandsintown.com/plus/"&gt;Bandsintown Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the $10 monthly service pays for 25 shows a month, according to the company. Artists signed on to play shows include Phoebe Bridgers, Tycho, Flying Lotus, Soccer Mommy, Chromeo, and Little Dragon to name a few. Customers will also receive additional perks, including “intimate chats with artists” and access to performances on other platforms, according to the company. The first show kicks off this month, with artists scheduled through January and February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdWxsP"&gt;Musicians will receive a flat fee for each performance, Fabrice Sergent, managing partner of Bandsintown, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the artists are provided with studio access in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville, and a select group of artists will be provided with a host for live Q&amp;amp;A sessions for fans to participate in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wksr1R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reality is that we saw that fans were watching live streams from places that we had never seen people watching live music before”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GRASqJ"&gt;While the shows are exclusive to Bandsintown, artists aren’t. Sergent understands that while Bandsintown is experiencing a growth in users (before the pandemic, less than 30 percent of people watched live streams, but that number grew to just under 75 percent by October 2020), there are other platforms with much bigger audiences. He sees Bandsintown as complementary to other streams and to live performances once those return. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574128/bandcamp-live-stream-virtual-concert-tickets-merch-covid-19"&gt;pandemic helped prove&lt;/a&gt; there was a customer base willing to watch live music online, and that helped spur the monthly subscription offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXCs4E"&gt;“The reality is that we saw that fans were watching live streams from places that we had never seen people watching live music before,” Sergent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUdgRf"&gt;Currently, Bandsintown has 60 million registered users. Sergent declined to say how many people use the service monthly or how long they stay on the site. More information about those metrics will come at a later date, Sergent added. Right now, his focus is on building up the subscription service, which is exclusive to the US right now, but the company is hoping to expand it into international territories soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfikrr"&gt;Building up the subscription offering also includes finding incentives to get people to sign up, including figuring out better ways to sell exclusive artist merchandise. The goal is to have merchandise natively integrated into the service. Bandsintown’s teams want to find ways to support artists, Sergent said, but the company is also trying to jump on a booming trend and transform it into a revenue stream that exists long after the pandemic ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNqVMj"&gt;“We’re opening gates to something new that will stay beyond the pandemic, and will be complimentary to an in-person show.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today’s day ends in y, so it’s time for more Samsung Galaxy leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEfD5lZuHIVEFeNd8DCzsbhtF5M=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662005/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1610374922_0_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked images show a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra with space for its optional stylus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7E9ca9"&gt;Samsung is announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Galaxy S21 smartphones tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to dozens of leaks, most of the details are already public. Today saw yet more images of the upcoming handsets leak online, offering more details on their specs, key features, and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wDd0I"&gt;First up is this &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It contains images of a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which includes space for its optional stylus. This case appears to differ from one shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212835/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-case-40-euros-accessory"&gt;previous leak&lt;/a&gt; that included a flip cover designed to protect the front of the phone. Cases like these are believed to be an important accessory for the new Galaxy device since it reportedly won’t include a built-in carrying slot for the optional stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAoH2i"&gt;Evan Blass has also shared a host of images of the unannounced phone. Images include one of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226/photo/2"&gt;S21’s packaging&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be smaller in size and won’t contain a charging brick as standard, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120535.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another image suggests Samsung is planning to offer wireless earbuds like the Galaxy Buds Live or Galaxy Pro, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;SmartTag Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt;, as preorder bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2jDiru"&gt;Blass has also shared a collection of screenshots that show how the specs of the three Galaxy S21 phones — the S21, S21 Ultra, S21 Plus — compare to one another. You can see the tweets below for the details. Here’s our summary of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;what to expect&lt;/a&gt; from the upcoming phones and other devices at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
