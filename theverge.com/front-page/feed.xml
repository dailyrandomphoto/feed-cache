    <title>Sony’s photo-focused Xperia 1 III is down to its best price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_CxeZ8k2x_ygSDoZL6IeEn4TEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330017/ajohnson_210712_4667_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjDaKo"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 1 III has a few things that other flagship phones don’t, including a near-4K, 120Hz OLED display, along with plenty of high-quality manual photo and video controls, dual front-facing speakers, and a headphone jack. And yet, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; it — mostly due to its high $1,300 cost. Though, today’s deal on the phone makes the price just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;more digestible. For only the second time since it launched during the summer, Sony’s unlocked Xperia 1 III smartphone has returned to its all-time low price of $1,198 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xperia-III-Smartphone-6-5-21/dp/B091YC2SJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsox1m3.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeSonyExperia1III123021"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5b51"&gt;For context, that’s around the same price as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; and even cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent storage capacity. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjekA7kR3O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has the smartphone on sale for $1,199.99, yet the retailer is also throwing in a free Microsoft 365 trial and a 50 percent discount on an Ultra Mobile SIM kit, if those things matter to you. For those impressed enough by the promise of the phone’s screen and its excellent photo and video-shooting capabilities, this could be a great chance to snag the device before the price goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0X7Mpr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10952660"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8EWbh0"&gt;Lenovo’s excellent Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop is selling at a great price over at Antonline. While it costs around &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-7-16GB-RAM-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-512GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Gray-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals123021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,850 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (it’s rarely in stock for its $1,530 MSRP, unfortunately), &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Lenovo/Computers/Computer_Systems/Notebooks/1436996" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $1,489.99 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, and the value is tough to beat for this price. This model has a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display at QHD Plus resolution, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip (with a total graphics power of 130W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Basically, it’s a stacked machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; this laptop in 2021, praising its performance and specs for the price. He even went as far as to refer to it as “Lenovo’s best gaming laptop yet.” The Legion 5 Pro also impressed with its typing experience and the amount of ports available. It’s tough to find a laptop that’s this powerful for under $1,800. For context, it’s about as capable as Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eMvXUc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10843973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XEemS"&gt;Looking to warm up your home while saving a bit of money on heating costs? Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQT85FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the Ecobee SmartThermostat for $199&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), matching its Black Friday price. The smart thermostat features a touchscreen display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; was more responsive and easier to navigate than the one on its predecessor. It also supports voice controls and flexible scheduling, and it includes an external temperature sensor that will help maintain comfort in remote rooms. This smart thermostat offers support for HomeKit and Siri and is also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, and SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6TBezw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCqQ3a"&gt;One of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best SSDs compatible with the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; recently dropped to its lowest price to date. Normally $229.99, B&amp;amp;H Photo is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1593680-REG%2Fsamsung_mz_v8p1t0b_am_1tb_980_pro_pcie.html%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F30%2F22858521%2Fsony-xperia-1-iii-smartphone-apple-airpods-max-ecobee-smart-thermostat-samsung-980-pro-ssd-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s lightning-quick 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD for $149.99&lt;/a&gt; (discount applies at checkout). That’s $80 off one of the few drives out there that meets Sony’s performance requirements for its latest console, assuming you have a heatsink like &lt;a href="https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-m-2-nvme-heatsink-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EKWB’s EK-M2 NVMe&lt;/a&gt; to pair with it. This M.2 SSD also works with PC, but you need to have a compatible motherboard to enjoy its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds. Otherwise, it’ll still work but at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8LQq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXP5LD"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to headphones, you still have four days left to snag a set of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 for their lowest price to date. Regularly $149.99, Woot is selling the true wireless earbuds — which come with support for active noise cancellation — for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealRoundup122921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt; through January 3rd. Note, however, that these don’t come with Samsung’s one-year warranty but rather a 90-day warranty through Woot. Think twice about this. We’ve seen the price at other retailers dipping down to around $110, but Woot’s deal might be the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMhK4"&gt;After reviewing them, my colleague Chris Welch was impressed by their audio quality as well as their small, discreet design. In fact, these wireless earbuds are easily some of Samsung’s smallest and lightest yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96Zafn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jBFpoG"&gt;Some other good deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PlZUg3"&gt;If you need a new power adapter, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy Apple’s official 20W USB-C adapter for $15.69&lt;/a&gt; instead of $19 at Amazon, its lowest price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zUwfxE"&gt;A few of Oculus’ must-have accessories for the Quest 2 headset are still discounted, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap at $39&lt;/a&gt; (usually $49) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard zip-up case for $39&lt;/a&gt; (also normally $49).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IISEE3"&gt;You can reserve a pair of the AirPods Max at Micro Center &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/632264/apple-airpods-max-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-space-gray" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re currently only available for in-store pickup in select regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6rWSSG"&gt;Amazon is discounting the Eve Energy Strip, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Energy-Strip-overvoltage-overcurrent/dp/B07PX57RH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling it for an all-time low of $79.96&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. The Eve Energy Strip makes it easy to independently control three power outlets via Siri, an app, or using a handful of other devices while at home or away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peXUTj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjfrEqT5DB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling Razer’s Basilisk v2 wired gaming mouse for $34.99 instead of $79.99. The latter is also offering a $10 discount on Microsoft’s PC Game Pass with your purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>11 great apps for your new Windows 11 PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cErXSq4L7kigPYjOTX9tlueXHh4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70329991/RoundUpArt_Windows_Apps.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some great ways to tweak your new PC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SwVdsW"&gt;This year marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;the launch of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Stock permitting, there are a variety of PCs and laptops available with Microsoft’s new operating system, and while the updated Microsoft Store fills out with apps, we figured we’d put together a list of our 11 favorite apps for a new Windows 11 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRkdgf"&gt;We’re covering productivity, gaming, and media playback, so there should be an app for everyone here. There are even some options to bring back Windows 10 functionality if you’re missing some of the features and customizations Windows used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i0xzk2"&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EarTrumpet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxAAgsaHQAb7t7zSpMRRxMU6Q4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098073/I036YhD.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: File-New-Project&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JW7TDE"&gt;Microsoft’s built-in Windows 11 audio management still isn’t great. EarTrumpet overhauls it completely, with a system tray utility that gives you volume levels for every app and the ability to set custom inputs and outputs for those apps. If you want YouTube to play out of your speakers but prefer that your game audio output on your headset, then this is the app for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GXY64D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925408" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1HcEbi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9WU5dB"&gt;Tweeten&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweeten" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZEk2QIqIieInt5tRWp3p3Au5gE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7696055/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mehedi Hassan‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweeten&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cURsfv"&gt;Twitter’s app for Windows is just a web app, and TweetDeck doesn’t even have its own dedicated app. If you’re a fan of TweetDeck, Tweeten gives you TweetDeck on Windows by taking the web interface of TweetDeck and making it a lot more Windows 11-friendly. There are a bunch of customization options and even a notification interface if you want to be alerted to Twitter activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U26kS4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925424" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X9yh1E"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fy6zt4"&gt;FeedLab&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FeedLab" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNuIEr6wguc_9hIwk-Ax2Pg9g8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098076/Jg3Yslv.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ClevLab‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FeedLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCryd"&gt;There are lots of RSS apps available on Windows, but FeedLab is my top pick. I’ve been using this RSS reader ever since Nextgen Reader suddenly stopped working on new PCs. FeedLab has a lot of customization and features for reading your daily list of news, and it’s updated regularly. While the app is free, it’s supported by ads, but they’re easy to remove if you’re willing to support the dev with a one-time ad removal fee that’s essentially the price of a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThMOTy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925442" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ws5uBW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P2iPtb"&gt;PowerToys&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerToys for Windows" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUJ-0tfAwWUhibKp4Eio2FQeCsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19983955/zV54Lfn.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerToys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ms3jZ"&gt;Microsoft’s PowerToys for Windows are essential if you want more customization over how Windows works. There are a variety of tools available, including utilities to keep your PC awake, a system-wide color picking tool, and a FancyZones window manager that lets you quickly position apps into different layouts. One of my favorite PowerToys is Run, which acts as a Mac-like launcher to let you find apps and files or quickly search the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZRd7wc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925447" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="58406Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tq27OF"&gt;OneNote&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OneNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XIO69PsqEkrERgC_dPCw7wyHCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098097/vX7MPdy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneNote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kWpM4C"&gt;I use OneNote daily to arrange my notes for work and sync them across my PC, laptop, and phone. OneNote is free and fully featured and allows you to divide notes into separate notebooks, sections, and pages. It also fully supports inking, so if you want to take actual notes with a stylus, then it’s ideal. I’d highly recommend this app to students and those who need to take notes regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T5hsiO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925463" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RLNLGN"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="geAvyW"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Adobe Photoshop Express" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Gg8afDCoo-2vg2Ielhg6HtKP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098107/adobe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8gEenq"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express is a free photo editing tool that has all the basics you need. While photo editing in the Photos app in Windows 11 has improved, Photoshop Express includes easy-to-use slide bar adjustments and automatic one-touch fixes. There are also a bunch of correction features and even a spot heal feature that lets you remove blemishes or dirt and dust from photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJDHV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925484" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ceA5ys"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qXToMh"&gt;ShareX&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ShareX" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s0V_73g9FIQZZgBTndS-hln4hoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098103/dHKmHfo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‪ShareX Team‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ShareX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFeaR"&gt;ShareX is the best screenshot tool for Windows 11. It’s a great little power-user utility that will let you quickly crop, doodle, and even create GIFs or screen recordings. You can also snap a screenshot and automatically upload it to Imgur or other file hosting websites with one tap of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nXOjZd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925505" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DYpghA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sz4M7t"&gt;QuickLook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qowk4F"&gt;QuickLook is a great app to install if you’re switching from a Mac to a PC, but it’s useful for seasoned PC users, too. It lets you quickly preview files in File Explorer using your spacebar. It works just like the macOS Quick Look feature — you can hit enter to open the file in its default app or choose a different app. It works well for most file types that you’d want to preview, but GIFs might take an extra few seconds to load. QuickLook is far better than constantly opening files to find the one you’re looking for or squinting at thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J5m82k"&gt;Stardock’s new Start11 app lets you skin the appearance of the Windows 11 Start menu. You can bring back the classic appearance of the Start menu, change the taskbar size, and position it across multiple monitors. Windows 11 users shouldn’t really need to resort to third-party apps just to bring back basic taskbar functionality that has existed in Windows for decades, but until Microsoft addresses this area, Start11 certainly helps. If you’re missing the time and date on multiple monitors, there’s also &lt;a href="https://github.com/martinet101/ElevenClock"&gt;ElevenClock&lt;/a&gt; that will help until Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812258/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-clock-multiple-monitors-start-menu-updates"&gt;brings back this feature next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sTimex"&gt;If you play a lot of PC games, I recommend Dolby Atmos for Headphones. It’s part of the Dolby Access app and will set you back $14.99 for the license, but if you’re a gamer who wants to hear all the footsteps of your enemies, then it’s well worth it. The license also extends to an Xbox, so if you have an Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S, you’ll get full Dolby Atmos support there, too. There’s even a 30-day trial, so you can try Dolby Atmos for Headphones and see if it sounds better than Microsoft’s built-in Windows Sonic spatial sound option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iBqUzz"&gt;Thanks to streaming services, it feels increasingly rare to play local audio or video content on PCs these days, but VLC does it all without any fuss. It’s a free app that supports a variety of codecs, so it should play anything you throw at it. VLC also supports streaming from network locations, so pretty much every video playback scenario is covered with this app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady says the next sideline Surface he yeets will cost him</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8YrAP"&gt;On the Sunday Night Football stage, December 19th, Tom Brady and the Buccaneers were swept for the second consecutive regular season against the Saints — a frustrating shut-out loss that had Brady &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846124/tom-brady-destroy-microsoft-surface-tablet"&gt;spiking a poor Microsoft Surface&lt;/a&gt; tablet on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IhibyQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tom Brady threw the tablet after his INT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFLBrasil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NFLBrasil&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;a href="https://t.co/PyvdFi30NO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyvdFi30NO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1472782726424109061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSgTmN"&gt;Now, per Brady on his Let’s Go podcast &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-division-champs-new-years-resolution"&gt;that aired Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the NFL is not going to let the Surface abuse continue. Should the seven-time Super Bowl champion throw the tablet again, he will be fined. “I did get warned from the NFL about that so... I won’t throw another Surface.” Brady said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LxR3R"&gt;The co-host of the podcast, Jim Gray, joked that the whole incident was just good marketing for Microsoft’s tablet — which has been in use by NFL teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/3/5964307/nfl-replaces-black-and-white-photographs-with-surface-tablets-on-the"&gt;since 2014&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163685/microsoft-nfl-partnership-teams-official-communication-app"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; won a deal to have all 32 NFL teams use them. Gray asked Brady to clarify what exactly the warning from the NFL was; to which Brady responds eloquently: “I can’t throw another Surface, or else I get fined. Imagine that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlswQe"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/recast/524df40b-20f4-5f00-a5e2-e9b1e472e979" height="600" width="600" title="Tom Brady - Division Champs &amp;amp; New Year's Resolution" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQyqZ"&gt;Brady also joked on &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-tough-loss-andrea-bocelli"&gt;last week’s&lt;/a&gt; episode of the Let’s Go podcast: “I didn’t want to throw an interception with that tablet, so I made sure it hit the ground” he said. Brady continued to facetiously chronicle the Surface’s demise: “It was out of use, there was no chance of that one being used after I got a hold of that tablet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDvj0"&gt;“I‘m having a great time playing,” the now 15-time pro bowler said despite the incident “I know it didn’t look like it when I snapped that tablet in half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cN4C6"&gt;It’s not the first time Brady had tossed a Surface in frustration; he threw the tablet last season as well against the Chicago Bears — the game where it looked like he had forgotten what down it was (he later &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-comes-clean-on-fourth-down-gaffe-in-loss-to-bears-in-surprising-tiktok-confession/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; to it on TikTok) and the Bucs ultimately lost by one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJEzjB"&gt;Let’s not totally blame Brady for chucking the tablet though — after all, it was probably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/2/13139174/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface"&gt;nurtured behavior&lt;/a&gt; coming from his legacy in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUICzI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, I spike like 3 tablets a week working on the NYT Mini Crossword. Need to get it under control. “Let’s Go!” is out everywhere now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl"&gt;https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/UKl4P2KPWY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UKl4P2KPWY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Brady (@TomBrady) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1473429623971139590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>A vehicle burned at Canoo’s headquarters after a battery test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPBpwC9YNDV3yoLbUlDD1HtJkL0=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328779/canoo_Design_Exterior_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6U7JXO"&gt;A vehicle at EV startup Canoo burned on August 24th after lithium-ion batteries left inside the car started a fire. The local fire department was able to extinguish the blaze and no one was injured, according to an &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133022/Incident_21_0009517_19951_Mariner_Ave_R.pdf"&gt;incident report&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7J7dx"&gt;The fire happened in the parking lot outside Canoo’s Torrance, California corporate office, which was once the startup’s headquarters — before it started calling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783974/canoo-moves-to-walmart-hometown"&gt;Bentonville, Arkansas home in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4a7Yf"&gt;Canoo’s VP of communications Agnes Gomes-Koizumi confirmed the fire occurred after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; requested comment. “A small fire occurred several hours after the intentionally destructive testing of a battery module,” Gomes said in an e-mailed statement, noting the module passed the test and did not ignite. The fire happened because “someone inappropriately placed the module in a sealed container,” she wrote. “The box the module was placed in became pressurized and resulted in the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUj686"&gt;The car wasn’t one of Canoo’s prototypes, Gomes said, but a third-party cargo vehicle the company had rented or purchased. The incident report lists it as a Ford. Canoo announced a deal to use batteries from Panasonic subsidiary Sanyo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-21-054442/0001213900-21-054442.pdf"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear who made the batteries involved in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q80ekY"&gt;Canoo is working towards a goal of starting production on its electric vans in late 2022, though it has also been turning over executives along the way — including, this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22839732/canoo-cto-cofounders-resign-shakeup-leadership-tony-aquila"&gt;losing its chief technology officer and two of the five remaining co-founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8seUF"&gt;The company joins some other EV startups in dealing with battery fires. One of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17930524/faraday-future-evergrande-investment-jia-yueting-fire"&gt;preproduction vehicles caught fire in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, a prototype of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck &lt;a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire"&gt;caught fire in February 2021&lt;/a&gt; during a road test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUktZ"&gt;Those other fires originated from battery packs that were powering the respective prototype vehicles. Canoo’s fire started in the cabin of the third-party vehicle, according to the report, where lithium-ion batteries were “being transported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytKMMH"&gt;After the fire was extinguished, an officer from Los Angeles County’s Health Hazmat team was called to the scene to help investigate the battery explosion. The remains of the batteries were placed in a “trash can filled with water,” per Health Hazmat’s instructions. The Torrance Fire Department’s report says the fire did an estimated $45,000 worth of damage, including $10,000 in property damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSStnU"&gt;The fire department was on the scene for three and a half hours, though the report doesn’t say how long it took to extinguish the blaze. “The facility was opened the next day and has been functioning normally,” Gomes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Arxv"&gt;The report lists “improper container or storage procedure” and “[u]nattended or unsupervised person” as factors that contributed to the fire. Torrance Fire Department did not respond to multiple emailed requests for comment, and LA County’s Health Hazmat team declined to make someone available for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite servers were down for five hours, but now the game is back online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic Games Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kerJIQNLD405nGgnwCeXMgbZ6ms=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70327592/1232679117.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lwqJZ8"&gt;There was some bad news if you’re on winter break and hoping to play some &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as Epic Games battle royale shooter went down more than five hours on Wednesday — and this time it wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;to help expand the game’s lore&lt;/a&gt;. According to a tweet from its own &lt;a href="https://status.epicgames.com/incidents/gfv5zzrn0nv4"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue. We’ll provide more info when we have a solution to bring services back online.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="c1ur9f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fortnite game servers are back online and the Winterfest continues! ❄️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We appreciate everyone’s understanding as we worked to resolve these issues and we’ll have more details next week on what we’re doing to help you make up for lost time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ruLmG4xHgk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ruLmG4xHgk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476339842028036099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qm6r8k"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476284634971484163"&gt;follow-up tweet at 3:10PM ET&lt;/a&gt; from the team said they were “continuing to work on a fix that will bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back online and appreciate everyone’s patience.” As of 6PM ET, we hadn’t heard anything since, but at around 6:30PM ET players reported the game was working again, which we have been able to confirm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v91CAN"&gt;The Fortnite Status Twitter eventually &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476339842028036099"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to confirm the game is back up, promising that next week (or, next year) there will be details on “what we’re doing to help you make up for lost time.” It also noted some people might see an extra in-game present to open, but said the team is working on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSQvSH"&gt;Our own senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster reported &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1476220645801447433"&gt;struggling with the platform&lt;/a&gt;, which was telling many players, “You do not have permission to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.” The company started investigating the issue at around 11AM ET, before the servers went offline entirely a couple of hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Vub9FT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fortnite is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll provide more info when we have a solution to bring services back online. &lt;a href="https://t.co/B3wXvu5SL6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3wXvu5SL6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476254959054245898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8PPa0"&gt;When the servers initially went down, the Epic Games launcher wouldn’t even start &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, showing the servers were offline, but later it would try to launch the game. Unfortunately, after launching, as many players have reported and we experienced in a test, it simply placed you in a queue for ten minutes or so and then failed to connect. Now, as of 6:45PM ET, launching the game takes players right in to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxmanM"&gt;Around the same time the issue started, the Epic Games Store was also having problems, where some players said they couldn’t log in or even access their games for offline play. Now at least the Epic Games desktop launcher is working so you can still play other games on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK_0rJq3OvCws9YqPVzhFSZzZQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0006.8.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is one of many e-readers currently available as part of a discounted bundle at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. While newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, keep in mind that the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;The 10th-gen Kindle is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest model features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $89.99, its typical retail price. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. Target and Best Buy, meanwhile, are offering $36 off the price of two if you purchase a pair of the ad-supported models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $119.97 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released the Kindle Kids, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHO6IB"&gt;Right now, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though, we did see it drop to $60 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Best is also taking $44 off the cost of two, if you want to purchase a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0EetaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, the ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjh6fhT1VK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230703/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals122921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fall-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-8gb-tablet-black%2F-%2FA-84609459" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $139.99, its full retail price. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as part of a discounted bundle for $249.97, however, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S8bhtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the $20 discount available on the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Bundle — retailers like Amazon and Best Buy often lower the price of the last-gen model to $89.99 during major shopping holidays and limited-time sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYvMzL"&gt;Although the e-reader is not on sale as a standalone device at the moment, Amazon is currently discounting the Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LN58ZH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMT23Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, along with a leather case and power adapter. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5RQ0ML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10953222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;If you’re looking for a discount, the Essentials bundle is on sale at Amazon for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited. Best also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgji2DnWlVT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers the 8GB model with ads&lt;/a&gt; for $249.99, however, the retailer will knock $100 off the final price if you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="hVEvua"&gt;While they certainly aren’t for everyone, the usefulness of Amazon’s Echo devices makes them an excellent value, especially if you have an older model to trade in. Currently, many Echo devices — including the standard fourth-generation Echo, the Echo Show 5, and Echo Show 8 — are selling for the same prices we saw on Black Friday. If you pair that with the potential 25 percent discount you'll receive when you trade in an older Echo device tied to your account, you’ve got a great way to upgrade your home automation setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCMryz"&gt;Amazon’s Echo devices are available at a variety of retailers for the same price, but note that if you’re planning to trade in an older device, you can only do so through Amazon directly.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, all preowned games are buy two, get one free. Buying preowned titles is a great way to save a modest amount on titles that would otherwise be full price, and GameStop often has games that are barely a month old with preowned stickers attached to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjoiYE"&gt;Even if you’re not keen on buying preowned titles, many new titles have been discounted by as much as 50 percent off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9deWBU"&gt;We understand that most games take the shape of a download code these days, but if you have a little extra shelf space or want to clear out some older titles to free up some real estate, these promotions are worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi 12 Pro’s main camera is absolutely massive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqET6mS4OiiBEOijUcVP034qUG0=/0x67:686x524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328001/23b7af4f9dcbdb453c205e6c51479e5a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even for Xiaomi, the 12 and 12 Pro offer huge main camera modules.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qN0wZM"&gt;Xiaomi is at it again — putting another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;fantastically huge camera&lt;/a&gt; on a flagship phone. This time, it’s the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fdiscover%2Farticle%3Fid%3D2603&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F29%2F22858529%2Fxiaomi-12-pro-camera-specifications-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xiaomi 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a 50-megapixel main sensor and f/1.9 standard wide lens. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; biggest sensor Xiaomi has used in a phone, but the combination of a wide aperture lens and sizable imaging chip makes it... well, just look at the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dag6Sd"&gt;On the technical side, it’s a Sony IMX707 chip, which Xiaomi says it’s the first to use in a mobile device. &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/25/xiaomi-12-pro-confirmed-to-use-sony-imx707-sensor-for-primary-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that the 707 appears to be a very light refresh of the IMX700, which makes that claim a little less exciting. Either way, it’s a large 1/1.28-inch type sensor. Sony combines its 1.22μm pixels, which are already fairly large for a mobile camera sensor, to create even larger 2.44μm “4-in-1” pixels for better low-light photos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfOub_Vp8H8dJkV5FgIx3hD-JCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132629/xiaomi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vwrq8U"&gt;The 12 Pro includes two more 50-megapixel rear camera sensors: an ultrawide and a telephoto. The Xiaomi 12 features a slightly smaller 1/1.56-inch type sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel “telemacro.” In addition to impressive hardware, the 12 and 12 Pro include camera software improvements like reduced shutter lag, burst shooting improvements, and subject tracking for human and animal faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9W9QxH"&gt;On the non-camera side, the 12 Pro and its 12 sibling have all the trimmings of a modern flagship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsets and 120Hz OLED panels. The Xiaomi 12 offers a 6.28-inch screen and a 4,500mAh battery; the 12 Pro includes a 6.73-inch screen with 1,500 nit peak brightness and a 4,600mAh battery with 120W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yE8DPs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DZCM8N"&gt;If you’d like to become the proud owner of a really, really big smartphone camera, both go on sale in China on December 31st. The 12 Pro starts at RMB 4,699 (about $737) for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the Xiaomi 12 starts at RMB 3,699 (about $580) for the same 8GB / 128GB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>James Webb Space Telescope’s fuel expected to last more than 10 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="james webb space telescope" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxndwWJKs2pNhgPo97r4zlhfx2Y=/24x0:1077x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70327880/mirror44_lg.1419965238.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="92xgi8"&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;revolutionary and successful launch&lt;/a&gt; of the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, into space on Christmas day, NASA announced some &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/29/nasa-says-webbs-excess-fuel-likely-to-extend-its-lifetime-expectations/"&gt;unexpected news&lt;/a&gt; about the telescope’s future: its science mission is likely to last “significantly more” than 10 years — more than double the minimum time for the mission.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TjXrd"&gt;Initially, JWST was projected to be operational for 5 to 10 years, but NASA’s latest analysis &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/29/nasa-says-webbs-excess-fuel-likely-to-extend-its-lifetime-expectations/"&gt;released today&lt;/a&gt; found that the telescope will likely have enough propellant to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;support scientific operations for even longer. According to NASA, the extra propellant is thanks to the precision of the Ariane 5 rocket that the JWST was on when it was launched into space. It is also due to the precision of the first and second &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/27/more-than-you-wanted-to-know-about-webbs-mid-course-corrections/"&gt;mid-course correction maneuvers&lt;/a&gt; —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;small trajectory tweaks that the spacecraft has completed in the days since launching, setting it on a path toward its destination &lt;a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/orbit.html"&gt;a million miles from Earth&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cWgiQ"&gt;According to NASA, the precision of these maneuvers leaves the spacecraft with more propellant it can use to maintain its final position for observing the cosmos. The space agency warns, however, that “many factors” could ultimately affect JWST’s lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA7U21"&gt;The potential extension of scientific research is reminiscent of the Hubble telescope, which is widely considered JWST’s predecessor. NASA initially projected the Hubble telescope would last about 15 years, but it’s still operating today, more than 30 years later. A key difference between the two is that the Hubble Space Telescope was able to serviced by astronauts while JWST is not. JWST, which collects infrared light, is capable of imaging objects &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;10 to 100 times fainter&lt;/a&gt; than what Hubble can see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DYZ8h"&gt;The launch trajectory’s accuracy also allowed JWST to deploy its solar array a bit early. Following separation from the Ariane 5 rocket, deployment of JWST’s solar array was set to begin about 33 minutes after launch. But it actually happened about 29 minutes after launch because JWST was at the correct position after the separation, NASA said in its press release. However, unlike the solar array deployment which was automatic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzGLKQ7_KZQ"&gt;future deployments&lt;/a&gt;—including the spacecraft’s sunshield and segments of its primary mirror—are going to be human controlled, NASA says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was the year clean energy finally faced its mining problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lithium And Geothermal Power Projects In California’s Imperial Valley" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPt1Dlh4gK387mkwvmwpH80E-mw=/0x0:4929x3286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70327216/1237268708.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6M42J5"&gt;This year, the clean energy sector finally started grappling in earnest with one of its biggest challenges: how to get enough minerals to build solar panels, wind turbines, and big batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage. Figuring that out will be critical for escaping fossil-fueled ecological disaster. It’ll also be crucial for policymakers and industry to move forward without throwing certain communities under the bus in the transition to clean energy.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJvzAM"&gt;Instead of cutting through landscapes with oil and gas wells and pipelines, clean energy industries and their suppliers will open up the Earth to hunt for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper. Compared to a gas-fired power plant, an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more mineral resources, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. Building an EV requires six times more minerals than a gas-powered car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fv0SxW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Move forward without throwing certain communities under the bus &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tWnP4B"&gt;It’s about time to scrutinize what that hunger for minerals might cause, given the recent boom in pledges from countries and companies alike to &lt;a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2021/taking-stock-assessment-net-zero-targets"&gt;reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;. Digging up the necessary minerals is already proving to be a minefield. Protests are popping up at proposed mines that no one really wants in their backyard. The conflicts that cropped up in 2021 are just the beginning of a challenging road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="902lud"&gt;In May, the International Energy Agency (IEA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt;: the world isn’t mining enough of the minerals that are the building blocks of a clean energy future. And supply chains for many critical minerals are vulnerable, according to the IEA’s report. “Left unaddressed, these potential vulnerabilities could make global progress towards a clean energy future slower and more costly – and therefore hamper international efforts to tackle climate change,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in a statement at the time. “This is what energy security looks like in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0T26B"&gt;The cobalt used in EV batteries, for example, mostly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html"&gt;comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of the world’s rare earth minerals, used in EV motors and wind turbines, are produced and processed in China. So if anything rattles production in those countries, the whole world might feel the effects. On top of that, the concentration of power over vital resources in specific countries and companies creates the potential for environmental and human rights abuses, which have plagued supply chains for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/"&gt;rare earth minerals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.raid-uk.org/sites/default/files/report_road_to_ruin_evs_cobalt_workers_nov_2021.pdf"&gt;Investigations&lt;/a&gt; into cobalt mines that are essential suppliers to the EV battery industry have already found widespread labor abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re3Hnk"&gt;To make things harder, the COVID-19 pandemic has put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785274/clean-renewable-energy-supply-chain-crisis-climate-mining-manufacturing"&gt;even more pressure&lt;/a&gt; on clean energy supply chains. Rising shipping and commodity prices could delay or even cancel solar projects slated for 2022, according to research firm &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;Rystad Energy&lt;/a&gt;. Soaring metal prices could slow down the entire transition to renewable energy throughout the decade, says the &lt;a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2021/11/10/soaring-metal-prices-may-delay-energy-transition/"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOwunw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;where labor abuses are a big problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NFFF8"&gt;Regardless, Joe Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;halving its emissions from peak levels&lt;/a&gt; this decade. Longer term, he’s pushing for a clean-energy grid by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2050. In order to reach those goals, the US will need large quantities of minerals, which is why the Biden administration has made securing them a priority since stepping into office this year. By June, Biden had &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a “whole-of-government” effort to shore up domestic supply chains, with a big focus on critical minerals and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;advanced batteries&lt;/a&gt; used for renewable energy and electric vehicles. As the administration sees it, domestic supply chains can help the US wean itself off dirty fossil fuels, while also minimizing its reliance on mining in other countries — especially where labor abuses are a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Representatives of The San Carlos Apache Nation Hold Protest Protest Over Land Swap Within The Nat’l Defense Authorization Act" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gTVj-KIm_srFyr2uPslGMPLsABo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132148/481583360.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Members of the the San Carlos Apache Nation pray outside the US Capitol while protesting a land swap included in the National Defense Authorization Act that “threatens the sacred Apache Leap site with environmental damage from nearby high-risk copper” July 22nd, 2015 in Washington, DC. Oak Flat is home to centuries of Apache traditional coming-of-age ceremonies and acorn gathering customs, had been under federal protection for over 55 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FCMG5e"&gt;But even in the US, clean energy-related mining can come with costs, and it’s already looking like Native Americans and other marginalized groups might bear a disproportionate burden of those costs. One high-profile tussle is building up at Nevada’s &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;Thacker Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the largest lithium resource in the country. If a proposed lithium mine moves forward, it will dig up a potential gravesite that’s sacred to members of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes and other local tribes. Residents are also &lt;a href="https://www.sierranevadaally.org/2021/05/20/people-of-red-mountain-statement-of-opposition-to-lithium-nevada-corps-proposed-thacker-pass-open-pit-lithium-mine/"&gt;worried&lt;/a&gt; about how the mine might harm wildlife and use up water in a state suffering a historic drought. The Nez Perce Tribe in Idaho faces the prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=Climate+news%3A&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TDC+Daily"&gt;a new mining project tearing up their landscape&lt;/a&gt; to produce gold, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270960/electronic-waste-urban-mining-materials-recycling"&gt;key ingredient&lt;/a&gt; for many electronics, and antimony, that could be used in futuristic batteries. Then there’s the proposed copper mine at Oak Flat in Arizona that would &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona/2021/08/18/oak-flat-apache-sacred-resolution-copper-mine/7903887002/"&gt;desecrate lands sacred to members of the San Carlos Apache Nation&lt;/a&gt; and other Indigenous peoples in the region. Copper is widely used across the grid and for solar and wind energy technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9syz8c"&gt;Around the world, the race is on to find new sources of the minerals needed for clean energy. Mining companies are now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16398518/deep-sea-mining-hydrothermal-vents-japan-precious-metals-rare-species"&gt;eyeing patches of the seafloor&lt;/a&gt; that contain polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt, rare earth elements, and other metals. While companies argue that mining the seafloor is one way to avoid polluting communities near land-based mines, their eagerness to bring heavy industry to a largely unexplored environment has alarmed hundreds of marine scientists, who published a &lt;a href="https://www.seabedminingsciencestatement.org/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; in September saying such activity could irreparably hurt deep-sea ecosystems. Despite their concerns, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which oversees activities on the high seas, is seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com./magazine/2022/01/03/mining-the-bottom-of-the-sea"&gt;poised&lt;/a&gt; to push through new rules that could &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2021/12/deep-sea-mining-regulators-latest-meeting-on-rules-only-muddies-the-water/"&gt;open up the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; for deep sea-mining after convening earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7cNVGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; Tribes are entitled to “free, prior, and informed consent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjgS8u"&gt;There are ways to get the minerals the clean energy revolution needs while minimizing the impact on people and the planet. Startups are figuring out how to get better at recycling lithium batteries. Joe Biden campaigned on a promise to create millions of clean energy jobs while defending workers’ right to unionize, which might offer workers in US mines more protections. Tribes are entitled to “free, prior, and informed consent” to any project that might affect them or their territories, under the &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/ipeoples/freepriorandinformedconsent.pdf"&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/a&gt;. We can also boost energy efficiency, use more public transit, and consume less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FD7hik"&gt;As renewable energy starts to outpace fossil fuels, it will need to avoid the ways coal, oil, and gas bulldozed through communities at great costs to people and the environment. And if decision-makers can chart a path for a just transition to renewable energy, they might be able to heal more than the damage our demand for energy has inflicted on the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTWjwg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqosqb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
