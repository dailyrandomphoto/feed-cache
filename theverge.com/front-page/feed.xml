    <title>Kevin Hart signs deal with Netflix for four exclusive movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 Winter TCA Tour - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44RSgIboZAYvxamONck_iMbrHTA=/0x34:2973x2016/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651981/1198527349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Sussman / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1vrj6"&gt;Netflix has signed &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/kevin-hart-along-with-hartbeat-productions-ink-exclusive-partnership-with"&gt;a multiyear deal with Kevin Hart&lt;/a&gt; and his production company HartBeat Productions for four exclusive films starring Hart and first dibs on films the comedy star develops with his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YT7Rh"&gt;Hart partnered with Netflix most recently for his comedy special &lt;em&gt;Zero F**ks Given,&lt;/em&gt; which Netflix says was the “#1 Netflix comedy special in 2020,” but this new deal would bring the lucrative comedy star even deeper into the fold. Hart’s films have grossed a combined $4 billion in the global box office, according to Netflix, so taking advantage of that star power to draw users to the streaming service and keep them around makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UboHUV"&gt;Relying on recognizable comedy stars has been a successful formula for Netflix. Adam Sandler’s deal with the company has produced films that consistently rank among the top of Netflix’s charts. Sandler’s films on Netflix have been so popular that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019"&gt;Netflix has renewed its deal with the former &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; star twice&lt;/a&gt; just to keep him around. Beyond that, Hart and Sandler share a similar broad appeal, generally enjoyed by all ages in the US and fans around the world. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21142065/netflix-streaming-wars-subscriber-growth-disney-international"&gt;Netflix expands globally&lt;/a&gt;, films with stars who are recognizable everywhere become more and more important to keep growing its subscriber base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQmbGd"&gt;Hart’s not without his controversies — most notably, a pattern of homophobic behavior (and tweets) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18131221/kevin-hart-oscar-hosting-homophobia-twitter-tweets"&gt;that cost him a gig hosting the Academy Awards in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The star has since &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/kevin-hart-oscar-controversy-looking-back"&gt;acknowledged his mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, but Hart’s past remarks could be a concern for some Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dickinson’s second season trades death for fame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiM1UN0z03sOspJS7L9gwFDnlBU=/126x0:1314x792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651910/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_3.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UK0uk6"&gt;Writing is often the domain of obsessives, and Emily Dickinson — at least, the witty, chaotic version of her portrayed by Hailee Steinfeld on Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; — gives herself over to her obsessions fully. In the first season of the show, which is an irreverent, &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the life of the famed young poet, her obsession was Death, played by Wiz Khalifa. (Like I said: irreverent.) In the latest season, Steinfeld’s Emily is obsessed with fame. Lovers of dramatic irony have a lot to dig into here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brnbxJ"&gt;The new season of &lt;em&gt;Dickinson &lt;/em&gt;is a lot like the first: equal parts over-the-top comedy and earnest teen soap. But this time around, the show has a touch more restraint. It keeps the outrageous excess — &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is still an anachronistic comedy whose teens behave as if they were in a modern CW soap, while its adults are all caricatures of 19th century historical figures — but it builds in a little more self-control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Deuqiw"&gt;In the show’s first season, the ethos of transgression for transgression’s sake resulted in some moments of poor taste; the show, which is about teens in white middle-class Amherst, would frequently drop hip-hop beats to underline how edgy they were, for example. The series often undermined its irreverence by calling too much attention to it, and if there’s one big improvement in what’s been shown of season 2 so far — the first three episodes of which are streaming now — it’s in that particular regard. In season 2, &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is content to merely be the show it is: which is, in fact, pretty great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy5nVe"&gt;In the second season’s premiere, &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; breaks the proverbial fourth wall and addresses the viewer directly, calling attention to the difference between the show and the actual history of Emily Dickinson’s life. It notes, curiously, that the story is moving into a portion of Emily’s life that is not as well-documented: the start of what would be a 30-year seclusion where the only thing scholars know she did for sure was write, and write &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Future episodes may or not make this clear, but this kind of prologue makes you wonder about the show’s intent. &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is a tongue-in-cheek retelling of history that’s already inventing a lot. What might noting the ambiguity of historical record signal? &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; departures from history? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qn3iQq"&gt;And so &lt;em&gt;Dickinson’&lt;/em&gt;s new season wrestles with what could have been. Emily is tempted to forgo her longstanding practice of writing only for herself and her friend and former paramour Sue — who’s now in a troubled marriage with Emily’s brother Austin — and she’s entertaining the thought of being published. Meanwhile, new players enter. Samuel Bowles (Finn Jones), the editor of the &lt;em&gt;Springfield Republican&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;might have an interest in publishing her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQiYTz"&gt;Returning characters have their storylines develop. Henry (Chinaza Uche), a Black man who does work for the Dickinsons, for example, is starting to secretly publish and organize Amherst’s Black community. This is all to say that the second season of &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is starting to make a more pronounced effort to be more than a progressive take on a white woman’s story, albeit one played by an actor of color. It seems to have ambitions to be a progressive and very funny take on the era as a whole, and that makes the world of the show even richer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMX9Jx"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;, Emily’s world is expanding, even as we know from history that tragedy looms. Soon, she will recede from the world; soon, the nation will split in two and erupt in open warfare; and soon, all of these young people will find their perceptions of their equally young nation challenged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2lPuP"&gt;It’s the sort of thing Emily would write a poem about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Yd24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdcGDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Western Digital doubles the storage in its portable SSDs to 4TB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ki4Dpnl_YcWLBsSWUNJkFjLl2PE=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651809/WD_4tb_ssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ouv9KO"&gt;Western Digital is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F2021-01-11-western-digital-delivers-unmatched-line-up-of-high-capacity-portable-ssds&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225044%2Fwestern-digital-portable-ssds-storage-4tb-price-announced#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;doubling the maximum storage size&lt;/a&gt; of several of its portable SSDs to 4TB. Previously, Western Digital’s SSD lineup maxed out at 2TB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtAgGE"&gt;The 4TB storage configuration will be available under Western Digital’s My Passport and WD_Black black brands, along with its subsidiary SanDisk’s Extreme series. All of the products will also include a five-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcCw24"&gt;Starting at $680, Western Digital’s My Passport SSD, which received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/20/21376091/western-digital-my-passport-ssd-portable-storage-backup-second-gen-faster"&gt;model refresh last August&lt;/a&gt;, promises up to 1050MB/s read speeds and 1000MB/s write speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THuwtQrJtr0xZn2WCZCYfKHYNvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227999/WD_Black_P50_TopOrtho_LightOn_3.jpg.thumb.840.840.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD is great for console gamers looking for an external device to store their games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n3cM1c"&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD 4TB configuration will retail for $750 and include read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. This external SSD is compatible with PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKoVKE"&gt;But buyer beware: if you are looking to buy this as an external SSD to supplement the storage on your PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, there are a few caveats. It can connect to the PS5, but you can only store PS4 games. And while it will work on the Xbox Series X / S, this game drive is not compatible with the next-gen console's SSD expansion output to take full advantage of the next-gen hardware. Currently, the one SSD that takes full advantage of the Series X / S’s hardware is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181854/microsoft-xbox-series-x-expansion-cards-removable-storage-support-features"&gt;Seagate’s Expansion Card&lt;/a&gt;, which only comes in 1TB. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEZmsgECEmfYYVy3b-sjgFROr8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21923934/SanDisk_Extreme_Portable_SSD_Front_HR.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SanDisk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the SanDisk Extreme and Extreme Pro received a model refresh last September.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4RD1x"&gt;The SanDisk Extreme’s 4TB configuration will cost $700 and promises transfer speeds of up to 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write. An even faster option, the 4TB Extreme Pro, will cost $900 and delivers both read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UKJ7a"&gt;Western Digital says all of these products are expected to launch “later this calendar quarter” on its website and the Western Digital website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite streamer TheGrefg broke Twitch records with more than 2 million concurrent viewers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SdvkCJtmYcN0s8qxzPmxtuKhErg=/0x26:1718x1171/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.04.49_PM_3.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ggXcy5"&gt;Spanish streamer and EU Heretics team owner &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegrefg"&gt;David “TheGrefg” Martínez&lt;/a&gt; smashed the concurrent record on Twitch today, with more than 2 million live viewers tuning in to watch him reveal his Icon series &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin. His excitement was palpable, and viewers watched live as Martínez googled Twitch’s previous records on his own record-breaking stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12UEPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Icon Series skins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;are reserved for the game’s top creators&lt;/a&gt;, which include people like Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten and Tyler “Ninja” Blevins. As of this writing, &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Icon_Series_Outfits"&gt;there are only seven outfits in the series&lt;/a&gt;; Martínez’s would be the 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icQATF"&gt;Martínez takes the individual concurrent record from Blevins, who previously had the record for the highest number of concurrents on an individual stream, at 635,000, &lt;a href="https://www.ginx.tv/en/fortnite/thegrefg-s-fortnite-galactus-stream-becomes-most-watched-in-twitch-history"&gt;set in March 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Though this isn’t the first time that Martínez has broken Blevins’ record: he hit 660,000 live viewers during December’s big &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rnBqf"&gt;The stream also set a new record for Twitch period. &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/channels/peak-viewers"&gt;According to TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt;, Martínez far exceeded the 1.1 million viewer record held by esports league ELEAGUE TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1OGC64"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzFFZFT302M?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xeWSpA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stream has now passed more than 2 million concurrents, taking the all-time record on Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0LQEtKWhLDkKqCyM37jlAATz2M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651597/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event will kick off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the big day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differentiate in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in a leaked preorder ad for the S21 Ultra. And of course, Samsung may surprise us with things that we don’t know about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJz7gG"&gt;Here’s the rundown of what we think we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TqiJEm"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra will support the S Pen stylus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkXzfavWpoqmOlrYslGSJLU78-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226167/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_1608287647_0_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U8SR"&gt;Let’s talk about the Ultra flagship first. The big new feature for the S21 Ultra is support for the S Pen stylus, as confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt;. However, the stylus is rumored to be an optional accessory, and the phone isn’t rumored to have a dedicated slot to store it, unlike the company’s Note series of phones. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; images of an optional case that allows you to store the S Pen, though, so that might be a useful accessory to pick up to help you not lose the stylus. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the S Pen will cost just under €40, which translates to just under $49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1dLQd"&gt;As for cameras, the Ultra will apparently have four back cameras, including 3X &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10X telephoto cameras, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those telephoto cameras are also expected to have optical image stabilization and a 10-megapixel resolution. The phone may also have Samsung’s 100X “Space Zoom” feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132870/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-zoom-100x-space-optical-hybrid-digital-periscope"&gt;first debuted in the Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcHFUh"&gt;The other two back cameras are rumored to be a 108-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the selfie camera may be 40 megapixels. The phone could also have laser-assisted autofocus, something that was included with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79T64A"&gt;You can get a closer look at the rumored camera setup for the Ultra in this leaked marketing image from &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rumored cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDMfVq"&gt;The Ultra is also expected to have a 6.8-inch WQHD+ (3200 x 1440) resolution display, according to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also expected to support a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1346342403792273413"&gt;leaker Ice Universe&lt;/a&gt; says the S21 Ultra may be able to run at that full WQHD+ resolution with the 120Hz refresh rate, something that the S20 Ultra couldn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWM6E3"&gt;The S21 Ultra is also rumored to support 5G networks, be IP68 certified for water and dust resistance, have a 5,000mAh battery, and come with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a7lbvG"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will offer similar specs at different sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSMaghhXENSxKlIePS1XTqEfCNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226095/42240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14BTZ"&gt;Samsung also plans to announce the Samsung S21 and S21 Plus, which won’t have quite as powerful specs as the Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SIeKj"&gt;The most obvious difference between the S21 and S21 Plus is a smaller camera module. The two phones are expected to have a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And both phones will reportedly have a 10-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jhke"&gt;Here’s a better look at the cameras on the S21, thanks to another leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yhor9DKX7P2whgS81d6AC-kqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226116/e621085f8ae9e2b7f52b30e774a0648f163650b16b9f84df9afe07c77759bbd3.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus’ rumored camera setups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddghEu"&gt;As for screens, the standard S21 is expected to have a 6.2-inch display with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution, while the S21 Plus is rumored to have a 6.7-inch screen with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. Both are expected to support a 120Hz refresh rate screen as well, though it apparently won’t be an adaptive refresh rate, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="117x1F"&gt;Like the Ultra, both the S21 and S21 Plus are expected to support 5G networks and be IP68-certified. They’re also expected to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And depending on which model you buy, they’ll have different battery sizes: the smaller S21 is rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery, while the S21 Plus is expected to have a 4,800mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py3yCA"&gt;Each phone is also rumored to have a different back cover material. The S21 could have a plastic back, while the S21 Plus may have a glass back, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OG7VjD"&gt;The S21 lineup may not include a power charger in the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q72Bf7"&gt;Samsung’s newest phones may take a cue from Apple by not including a charger in the box, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s reports about the &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;S21, S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. And the company recently deleted ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;mocking Apple&lt;/a&gt; for not including a charger with the iPhone 12 lineup, lending credence to rumors that Samsung will be making a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meFNfx"&gt;While the decision could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;a good one for the environment&lt;/a&gt;, keep in mind that if you’re thinking about picking up an S21, you may also need to consider purchasing a separate charging brick to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCf341"&gt;The new phones may run Samsung’s One UI 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj3VlO"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup may run One UI 3.1, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD3a6gHZeQ"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Jimmy is Promo reveals some of the features that could be coming in the new update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TBEzw3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aD3a6gHZeQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRol9y"&gt;The video, which apparently demonstrates One UI 3.1 running on the S21 Ultra, shows off a way to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, some of the S Pen features that work on the S21 Ultra, backgrounds for the call screen, the ability to select video resolution from the video recording screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvS9V2"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds could compete with the AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-amUOc2hMjU11V5IlVrzpQ14fis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226131/e31b969143b271229f5243aae0fc864fd5f050c10f701deba1a172fab2d354f7.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s rumored Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Det9wn"&gt;In addition to its S21 slate of phones, Samsung is also heavily rumored to announce a new set of true wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro. Not only have they been revealed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;preorder freebie&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra in a leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;shared by Blass&lt;/a&gt;, but YouTuber Digital Slang has already posted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; and comparisons with the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GDIfgKm0Zeg"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9cJJVFJkFgU"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NtfL99"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGUMP0xsio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3prOX"&gt;The new earbuds are rumored to have active noise cancelation, an eight-hour battery life (up to 28 hours with the charging case), and an IPX7 water / sweat rating. You can see how the Galaxy Buds Pro compare to some of Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds in this leaked spec sheet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro may cost $199, making them a more affordable alternative to $249 Apple’s AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hLHE2"&gt;Samsung may launch its Tile-like item tracker called the Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJQ7mSqcubi_fODBqbacWlaryb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208211/smarttagleak.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9flwoY"&gt;Samsung’s rumored new Tile-like Galaxy SmartTag will apparently use Bluetooth to connect with devices and share its location. The tag itself looks to be a small square with rounded corners and a loop at the top to make it easier to attach to things, as shown in photos posted on the website of Taiwan’s telecom regulator &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;and shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design in the photos also matches an image of the SmartTag in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;leaked ad&lt;/a&gt; of preorder bonuses for the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izd5pO"&gt;It seems likely that the SmartTags will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s new SmartThings Find app&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you track the locations of your Galaxy devices, similar to Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s second-gen ultrasonic fingerprint reader is bigger and faster than the original</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLJTb5TnY3zgOeiE3jFJfOC6Ulo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651590/akrales_190228_3255_0065.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2MjdJq"&gt;Qualcomm has just announced the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, the latest version of its ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor that looks to improve on the original model in nearly every way. The new version offers a larger surface area for the sensor and faster processing to unlock phones even quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Zuro"&gt;The company is making a big jump here: the new Gen 2 model measures 8mm x 8mm, compared to the 4mm x 9mm surface area of the first-generation model, for 77 percent more surface area. In turn, that means it’ll be easier to accurately place your finger on the sensor, and it allows for the sensor to collect more data with each scan. By combining the larger sensor with faster processing, Qualcomm promises that scanning a fingerprint to unlock a phone will go 50 percent faster with the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up4e1BMF_zgWS-2RlhNPuE9KKFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225984/3D_Sonic_Sensor_Gen_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCM3Mj"&gt;Qualcomm’s first-generation ultrasonic sensor — the 3D Sonic Sensor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;made its debut in the Galaxy S10 lineup of phones in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, nearly every other in-display reader used an optical scanner, which was said to be slower and less reliable than the new ultrasonic one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmQLD3"&gt;But the reality turned out to be the opposite: the first-generation 3D Sonic Sensor ran into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/7/18299366/samsung-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-sensor-fooled-3d-printed-fingerprint"&gt;numerous issues&lt;/a&gt;, including a highly problematic security flaw that caused the readers to unlock phones with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919026/samsung-galaxy-s10-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensor-security-flaw-screen-cover-protector"&gt;almost any fingerprint&lt;/a&gt; when used with some screen protectors. (Samsung would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929178/samsung-galaxy-s10-note-1o-fingerprint-recognition-issue-patch-ultrasonic-sensor"&gt;fix the problem&lt;/a&gt; with a software update.) And the company &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-20-fingerprint-reader-fooled-screen-protectors/"&gt;recently issued&lt;/a&gt; another patch for the Galaxy Note 20 lineup, addressing similar screen protector problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUoTUt"&gt;The new sensor is technically the third under-display ultrasonic fingerprint reader from Qualcomm, following the original 3D Sonic Sensor and the 3D Sonic Max (introduced in 2019) — which was effectively just a much larger version of the first-gen sensor, but it lacked any real speed improvements. While the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2 doesn’t quite match the 3D Sonic Max’s sensor (which measured a whopping 20mm x 30mm) in size, the speed improvements should more than make up for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeEriI"&gt;Qualcomm says that the first phones to feature that new 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2 should be available in “early 2021.” The company doesn’t mention any partners or more specific timing in its announcement, but it’s worth noting that Samsung is expected to announce its latest Galaxy S21 devices on January 14th. Samsung is the biggest customer for Qualcomm’s ultrasonic fingerprint readers so far, having previously used them in its S10, Note 10, S20, and Note 20 lineups for the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC settles with photo storage app that pivoted to facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JX0iqJ2Xr7lhXU-tOPQeIT9HFhY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651587/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xZT0O"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has reached a settlement with photo storage app Ever that it says used customers’ photos to develop facial recognition technology without telling them, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers"&gt;the agency announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wgdcd"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/everalbum_order.pdf"&gt;terms of the agreement&lt;/a&gt;, Everalbum Inc. is required to delete photos and videos of its users who deactivated their accounts, as well as any facial recognition algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos. The company also must delete all “face embeddings,” which it describes as “data reflecting facial features that can be used for facial recognition purposes” that were derived from users’ photos who didn’t give consent for their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEB8AY"&gt;Everalbum, which &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"&gt;shut down Ever in August and rebranded itself as Paravision AI&lt;/a&gt;, is also prohibited from misrepresenting how it collects and uses personal information and how it protects users’ privacy. If it markets software to consumers for personal use, the company has to obtain express consent before using any biometric information it collects from users to create face embeddings or to develop facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyjqkK"&gt;In a 2019 report, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; detailed how Ever&lt;/a&gt; launched as a cloud storage business in 2013, but then switched to be a facial recognition technology provider four years later because it realized its photo app “wasn’t going to be a venture-scale business.” The report found that the Ever app was using customer’s private photos to train its facial recognition algorithm, which it then sold to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92kiAV"&gt;The company said at the time that it never shared personal user data. Its privacy policy said “Your files may be used to help improve and train our products and these technologies,” but with little detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AC4YI"&gt;Photo services often use facial recognition to classify photos — &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/google-gets-sued-over-face-recognition-joining-facebook-shutterfly-battle-over-2330278"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11605068/facebook-photo-tagging-lawsuit-biometric-privacy"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/16/11934456/apple-google-facial-recognition-photos-privacy-faceprint"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; have all been criticized in the past for their systems over privacy concerns — and large &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18564043/photo-storage-app-ever-facial-recognition-secretly-trained-ai"&gt;photo databases are often used&lt;/a&gt; by companies to train their facial recognition algorithms. Still, those services request extensive permissions from the user, and it’s extremely rare for a photo service to pivot entirely into facial recognition without notifying users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqMuqo"&gt;According to the FTC, Everalbum told users that it would delete photos and videos of users who deactivated their accounts, but the agency said the company had failed to do so through at least October 2019, instead retaining them indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVRFka"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Paravision spokesperson said the FTC order “reflects a change that has already taken place,” and the company has “no plans to run a consumer business moving forward.” Paravision’s face recognition model does not use any Ever users’ data, the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0sEKK"&gt;“Face recognition and computer vision technology have the potential to improve our lives in profound ways and we take the gravity of its impacts extremely seriously,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Paravision has been &lt;a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html"&gt;recognized&lt;/a&gt; as an “accurate provider” of face recognition technology. “We look forward to maintaining this position with our latest generation model, and are deeply committed to the ethical development and use of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTvRkm"&gt;Keeping up with every single streaming service is an expensive affair, but Hulu is offering US college students a special discounted &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstudent&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225329%2Fhulu-college-student-discount-ads-watch-party-offline-download#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plan at $2 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, Hulu’s ad-supported plan costs $5.99 a month. The new student plan, which is an evergreen offer and will run for the same price as long as students can verify their continued enrollment, offers more than a 65 percent discount. Students can sign up for the offer now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBrUEO"&gt;Hulu has made offers like this in the past for general subscribers (not just college students), but those were limited time deals. Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/11/26/black-friday-2020-hulu-black-friday-deal-too-good-miss/6431679002/"&gt;Black Friday sale&lt;/a&gt;, for example, saw the cost go down to $2 a month for an entire year. These are all for ad-supported plans, though. Hulu’s ad-free plan remains much more costly, coming in at $11.99 a month and putting it on the same pricing shelf as Netflix ($13.99 a month for its most popular plan) and HBO Max ($14.99 a month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdAW28"&gt;Still, for college students just looking to watch new FX shows on Hulu or dig into bad reality TV or procedural drama marathons, it’s a pretty good deal. Hulu also now allows people to join in on watch parties, which allow subscribers to watch shows and movies together while apart. The only downside (other than having to deal with ads) is that Hulu’s discounted tier doesn’t allow offline viewing, so don’t expect to watch episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;on the go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market just had its first big growth in 10 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DK-er7w1oD9USCb_UkXS5toOnwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651435/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7x3ku"&gt;The PC was supposed to die 10 years ago, but it’s just experienced its first big growth in a decade. Market research firm &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-pc-market-Q4-2020?ctid=1906-7fad0e51797053191ee1cfe45c29812b"&gt;Canalys reports&lt;/a&gt; that PC shipments reached 297 million units in 2020, up an impressive 11 percent from 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47274421"&gt;IDC puts the year&lt;/a&gt; at 302 million shipments, up 13.1 percent year over year. &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-10-point-7-percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2020-and-4-point-8-percent-for-the-year"&gt;Gartner also agrees&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 was a big year for PCs and the biggest growth we’ve seen since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aeyohg"&gt;PC shipments are up thanks to demand related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Supply constraints made it difficult to buy a new laptop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21279633/laptop-pc-shortages-supply-chain-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;halfway through the year&lt;/a&gt;, and demand continued throughout 2020. “Demand is pushing the PC market forward and all signs indicate this surge still has a way to go,” says IDC’s Ryan Reith. While home working and remote learning have been big drivers, people are also turning to PCs and laptops for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPXjA6y9G00Ngvbdd2U88wTKSDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22046476/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air with M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CnkPD6"&gt;“The obvious drivers for last year’s growth centered around work from home and remote learning needs, but the strength of the consumer market should not be overlooked,” says Reith. “We continue to see gaming PCs and monitor sales at all-time highs and Chrome-based devices are expanding beyond education into the consumer market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dfd9F"&gt;There were other signs throughout 2020 that PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319750/pc-shipments-coronavirus-pandemic-idc-gartner-q2-2020"&gt;shipments were surging&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft declared “the PC is back” at the beginning of the pandemic, and the company also saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;big jump in Windows usage&lt;/a&gt; after reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support"&gt;1 billion Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft also adjusted its Windows 10X plans as a result of the pandemic and increased PC demand. 10X was originally supposed to launch on dual-screen devices, but Microsoft is now planning to launch the OS variant on single-screen laptop devices first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQoHuR"&gt;PCs were central to how companies quickly went digital or allowed workers to continue remotely in 2020. “The digital transformation the world has undertaken over the past year is unparalleled, and PCs were at the heart of this change,” says Canalys research director Rushabh Doshi. “It is going to be extremely difficult to write off the PC as some of us did a few years ago. PCs are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev0wKy"&gt;I’ve long argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/9/9115503/post-pc-is-just-pc"&gt;there’s no such thing as a “post-PC” era&lt;/a&gt;, and 2020 certainly proved how valuable laptops and PCs are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3AlLI"&gt;Canalys and IDC both agree that Lenovo was the top PC vendor in 2020, followed by HP in second place, and Dell in third. Apple also saw impressive growth with its shipments up 17 percent, according to Canalys, or as high as 29 percent based on IDC’s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5e7pK"&gt;Apple has also impressed reviewers and industry experts with its new Arm-based M1 chip. It puts the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air back at the top&lt;/a&gt; of laptop recommendations and will set the stage for a battle of laptop processors for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAh8Y9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 11th 4PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Gartner PC shipment report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>D-Link made a USB adapter that adds Wi-Fi 6 to your laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="D-Link Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ni7mhrmg-5OuNO55XOaBveaoD9w=/0x0:1659x1106/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651194/DWA_X1850_A1_Image_L_Side_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: D-Link&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1pFirI"&gt;D-Link is trying to make it simple to give your computer a Wi-Fi upgrade. The networking company has announced what it’s calling an “industry-first” Wi-Fi 6 adapter built into a USB stick. Plug it into your laptop or desktop computer, and you may be able to get better performance than from your older Wi-Fi chip. The adapter advertises speeds up to 1,200Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krvSE2"&gt;It’s not entirely clear who the target audience is for this upgrade. You’ll need to be connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router to get the biggest benefits, and most people still don’t own one of those (the Wi-Fi 6 standard only started rolling out two years ago). And if the laptop or desktop you’re using was bought any time in recent memory, chances are it supports Wi-Fi 5, which isn’t a huge step down from Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q6rZka"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6: is it really that much faster? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Q99vXE"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 does come with some benefits, though. Devices that support it can communicate with routers more efficiently, which can lead to improved performance across a network. Wi-Fi 6 devices also support more secure connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyTXBZ"&gt;The adapter will be available in the second quarter of 2021 for $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auBjq4"&gt;D-Link is also announcing two new Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers, both of which look a little like air purifiers. The higher end model, the AI M32, is a dual-band mesh system promising speeds up to 3.2 Gbps. Below that, D-Link is introducing the DIR-LX1870, which should offer combined connection speeds of around 1,800Mbps. The AI M32 will sell for $250 starting in the third quarter of 2021; the DIR-LX1870 launches right away for $130.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjzckZ"&gt;There are plenty of routers being announced this week as part of CES 2021. This year’s big new upgrade is routers with support for Wi-Fi 6E, a huge upgrade to Wi-Fi that quadruples the available airwaves on which they can broadcast. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22213115/tp-link-wifi-6e-first-routers-mesh-smart-speaker"&gt;TP-Link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21967423"&gt;Netgear&lt;/a&gt; have announced high-end routers with support for the new tech.&lt;/p&gt;
