    <title>In her Theranos fraud case, Elizabeth Holmes is speaking for herself</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From birth to the year 2006 in her first day of testimony&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N6tUok"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, her hair down and her makeup muted relative to her Theranos days, spelled her name for the court. After the prosecution rested its case in the morning, the defense called her as their third witness, about an hour before the end of the day. She wore a navy blazer with a white blouse — not one of the famous black turtlenecks has made an appearance in court during the months the case against her has dragged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ertv5"&gt;Holmes is facing 11 counts of wire fraud from her time as founder and CEO of Theranos. Though her testimony today is the first time she’s spoken for herself, we’ve heard her voice already — in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;recordings of &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; journalist Roger Parloff&lt;/a&gt;. In those recordings, she lies confidently about her device’s capabilities. And the lies Parloff recorded were consistent with the lies her investors testified that she told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRxqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TPBiGt"&gt;I do not think I am the only person who’s wondered how she’ll explain this. Now, we are going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QrX0n"&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much — we’ve learned about her education, the time she spent at Stanford, and that she dropped out to form Theranos. When her testimony ended today, we were still in 2006, well before the period the government alleges any fraud took place, which means most of the juicy stuff will have to wait until next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqw2jN"&gt;Holmes was cheerful, smiling at her attorney, Kevin Downey. She seemed relaxed and focused. Everyone I know has &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/why-did-elizabeth-holmes-use-a-fake-deep-voice.html"&gt;asked me about her voice&lt;/a&gt;. For what it’s worth, the most obnoxious part of The Voice Discourse is that most of these writers have no musical training. She is not and could never have been “baritone,” &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Inc&lt;/em&gt; wrote &lt;/a&gt;— she’s not even a tenor! — and the idea that she’d go up “&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryweissman/2019/03/29/elizabeth-holmes-baritone/?sh=2e68ef644b8b"&gt;several octaves&lt;/a&gt;” when she speaks normally, as John Carreyrou writes in &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a “real” pitch higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/VIDEO-Kristin-Chenoweth-Discusses-Her-Distinctive-Voice-on-CONAN-20180829"&gt;speaking voice of Kristen Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt;. That is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkwwWO"&gt;Holmes sounds like a normal alto to me, though she has a habit of dropping her voice to punch words she wants to emphasize. Then, she sounds like she has a cold, or perhaps, &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/elizabeth-holmess-fake-voice-is-actually-just-stupid-ma-1833402366"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;put it, like she’s using her “impression of a stupid man” voice. If it’s an affectation, it’s one she’s had so long that it’s natural to her now. In any event, most of her speech isn’t at the bottom of her range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ifiuqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The voice is part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzN3yX"&gt;But the voice is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/a&gt;, which I expect we will be hearing more about in the coming days. The defense has indicated that they expect to continue questioning her all next week; if the prosecution’s cross-exam is shorter than two days, I will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp6ymp"&gt;The story Holmes told in her testimony is well-known. She dropped out of Stanford and used the rest of the money her parents had saved from her college education, as well as some debt and some money from family friends, to found a company called Real-Time Cures. She later changed the name to Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDM9yU"&gt;Originally, the idea was to create a pill or patch, one that would analyze a person’s blood, allowing for more-precise medication dosing. But people seemed more interested in a tabletop device for blood analysis, rather than a pill or patch, so she switched her focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lULKt4"&gt;She raised money from Don Lucas, an investor best known for his association with Oracle, and Larry Ellison, among others. Lucas wanted to speak to some of the pharmaceutical companies Theranos had been working with as part of his due diligence, so we were shown a 2005 email where Holmes introduced Lucas to someone she’d been working with at Pfizer. We also saw the reply: that he’d be happy to talk to Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="196Kng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We nailed this one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69qe1M"&gt;With the money Holmes raised, she created a device called Theranos 1.0, a photo of which was displayed for the courtroom, and which to me looked like someone had attached a thick antenna to a gray printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjTm5m"&gt;During that time, the business plan was to work with drug companies on their clinical trials. She spoke to Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Bristol Myers Squibb. Theranos signed agreements with GSK in September 2006, and with Pfizer in November 2006. The company also did demos for Novartis and Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhiCXK"&gt;We were even shown an email from Holmes to the entire staff at Theranos about the Novartis demo. In the November 19, 2006 email, she wrote, “We nailed this one. You all did an incredible job in making this happen — this is the Theranos way. We are on a roll to do what we need to do next month and in ‘07.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PcfOs"&gt;We also saw a 2006 email from Holmes to Bob Grady, a partner at the Carlyle Group, when Holmes was raising money. In it, she lists people at Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis he can talk to if he wants to confirm their work with Theranos. Not all investors asked for this information, she testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="UZtLhS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSim4Q"&gt;And then we broke for the day. The period in which the government alleges fraud took place is still ahead of us. We know from&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt; the opening statements&lt;/a&gt; Holmes may blame Sunny Balwani, her co-defendant who is being tried separately; the defense suggested that her mistake was trusting him too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSyJDJ"&gt;She may also allege that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;he abused her&lt;/a&gt;. In court filings unsealed in August, she alleged that he controlled what she ate, how she dressed, and all her communications. (Balwani denies this.) The abuse allegations explain why the two are being tried separately; an expert on abusive relationships, Mindy Mechanic, is on the defense’s witness  list, though she may not be called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SxYdE"&gt;In her coming testimony, which I expect to be lengthy, I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to — that Theranos devices were used in Afghanistan and on military helicopters, that Theranos devices could perform more than 200 tests, and that the company did not use competitors’ machines for tests. I am particularly interested in the coming cross-examination, when the government can use her extensive body of statements, including those in the press, to ask her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="clUIXx"&gt;But right now, we’ve just heard the story of a fledgling startup — one that would not be interesting or unusual if it were not for how the company ended.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In a surprise move, Elizabeth Holmes is testifying at the Theranos fraud trial </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood-testing company Theranos, took the stand in her own defense late Friday, in a surprise move by the defense team. Holmes is being tried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, for allegedly misleading investors and patients about Theranos’ blood testing device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLQMHD"&gt;Holmes took the stand just after 6PM ET on Friday, to the surprise of most in the courtroom. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Liz Lopatto, who has been covering the trial, said Holmes seemed relaxed as she answered questions about her background and the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="phLMq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;holmes has been smiling a lot on the stand. she seems relaxed. a lot of you have been asking me about her voice. it doesn’t sound that low to me? but when she punches a syllable for emphasis, she drops her pitch.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1461838422113325060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACO7WA"&gt;Theranos was once valued at around $9 billion before investigative reporter John Carreyrou wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;expose for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that said the company wasn’t using its own device for the blood tests it was conducting, and company employees were concerned the device wasn’t accurate. After more &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports showed that the company’s tests were faulty and it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;voided two years of results&lt;/a&gt; from its Edison blood-testing device, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohr0Kv"&gt;The government rested its case on Friday morning, after several weeks, during which dozens of witnesses testified about Holmes and the work Theranos did. Her defense team is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646130/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;expected to argue that Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani,&lt;/a&gt; Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and business partner at Theranos, was abusive toward her and “that any success she achieved was because of him.” Balwani is being tried separately next year. &lt;/p&gt;

Despite its age, we still think it’s a great little smart speaker for the price, with decent sound and plenty of functionality thanks to Amazon’s Alexa. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

The Echo Frames are a lightweight pair of glasses outfitted with built-in small speakers and mics, which make it possible to listen to music and use Alexa on the go.

    <title>Google seeks recusal probe for incoming antitrust chief over Yelp and Microsoft cases</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YI7kXl"&gt;Google sent a letter to the Department of Justice Friday requesting that the department examine whether newly confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;antitrust division head Jonathan Kanter&lt;/a&gt;, who has been a vocal critic of the search giant, should be recused from federal antitrust investigations into Google. In his new role, Kanter will lead the department’s lawsuit against Google alleging it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;a monopoly in the search and advertising markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaicTK"&gt;Kanter has represented a number of companies in motions against Google, which the search giant argues should disqualify him. Most notably, Kanter represented Microsoft in a motion arguing against Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, which was eventually approved by regulators and was closed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UPmdo"&gt;“Mr. Kanter’s past statements and work representing competitors who have advocated for the cases brought by the Department raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. You can read Google’s full letter to the DOJ at the bottom of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haoTal"&gt;Kanter is the latest in a string of prominent antitrust appointments from the Biden administration, which also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Lina Khan’s confirmation&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the Federal Trade Commission and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;Tim Wu’s role&lt;/a&gt; working on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576926/facebook-seeks-ftc-chair-lina-khan-refusal-antitrust-case"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; sought to force Lina Khan to recuse herself from their cases on similar grounds, although, so far, the efforts have had little result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu with Live TV is raising its price to $70 but will include the Disney Bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ7N9gJcn19GhCLnNhCVFdNM5Bo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168419/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tO2ysq"&gt;Hulu with Live TV is getting another price hike, but the subscription will now include Disney Plus and ESPN Plus at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHwvay"&gt;Beginning December 21st, Hulu with Live TV’s monthly subscription cost will jump from its current price of $65 per month to $70 per month for its ad-supported tier. Its ad-free live TV package, meanwhile, will jump from $71 per month to $76 per month when the change goes into effect. The new pricing will apply to both new subscribers and those already paying for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMkPso"&gt;With the change, both of Hulu’s live TV packages will include ESPN Plus as well as Disney Plus, which cost $7 and $8 per month, respectively. That’s a major benefit to anyone currently paying for one or either of those services in addition to their Hulu with Live TV package. It’s less so, however, for subscribers &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; interested in Hulu with Live TV. The service last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price hike&lt;/a&gt; around this same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZaIU"&gt;Currently, that makes Hulu the most expensive among similarly priced live TV streaming services like YouTube TV and Fubo TV — both of which start at around $65 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ISMvS"&gt;Hulu’s primary streaming service sans live TV just got a price hike as well last month. The streaming service, which hosts Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362271/disney-20th-century-fox-television-tv-studio-name-rebrand"&gt;20th Television&lt;/a&gt; catalog, as well as other more adult-leaning content, now costs $7 per month (ad-supported) or $13 per month (no-ads).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just provided the perfect example of why you can’t trust App Store review scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFx2DPvClVc8nhdFNYoS9B53oYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168316/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61EF7S"&gt;You pissed off people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;by somewhat breaking your app&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re leaving angry reviews. How can you salvage your reputation? Apple just found one incredibly effective way — get listeners to submit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; reviews by interrupting their podcast experience with an in-app prompt to submit a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O5ANy"&gt;That’s how the Apple Podcasts app went from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;publicly embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; 1.8-star score all the way to 4.6 stars in a little over a month without any actual fixes, as developer and App Store watchdog Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s still going up: according to &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures data&lt;/a&gt;, the app has been getting thousands of ratings every day since November 9th, with the vast, overwhelming majority of them issuing a 5-star score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKI5P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How did “Apple Podcasts” suddenly go from 1.8 to 4.6 stars? Is Apple manipulating their own app ratings now? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ"&gt;https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5kJKYd54VP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5kJKYd54VP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLSaop"&gt;The app has made it to 4.7 stars overall as of this writing and is firmly the No. 1 App Store search result for “podcast.” It looks far more desirable to a new user than it might have before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJ4l36w1J8cs4Ok4ZBg5j-ulUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028458/app_figures2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppFigures estimates 6,292 five-star ratings were submitted on November 17th alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqFVI"&gt;If you think there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, you might be right — it could definitely be that people who bother to submit reviews tend to be angry, and a lot of people who love Apple Podcasts and never bothered to look it up in the App Store (remember, it’s preinstalled!) are finally balancing things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRKH5"&gt;But do those people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; love Apple Podcasts? Because if you really look at the reviews, it seems like some funny business is going on. There are new, positive reviews, but they aren’t reviews of the Apple Podcasts app at all — they’re reviews of podcasts themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omaoOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5AtQE"&gt;I kid you not — this is the top review for Apple Podcasts on the App Store: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gjlDWMerX2-r8gik_iK5ynV0kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028402/apple_podcasts_review.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple deems this the “Most Helpful” review of its Podcasts app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mp9WiE"&gt;Here are a few more of the “Most Recent” reviews of the Apple Podcasts app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mG2cO"&gt;“Amazing show! Hilarious and well researched,” writes SammyAls, adding, “The dynamic is amazing, and the content is SO needed! Love this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjOpm8"&gt;“Mobley has Depth and Insight,” writes xbacksideslider. “Nice to listen to thoughtful and factual podcast. Far from the superficial emotional appeals to envy and self congratulating faux empathy that so dominate popular culture.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gtRf9"&gt;“The table,” says Jkimble6091. “Being a future young millionaire listening to Anthony Oneal keeps me on track during all the ups and downs of life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdJELO"&gt;I wondered if maybe this was a common confusion with podcast apps, where listeners think they’re reviewing a podcast instead of the app itself. But no, I didn’t see that obvious pattern when I checked reviews for other top podcast apps in the App Store. Almost every review on competing apps was a review of the apps themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="095B9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pSFJU"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s using a new prompt but claims it’s nothing out of the ordinary. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” wrote an Apple spokesperson who agreed to comment if they were not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJppJu"&gt;We weren’t able to track down a copy of the prompt ourselves to confirm when and where it appears or what it looks like — which seems important if people are getting confused — but it is indeed &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/"&gt;a standard feature of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, one you can even turn off if you like under Settings &amp;gt; App Store &amp;gt; In-App Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lQcf"&gt;But intentional or not, standard or not, the problem with star scores is there’s no way to tell whether they’re legitimate. We don’t know if someone pressed a five-star button because they loved the app, or thought they were rating the podcast itself, or just wanted to close the prompt as quickly as possible. We don’t know if Apple is prompting everyone, or just its most dedicated fans, or some other algorithmic subset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;just happened to give it an advantage&lt;/a&gt;. Some bad actors reportedly even buy star scores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;their egregious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s impossible for most App Store shoppers to tell. We’ve even seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;an iOS app that refuses to open unless you give it a good score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3UShJ"&gt;These are the reasons why I suggested that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;should lead the industry by killing off star ratings for good&lt;/a&gt;, among other things it could do to prove it puts people ahead of profits in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM5ZQS"&gt;But with Apple Podcasts, the company is using the same broken star score system that uplifts scammers for its own benefit as well. And it’s a crystal clear example of why you can’t trust star scores — because everyone knows this was a 1.8-star app just last month &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;with many valid lingering complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing’s fundamentally changed. It’s the exact same app today as it was then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look into how Amazon failed to secure customer personal data </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bAVrqxS-Sy9De24OzBAkHyvVyrA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168309/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fn2M8A"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes a shocking lack of concern for customer data at e-commerce giant Amazon, where employees took advantage of the faulty system to look up celebrities’ purchases, among other breaches. It seems that despite Amazon’s professed customer-first mentality, company officials failed to prioritize securing its customers’ most personal information. Customer purchase histories were available to Amazon’s global customer service team, with little security or supervision to prevent the employees’ snooping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lEb6eC"&gt;One former service rep, who requested anonymity, said he remembered colleagues looking up the purchases of Kanye West and movie stars from the Avengers films, even scoping out a few dildos in a particular celebrity’s purchase log. Other staffers recalled coworkers looking up exes and girlfriends or boyfriends. “Everybody, everybody did it,” a former customer service manager says. They weren’t supposed to, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jumUo5"&gt;Eventually, accusations of employees &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;viewing seller data&lt;/a&gt; to develop Amazon’s own products prompted questions about the company’s integrity. During an antitrust hearing in 2020, former Amazon CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Jeff Bezos insisted &lt;/a&gt;that employees don’t access that data but said he couldn’t guarantee that the policy prohibiting employees from doing so wasn’t violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNjFiQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; is a deep dive that demonstrates how your data can be at risk if a massive company mismanages internal access to it or carelessly leaves it open to outsiders. Though &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-trust-amazon-and-google-more-than-the-police-or-the-government-2020-01-14"&gt;Amazon is often ranked&lt;/a&gt; one of the most trusted companies in the world, this &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;story calls into question whether it’s worthy of that trust from its customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NZXT introduces $800 gaming PC with no dedicated GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXQwGSYrszaW5o9-tUWfzqVE3wE=/107x0:1238x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168126/1636592366_foundation_h510_whatsanapu_primary.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="07MzFQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fnews%2Fintroducing-the-nzxt-bld-foundation-pc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT has introduced&lt;/a&gt; an interesting pre-built PC for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;the age of the graphics card shortage&lt;/a&gt; — one that’s powered by a Ryzen 5600G, a CPU with a built-in GPU that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KycNI1FxIPc"&gt;can reasonably be used for gaming&lt;/a&gt;. While, in normal circumstances, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Ffoundation-pc-h510-edition&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT’s $800 Foundation PC&lt;/a&gt; might not be the first pick for those looking to get into PC gaming, the low availability and inflated prices of dedicated GPUs (and machines that include them) make it an interesting option for budget-minded buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An2ch2"&gt;The AMD processor / graphics card combo is the centerpiece of the build, but its other specs are also respectable: it comes with a 500GB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM. And while its 650W Bronze power supply won’t be winning any efficiency awards, it should be able to power something like an RTX 3060 if you’re able to get your hands on one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cws7-PI5Kf_72fTJ2wocAFaaM30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028365/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_12.58.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NZXT says the machine should get reasonable frame rates at 1080p medium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nx3fwc"&gt;Of course, having a dedicated GPU would be preferable for almost any gaming scenario, which is why most vendors include one — even the GTX 1650 included with the lowest-end HP Omen can outperform the 5600G’s graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iWNbo"&gt;If you’re shopping for one of those models, though, you’ll likely have competition — they can be a gold mine for scalpers, who will sometimes “shuck” a valuable GPU from a pre-built and sell the card and now-GPU-less PC separately (the $900 Omen’s Nvidia 1650 could sell for upwards of $300 by itself on eBay). You don’t have to search for gaming PCs on eBay for very long before you run into listings for pre-builts with “NO GPU” or “without graphics card” in the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIvhsk"&gt;If you’re adventurous and know what to look for, you could potentially find a decent deal by buying one of those scalper leftovers. While the integrated graphics on modern Intel CPUs don’t match the power of the 5600G, they will let you at least use your computer until you can find a GPU. I was able to find at least a few shucked computers in the $500 to $600 range that would likely perform better than the Foundation once both were equipped with a dedicated GPU. Whether you want to support someone who likely scalped a GPU or not is really up to you — though if you do go this route, do keep in mind that the only desktop Ryzen CPUs that can be used without a dedicated graphics card &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-with-graphics"&gt;are actually APUs that have a G&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the model name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cNaBiI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Foundation’s selling point may be that you can actually buy it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XLX1G"&gt;Since you can’t separate the 5600G’s graphics card and sell it for a markup, the Foundation may not be as enticing to scalpers, potentially preventing it from winding up constantly out-of-stock like many of NZXT’s other pre-builts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKwKPN_HrD-EcdmOpshf89BcVVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028398/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_13.06.43.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The state of NZXT’s other PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4poZ"&gt;Some manufacturers can at least mitigate concerns of scalpers snapping up their pre-builts by giving base models low-end GPUs that aren’t particularly desirable — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2FStore%2FAMD-Ryzen-3rd-Gen-Starter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iBuyPower’s AMD Ryzen 3rd Gen Starter PC&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, comes stock with a Ryzen 3600 and an Nvidia GTX 1030 (which &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-5600g-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; is a tad slower than the 5600G’s integrated graphics for most games). But that configuration is almost $300 more than the NZXT, and the CPU is going to be slower — iBuyPower will let you upgrade to a 5600G, but then your 1030 would be next to useless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98P1mL"&gt;If the 5600G’s relative uselessness to scalpers helps NZXT keep the Foundation in stock, it could be a good choice for those who don’t want to build their own PCs but who would be comfortable slotting in a graphics card at some point in the future when they’re more readily attainable again. Hopefully, it could inspire other vendors, too — while some will currently let you equip the 5600G alongside an external graphics card, that configuration likely won’t be worth fighting scalpers for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Smart Thermostat review: a $60 stunner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The budget thermostat Nest should have made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pKc8wM"&gt;Since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched in 2011, no other smart thermostat has emulated its core function — learning your schedule and adapting to it automatically, so you don’t have to lift a finger. This feature has made the Nest one of the best smart thermostats (lots of) money can buy for years. But just a decade on, Amazon has finally done it. The online shopping giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 Amazon Smart Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; can intelligently determine if you’re home, away, or sleeping and automatically adjust your climate to keep you comfortable and potentially save you money. And you don’t have to program anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px6wKx"&gt;Amazon worked with Resideo (owner of the historic thermostat brand Honeywell Home) to develop the thermostat, and its internals are very similar to the Honeywell T9 and T5 smart thermostats. It’s compatible with most 24 volt HVAC systems (you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=smart+thermostat&amp;amp;qid=1637326592&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check compatibility here&lt;/a&gt;), but doesn’t support systems with more than three stages or multi-speed fans. Together, Amazon and Resideo seem to have finally cracked the smart thermostat conundrum, and the Amazon Smart Thermostat’s learning feature — called Hunches — is very good. No, it isn’t quite as good as Nest’s, but it also doesn’t cost $250. So, tradeoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nue7FD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10875005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtN1I8"&gt;Hunches — which are part of Amazon’s broader Alexa smart home platform — are AI-driven decisions that use data from your Alexa smart home to decide what to do with your temperature. It follows, unsurprisingly, that the more Echo smart speakers and displays you have in your home, the better it will be. According to Amazon, Hunches also uses “select other smart home devices like lights, locks, and sensors” to determine if you are home or away, as well as geolocation of yours and your household members’ smartphones (everyone has to have the Alexa app installed and location settings turned on for the thermostat). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0YTyB"&gt;However, unlike with the similar Nest experience, you don’t have control over which devices make those decisions; you don’t even know which ones make the decisions. This led to some confusion in my testing, including that Alexa now thinks I get up at 4:31AM every morning, I assume because my daughter sat up in bed at that time and has an Echo Show as her bedside clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSQjnr"&gt;For the next three days, it turned on the heat a little too early, and I had to go into the thermostat settings in the app to tell Alexa its Hunch was wrong. After three times telling it that, no, we do not wake up at 4:31AM, it reverted to our regular wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sjS4Nicw4w-eSg0vp726Jxi29U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019741/jtuohy_211116_4885_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The controls on the Smart Thermostat are three touch points on the bottom. LED icons show you the ambient temperature by default, then the current set point when you tap on one of the arrows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Foqcf2"&gt;It’s hard to quibble much at this price, however, because at least it’s trying to be smart. Outside of Nest and Ecobee, few thermostats are actually smart. Most are just controlled remotely — either by an app, voice, or geolocation (where it adjusts based on whether your smartphone is at home). This is all very handy, but it’s not intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3oHVU"&gt;Case in point, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; has no advanced AI features of which to speak. While it can do useful energy-saving or comfort-increasing tasks such as preheat or cool the home or use the fan to circulate air to more efficiently use air conditioning, it doesn’t have any learning features and its smarts are reliant on Google’s geofenced home / away modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNGDdE"&gt;If you don’t like the idea of Amazon controlling your climate willy-nilly, the Smart Thermostat has a standard scheduling option. With either set up, you can also use Alexa’s Routines to have your thermostat do specific things based on time of day, when a smart home device tells it to (such as a compatible temperature or motion sensor), or with your voice. These functions are available to any smart thermostat that works with Alexa, but you will not find one as inexpensive as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlv1hKJQNQukGCEHtt0PV4lZhfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019731/jtuohy_211115_4885_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Smart Thermostat is a simple white box that snaps on to a base, which you wire into your existing thermostat wiring. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SijpUPNp6MoMfHuKB0q4MtdXKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019733/jtuohy_211115_4885_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It comes with a faceplate to help cover up any holes in the wall from removing your existing thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Thnrgy"&gt;The closest competitor price-wise — the Wyze Smart Thermostat — is $80, and the Honeywell T5 and T9, whose hardware the Amazon thermostat shares, start at $120. Most other smart thermostats are over $100, including the Emerson Sensi, the Lux Kono, and then Ecobee’s and Nest’s start at $180 and $130, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyte3e"&gt;Of course, almost all those thermostats work with multiple platforms. The Amazon thermostat only works with Alexa. And while the coming smart home standard Matter — which promises interoperability between ecosystems — may change that, Amazon has not confirmed that this device will be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdjFQN"&gt;While this thermostat is inexpensive, it doesn’t look cheap, unlike the Wyze Smart Thermostat, which has a plasticky feel and an odd, oblong design. The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes, and because it doesn’t have an LCD screen, it doesn’t scream “high tech” like others in this space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqU6Qi"&gt;Instead, the all-white plastic body has a capacitive touch surface that illuminates LEDs to show you the touch points, system mode, and set temperature. There is also a small green tree that appears when you set the temperature to ones Amazon thinks are energy-saving — 68 degrees or below for heating and 75 degrees or above for cooling in my location. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I have to wonder how Nest and its iconic green leaf feels about this. At least Amazon didn’t copy Nest and make you pay an extra $15 for a faceplate to cover up any wall warts left after installation; you get one included (and a screwdriver!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3fzd1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FXYN"&gt;Despite the minimalist look, there are enough controls on the device for easy, everyday use — you can switch modes from heat, cool, fan, and auto, as well as adjust the temperature up and down and turn the system off. Only the bottom of the device is touch-capacitive, and there are three small markers to show where to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UZsYt"&gt;Most of the setup and programming of the thermostat requires the Alexa app. And, as you’d expect from an Amazon device, it’s designed to be controlled with your voice. This makes it surprising that the Alexa voice assistant isn’t built in as it is in some of Ecobee’s models. Instead, you need to have a compatible Alexa device for voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LtOPvE80jG3jALjBcjIwElY4QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019735/jtuohy_211115_4885_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical installation of the Smart Thermostat is identical to that of Honeywell’s T9 or T5 and requires shutting off the power and wiring the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a7ZgMx"&gt;Integration with Alexa is straightforward and doesn't require a skill or account linking. Setup and installation of the thermostat is similarly simple. You will want to check if your heating and / or cooling system is compatible first, however. And if you don’t have a C-wire, you will need to opt for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5M7ZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 version&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a C-wire adapter and plan for a much more involved installation. (C-wire is short for common wire and supplies power to your thermostat. Most connected thermostats need a C-wire to connect to Wi-Fi, which is a big power drain.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6RpV8lPgtXL48kpW7TuL71apy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027512/1C240497_D38F_4D22_8F07_0B21AC3D1CD5.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alexa app offers a good interface for controlling the thermostat, it just takes a bit of digging to find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pE2PA"&gt;Everything you need to install the thermostat comes in the box, including a screwdriver and handy labels for identifying the thermostat wires. The Alexa app guided me through installation very well, making it clear which wires should go where, connecting the thermostat to my Wi-Fi, and testing that everything was working correctly. If you are uncomfortable with wiring or aren’t familiar with how your heating and cooling system works, you should get professional help. Messing up your HVAC system will be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Dxb8"&gt;Using the Alexa Smart Thermostat was a smooth experience. The Hunches worked well (other than my 4:30AM blip), turning my heating down between 11PM and 11:30PM every night and back on at 6AM in the morning. Switching to away when the house was empty during the day was less reliable, and in my week of testing, I wasn’t able to get a firm read on how long it takes to adjust to an empty home — this is a key component of any energy savings this device will get you, so I’ll update this review once I’ve had more time to evaluate the feature. However, you do have the option of telling Alexa, by saying “Alexa, I’m leaving” as you walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYZXdZ"&gt;Controlling the thermostat with voice using an Echo speaker or display was smooth — and with the latter, an interactive screen pops up for further control if needed. You can control the mode with voice, too, switching to heating or cooling, and even ask Alexa to change the temperature when no one is home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="rvCPbP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875137"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3BRL4z"&gt;But the app was a more frustrating experience. It takes four or five taps to get into the thermostat screen, although eventually I was able to add the thermostat to the new Favorites section in Alexa’s devices page, which speeds things up a tad. Once on the correct screen, the controls mimic those of the physical device, plus there’s a humidity reading (the thermostat has a humidity sensor in it, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor for adjusting the brightness of the LEDs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUMrsx"&gt;The one other area I ran into issues with was using the thermostat in a two-zoned home. As with all thermostats, you need one for each zone in a multi-zoned system&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and they control the climate independently.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Alexa app wouldn’t let me set the home, away, and sleep temperatures separately; whatever I set for my upstairs zone also applied to my downstairs zone. That’s not ideal if you like to sleep at 66 degrees but want your living room and kitchen to drop to 62 at night to save energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4crZWU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multi-zone support needs some work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzlNni"&gt;Switching the upstairs thermostat to a schedule and keeping the downstairs on Hunches did allow me to have different set points, but that’s not an ideal solution. This is a problem in the Alexa software, as with every other thermostat I have tested in this two-zone system, each thermostat controls each zone entirely independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w93VPY"&gt;The other drawback is that there are no temperature sensors designed specifically for the Alexa Smart Thermostat. It’s possible to set Alexa Routines to use with the temperature sensors built into some Echo speakers or with compatible third-party motion or temperature sensors like those from Centralite and Aqara, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761003/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Air Quality Monitor will work with Routines&lt;/a&gt;. But that integration isn’t as seamless or as easy to use as thermostats with native temperature sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nfsg2D968iwUDAINfSfwodY0a-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019737/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While there are basic controls on the device, the Alexa app on a compatible smartphone is required to set up and control the thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EpowwF"&gt;The Nest Learning Thermostat, the Ecobee thermostats, and the Honeywell T9 Thermostat all work very well with their own external sensors, but these thermostats cost $100 to $150 more than Amazon’s. You also don’t get useful extra features such as the time and weather displayed on this cheaper thermostat or integration with platforms or voice assistants other than Alexa. Still, if those features aren’t important to you, then you really can’t go wrong with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ohct2i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to not be impressed with this thermostat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aVJNM3"&gt;Based on my testing, it’s hard not to be impressed with the Amazon Smart Thermostat, and not just because it’s cheap. I have tested almost every smart thermostat released since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched a decade ago, and this is easily one of the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lh8bxj"&gt;I would still choose a Nest Learning Thermostat for my home because I love the look and feel of it, and I have more control over how it manages my home’s climate (plus it works with both Google and Alexa). However, I thoroughly recommend the Amazon Smart Thermostat over the new Google Nest Thermostat, which is a dumbed-down version of the original (something of a theme with Nest devices these days). Honestly, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is the budget thermostat Google Nest should have made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hedge fund billionaire outbid crypto investors for a rare copy of the US Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The 2016 SALT Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZoFYUcEX4FkPaTRf1ju3Jwr_bY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167731/530884400.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SPRi4"&gt;It turns out the way to beat the collective will of the internet’s cryptocurrency fans is to have way, way more money than them. Ken Griffin, the CEO and founder of Citadel, has revealed himself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;the winner of last night’s $43.2 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a rare copy of the US Constitution. A collective of crypto enthusiasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;calling themselves ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, managed to raise $47 million in about a week’s time in a quixotic attempt to win the document themselves and put it on display to the public for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DajNmR"&gt;While the DAO didn’t win, they did manage to push the price up on Griffin, with the two parties slowly going back and forth million by million during the auction last night, each seemingly uncertain if they would be able to go a million higher with every passing bid. Finally, ConstitutionDAO threw in the towel, telling supporters they wouldn’t have had enough remaining money to “insure, store, and transport the document.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SUkRS9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuqpNW"&gt;Griffin seems to be aware that a collective of 17,000 people will be pretty unhappy with him, so, perhaps not-so-coincidentally, he’s committing to roughly the same goals that they laid out for the document had they won the auction. “I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces,” he said in a statement. That’ll start with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, which has free admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttJu7v"&gt;Citadel is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2021/10/05/richest-hedge-fund-managers-forbes-400-list-2021/?sh=21da81e0eea4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; ranks him&lt;/a&gt; fourth on their list of wealthiest hedge fund managers, with a net worth of $16.1 billion. His win at the auction may only further frustrate the internet-first finance crowd, some of whom are skeptical of Griffin’s other company, Citadel Securities, because it pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trading orders. Just this week, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit"&gt;dismissed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Robinhood and Citadel Securities colluded to freeze trading during the GameStonk explosion in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BNnQO"&gt;After losing the bid, ConstitutionDAO is essentially dissolving and plans to return all funds raised to contributors, minus transaction fees. The group’s organizers say “this wasn’t the outcome we hoped for,” but they were “still in shock that we even got this far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QeLeM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 19th, 6:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Griffin is the majority owner of both Citadel and Citadel Securities, but the two companies operate independently, according to a Citadel Securities spokesperson. This story originally stated Citadel Securities was a subsidiary of Citadel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
