    <title>Google TV will include a new ‘Basic’ mode to make your smart TV, dumb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2CfT0j0IieqRz025OECpSsgGx7w=/0x0:1423x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872240/google_tv_basic_mode.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The basic TV option reportedly appears at setup. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/" target="_blank"&gt;Google / 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iG3HrV"&gt;Google TV, the search giant’s latest attempt at TV software, will include a new “Basic TV” mode that strips out a TV’s smart features in favor of providing simple access to live TV and HDMI inputs, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a potential boon to anyone that ever wanted to dumb-down their smart TV because they prefer an external streamer or because they value privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4jmCU"&gt;Google TV debuted on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;the new Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, where it offered a new interface built on Google’s existing Android TV software, but will soon be offered as built-in software for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/11/tcl-google-tv-2021/"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;Sony’s&lt;/a&gt; upcoming TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woVj7j"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you can select the “Basic TV” mode at setup. Doing so strips out the operating system’s apps, content recommendations, and Google Assistant support. It’s possible to revert back to the standard interface at any time, but selecting the basic mode can only be done on setup. Unfortunately it’s unclear exactly what the interface will end up looking like, since the developer-focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004376/google-adt-3-android-tv-10-update-set-top-hdmi-2-1"&gt;ADT-3 dongle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; tested the mode on doesn’t have the required live TV or HDMI hardware. We also don’t know how basic mode will affect data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OU_exYd-Lzk6bfj4NbGuxl15V-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327792/google_tv_basic_mode_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/" target="_blank"&gt;Google / 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interface shows which features the basic TV mode strips out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zEk7gn"&gt;A Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;that the mode is a feature of Google TV specifically, rather than Android TV 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tTXi7"&gt;There are plenty of reasons that people might want to remove all the smarts from a smart TV. Many users rely on set-top boxes from Apple, Roku, or Amazon for their streaming content, and a duplicate interface built into their TV just gets in the way. Others might want to continue using a TV long after developers have stopped supporting its software and apps, at which point it’s helpful to be able to strip it down to its bare essentials to improve performance. Or maybe you just don’t like the idea of using a smart TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14527360/vizio-smart-tv-tracking-settlement-disable-settings"&gt;given their history of tracking you everything you watch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overcast overhauls its Apple Watch app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXtyWAMsl4ChX8JMzdaDOXkvstQ=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872032/IMG_1337_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXVs25"&gt;A new update to popular podcast player &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm"&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt; includes a major overhaul of its Apple Watch app. The Apple Watch support is notable at a time when third-party app development for the platform is not necessarily in a great spot, though the Watch itself continues to grow in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EWM1X"&gt;Overcast’s update reorganizes the app UI from top to bottom, adding some features that otherwise were only able to be accessed through the phone version. The main screen has large buttons for settings and syncing above a scrolling list of your shows and access to the “now playing” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoXK26"&gt;That screen now includes a button on the bottom right that takes you to more detailed info on the podcast and lets you adjust its playback speed, as well as giving you the ability to skip directly through chapters on podcasts that have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPtCUOTDx-UFlGAdUDAdrx6Ul8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327758/overcast.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ArC1lb"&gt;Release notes for the new iOS version of Overcast, which is dubbed 2021.1, note a couple of extra changes without going into details. Other than the new Watch app, Overcast now has “improved Siri support” and “tons of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddXyoR"&gt;Overcast is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857"&gt;available for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now M1-powered Macs because of their support for running iOS apps. The app is free but ad-supported, with an optional $9.99 subscription that can remove the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FdkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australia passes law requiring Facebook and Google to pay for news content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HvCa30KC5S6ZCff4Budq2ZEcHw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871551/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CL08Y9"&gt;The Australian government has passed a new law requiring Google and Facebook to negotiate with news outlets to pay for their content or face arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns6nQe"&gt;“This is a significant milestone,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg/status/1364713030710272000"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Josh Frydenberg, the Liberal party’s deputy leader who spearheaded the new law. “This legislation will help level the playing field &amp;amp; see Australian news media businesses paid for generating original content.” The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says the law &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/response-to-google-open-letter"&gt;will address&lt;/a&gt; “a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sI0dN0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new code has seen fierce opposition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jHIfyu"&gt;The new code has seen fierce opposition from the two tech giants. The most vocal of the two has been Facebook, which temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;blocked users and publishers from sharing news content&lt;/a&gt; on its main social network and only relented after the Australian government agreed to make a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;series of amendments &lt;/a&gt;to the proposed law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMXBZs"&gt;Google also suggested initially that it would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;pull its search engine&lt;/a&gt; from the country if the law came into force, but it later walked back its plans. Instead, Google chose to ink deals with media organizations to pay them for news content. These include a &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;major three-year agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. that will see Google make “significant payments” to host content from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Post &lt;/em&gt;in its News Showcase product. According &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/17/google-pay-news-corp/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these deals are intended to allow it to sidestep paying for stories linked to in regular search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qHKKd"&gt;The News Media Bargaining Code requires Facebook and Google to pay a negotiated fee to link to or use news content, and includes a mandatory arbitration process if an agreement on fees can’t be reached. It also asks tech companies to give advance notice to news organizations about upcoming algorithm changes. It’s the threat of arbitration that both Google and Facebook had hoped to avoid, a process whereby an independent body decides the value of news content in news feeds and search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ObSKJw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The law has the support of Microsoft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjQEGc"&gt;The law is currently designed to target Facebook and Google specifically, but in the future it could be &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Exposure%20Draft%20EM%20-%20NEWS%20MEDIA%20AND%20DIGITAL%20PLATFORMS%20MANDATORY%20BARGAINING%20CODE%20BILL%202020.pdf"&gt;expanded to other platforms&lt;/a&gt; “where fundamental bargaining power imbalances with Australian news businesses emerge.” However, &lt;a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/additional-amendments-news-media-and-digital"&gt;amendments to the law&lt;/a&gt; mean the government can also take into account any commercial agreements a tech company has made with news publishers before formally designating it as a platform under the code. The law is due to be reviewed a year after it comes into effect to assess its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tlfHI"&gt;Although Google has walked back its threat to pull its search engine from the country, the company is still &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/17/google-pay-news-corp/#fb-root:~:text=Despite%20making%20the%20publisher%20deals%2C%20Google,moved%20onto%20the%20Senate%20on%20Wednesday"&gt;opposed to the law&lt;/a&gt; because it’s against the idea of paying the websites its search engine links to. It has also expressed concerns about its arbitration process. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/unfair-arbitration/"&gt;blog post last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company argued that the specific form of arbitration being proposed (binding final-offer arbitration) is unpredictable, and is biased against Google because the arbitrator “isn’t required to consider the value Google provides to news media businesses in the form of traffic to their websites.” The arbitrator also considers news outlets’ production costs, but not Google’s, it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaJXoU"&gt;But the ACCC argues the law is necessary after its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/26/facebook-and-google-face-tighter-rules-in-australia-as-accc-releases-report"&gt;18-month inquiry found&lt;/a&gt; tech giants were taking a disproportionately large share of online advertising revenue, which it believes comes at the expense of media organizations. And that was before the pandemic hit Australia’s media industry hard, with over a hundred local newspapers across the country either laying off journalists, stopping printing, or shutting down completely last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/28/news-corp-announces-end-of-nearly-100-australian-print-newspapers-in-huge-shift-to-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ytegb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This new law is a big step forward. It helps ensure publishers and journalists get paid a fairer share for their work. Australia has shown what’s possible and other democracies around the world can build on their ideas. &lt;a href="https://t.co/je2J5CpIvY"&gt;https://t.co/je2J5CpIvY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brad Smith (@BradSmi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1364765328555835392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WS1wVZ"&gt;At least one tech company has come out strongly in support of the new law: Microsoft. The operator of the Bing search engine — which has less than 5 percent of the search engine market in Australia — &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/03/microsoft-supports-australian-government-proposal-addressing-news-media-and-digital-platforms/"&gt;publicly backed the law&lt;/a&gt;, saying it “reasonably attempts to address the bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and Australian news businesses” and that it would be willing to abide by the rules “if the government designates us.” It later &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/11/endorsement-australias-proposal-technology-news/"&gt;came out in support&lt;/a&gt; of regulators introducing similar laws in the EU and US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hc8lD"&gt;Regardless of whether other countries end up introducing similar laws, Australia’s news code has likely already had an impact outside its boarders. The deal struck between Google and publishers like News Corp cover publications all around the world, and the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2fed6b2a-01ba-4c7e-8e95-d50f74c316bf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the value of these deals has increased markedly as a result of Australia’s law. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s working to get ‘Hey Google’ working on Wear OS again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5jhy2JAhI3Ke5syq4F5gM47FLo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871181/vpavic_180927_2987_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeHoGE"&gt;Activating the Google Assistant by saying “Hey Google” has been broken for months, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/wear-os-hey-google-assistant-broken/"&gt;according to a report from 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;. Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s now working on a fix, saying that it’s “aware of the issues some users have been encountering” and will help its partners “address these and improve the overall experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVjWHn"&gt;There are a good number of users reporting the issue — a post &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/172776291"&gt;on Google’s Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt; has almost a thousand stars. Reading through the thread, it’s clear that many users with different smartwatch models are all reporting the same issue going back to November 2020. They say the assistant isn’t completely unusable, as users are still able to trigger it with a long button-press, but if the voice-activation feature hasn’t been working for that long, it likely doesn’t help the perception &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;that Google doesn’t care about Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsPAbp"&gt;Google’s statement doesn’t make it clear how long it’ll be until the issue is fixed, but hopefully it’s getting attention now. While Wear OS may not be core to Google’s strategy, the Assistant seems to be, and it’d be nice for people who have chosen to put Google’s OS on their wrists to have easy access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about a plane crash survivor who researches memory and trauma</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI2MSbPZQJLAQmhXvJFICoZcsu4=/0x112:2040x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871177/SUBNET_Final_1.0.1412976335.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/05/27a.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58DX8b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; has done &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remember-disaster-without-being-shattered-ptsd-covid/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;an amazing piece on Margaret McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher who survived a traumatic plane crash, then went on to become a leader in the field of memory and trauma. The article starts off with a harrowing recounting of the accident, but then goes on to explain her research around it, as she gathered other survivors from the crash to conduct a study on how people remember a disaster — one which she participated in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="isgr0z"&gt;And so it was that, in 2004, as a guinea pig in her own research, McKinnon found herself lying face-up inside of a magnetic resonance imaging machine, staring up at a mirror reflecting a projection of B-roll from &lt;em&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/em&gt;: A plane taking off from a runway. A map of the flight route. Clips from &lt;em&gt;Chocolat&lt;/em&gt; interspersed between plane animations. McKinnon’s own &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/2002-passenger-relives-air-transat-flight-236-318699075750"&gt;younger face&lt;/a&gt; flashed before her eyes too—her barely-there makeup, blue eyes, and bob haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nBf8Gl"&gt;The article gets into the mechanics of PTSD, many of which were revealed in part thanks to McKinnon’s research. It’s a topic that often gets talked about (though arguably still not enough), but &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; goes in deep to explain the difference between simply remembering and reliving. It also touches on the different ways people react to traumatic situations, and some of the underlying causes of those reactions — part of what inspired McKinnon’s work was the very different reactions she and her husband had during and after the crash, which happened just a few weeks before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Vlr1x"&gt;McKinnon is now turning her attention to the pandemic and its impact on frontline healthcare workers, in hopes that she will be able to help the ones that end up traumatized. The article is not only the story of a woman who, remarkably, turned a terrifying experience into a way to help others, but it helps shed light on an important mental health issue, that unfortunately may become more relevant as the long-term effects of the pandemic start to manifest. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remember-disaster-without-being-shattered-ptsd-covid/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;definitely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything to know about Paramount Plus, ViacomCBS’s new version of CBS All Access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9lO2sGnFNotUHUPH9mO-pjtHDk=/528x0:1920x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870758/paramount_plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80do4r"&gt;In just over a week, CBS All Access will become &lt;a href="https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/482924/1001331/3065?sharedid=VergeEverythingtoKnowAboutParamountPlus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a rebranded version of the streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;launching on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WM5WO3"&gt;Paramount Plus will use combined franchises and assets from Viacom and CBS (who remerged in 2019) to offer more than 20,000 episodes of television and films from a number of networks. These networks and studios include BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures. Every announcement made today can be read &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbs.com/files/2021/02/Paramount-Content-Addendum-2.24.21.pdf"&gt;on ViacomCBS’ site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iMsll"&gt;The streaming service will launch at two separate pricing tiers: an ad-supported version that includes full breadth of Paramount movies, Paramount Plus originals, a “massive portion of library,” according to streaming CEO Tom Ryan, and current seasons of CBS shows for $4.99. This is launching in June. The premium tier will have live sports supplemented with even more options, live CBS news feeds, and a live CBS TV experience for $9.99. The company will have more information about bundle options “soon,” according to Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWR2II"&gt;Customers on premium CBS All Access plans should just automatically roll into Paramount Plus. By the time the ad-supported version of Paramount Plus launches, the $5.99 CBS All Access plan will no longer be offered, but existing customers on that plan will be grandfathered into All Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oLn7EE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what does that get people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PCfoN"&gt;Let’s start with TV fans. Paramount Plus will carry a number of older popular shows, like &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;, as well as new originals based around popular franchises like &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Godfather. &lt;/em&gt;Nickelodeon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix"&gt;launching an Avatar Studios&lt;/a&gt; to make more TV series and films based on the world of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra. &lt;/em&gt;Nickelodeon fans, Paramount Plus is also working on a live-action Dora the Explorer series and a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paramountplus/status/1364718671034273796"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Fairly OddParents&lt;/em&gt; show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxuPVu"&gt;Some of the original series announced today include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299973/frasier-reboot-paramount-plus-streaming-kelsey-grammer"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;revival&lt;/a&gt; with Kelsey Grammer set to reprise his role as Dr. Frasier Crane, and several series based on popular Paramount movies, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299958/italian-job-sequel-series-flashdance-fatal-attracion-shows-paramount-plus-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italian Job, Flashdance, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;revival — and all 15 seasons of the original CBS crime procedural — will also stream exclusively on Paramount Plus. Finally, a reboot of &lt;em&gt;Inside Amy Schumer &lt;/em&gt;and a weekly spinoff of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show &lt;/em&gt;were also ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6MPZGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nickelodeon is &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix" target="_blank"&gt;launching an Avatar Studios&lt;/a&gt; to make more TV series and films based on the world of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGd9kj"&gt;These series join previously announced titles heading to Paramount Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Offer&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a limited series based on the making-of process behind &lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Lioness&lt;/em&gt;, a show about a young marine who is recruited to befriend a terrorist in order to bring down the organization; a reimagining of MTV’s &lt;em&gt;Behind The Music; &lt;/em&gt;a documentary series based on FBI profilers; a revival of BET’s &lt;em&gt;The Game; &lt;/em&gt;a new SpongeBob SquarePants series called &lt;em&gt;Kamp Koral; &lt;/em&gt;and a new version of &lt;em&gt;The Real World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPfXFa"&gt;Today’s event also brought with it a ton of movie news. CEO Bob Bakish noted that many Paramount films will go to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355563/mulan-disney-plus-streaming-exclusive-cost-own-movies-theaters"&gt;Paramount Plus 30 to 45 days&lt;/a&gt; after their theatrical release, with others appearing 90 days after their theatrical release. For example, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place 2 &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Paramount Plus just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;45 days after it’s released&lt;/a&gt; in theaters this September. &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Paw Patrol &lt;/em&gt;film will also appear on Paramount Plus 45 days after their theatrical releases. MGM movies will go to Paramount Plus once they’re out of the theatrical window — that could mean films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Also, some new movies, including feature projects based on &lt;em&gt;Beavis and Butt-head, Workaholics, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pet Semetary,&lt;/em&gt; will be made exclusively for Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NP5iM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today, ViacomCBS announced it has &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299240/cbs-all-access-subscriber-numbers-paramount-plus-showtime" target="_blank"&gt;19.2 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; between CBS All Access and Showtime &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vKmVso"&gt;Much like CBS All Access, Paramount Plus will also carry some aspect of live sports, news, and events for subscribers. Currently, All Access customers can watch national NFL games carried on CBS via the streaming service, as well as events like the Grammy’s when they air on the network. The company is expanding its sports offering on Paramount Plus, including hosting UEFA soccer games, and other sports that will find a home on the digital service. Paramount Plus will also carry a 24/7 news channel, according to Bakish, and local news and weather updates for subscribers depending on their region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8OwrJ"&gt;Today, ViacomCBS announced it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299240/cbs-all-access-subscriber-numbers-paramount-plus-showtime"&gt;19.2 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; between CBS All Access and Showtime (plus 30.1 million monthly active users for free streaming platform, Pluto TV) domestically, but the goal is to use the plethora of franchises and networks to really compete in the streaming wars. Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;nearing 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and HBO Max has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;17.2 million activations&lt;/a&gt;. Peacock, one of Paramount Plus’ biggest competitors in terms of similar offerings, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;33 million users&lt;/a&gt;, although it’s unclear how many are paid subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRfQmN"&gt;ViacomCBS executives also addressed an international rollout for Paramount Plus. It will launch in Latin America and Canada on the same day as the US, with Australia and the Nordics in the weeks and months to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia made $5 billion during a GPU shortage and expects to do it again in Q1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BPblJRq3sMkPnXCeUEq2wuoYTcs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870718/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y1AzJK"&gt;Nvidia has shared &lt;a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/24/2181882/0/en/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2021.html"&gt;its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the company’s GPUs being in extremely low supply, it didn’t seem to hurt how much money the company made. In fact, it reported a record $5 billion in revenue, which is up 61 percent year-over-year. What’s more impressive is that Nvidia expects to make another $5 billion in revenue during Q1 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53eXog"&gt;This positive outlook is surprising given that Q1 is generally slower than other quarters, even for the biggest tech companies, as it follows the rush of people buying lots of products during the holiday period. It’s generally a slower period in general for product releases across tech and gaming. Also, let’s not forget the GPU shortage is still happening. Nvidia reiterated that sparse supply will continue through the next quarter, but that’s likely factored into its rosy revenue prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYPRBs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sparse GPU supply will continue through the next quarter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnTsUU"&gt;Nvidia says it expects most of that $5 billion revenue estimate in Q1 2022 to come from the gaming market, despite being the segment it’s currently having the toughest time serving. Since the launch of the RTX 30-series desktop graphics cards, leading with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;3090&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;3070&lt;/a&gt;, and followed by other products, Nvidia hasn’t been able to meet the demand — though it’s not the only company affected. AMD has also struggled, perhaps more than Nvidia, to keep a steady stock of graphics cards heading to retailers. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;got comments from both companies on the shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The ongoing pandemic has certainly played a role in this, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;shortage of semiconductor chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hOEGO"&gt;Nvidia recently announced that it’s trying to make it easier for gamers, not cryptocurrency miners, to get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;RTX 3060 desktop graphics card that’s releasing tomorrow for $329&lt;/a&gt;. It’s doing that by implementing GPU driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;software that weakens its ability to farm Ethereum by half&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to discourage crypto miners from buying it. It will also introduce its CMP dedicated mining processor in March, which Nvidia is making to serve the mining community with the hope that they’ll leave more of the gaming GPUs for gamers to purchase. Interestingly, Nvidia said during its investor call that cryptocurrency-related sales accounted for a small slice of its total revenue — just $300 million of $5 billion, suggesting that miners didn’t play a major role in the GPU shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the trailer for the Rugrats reboot headed to Paramount Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5vYZFFJTxk_3V9NqGkSWcZcaKY=/384x0:4536x2768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870487/PressArt_Rugrats_Babies_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2B3im"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; reboot is headed to the new streaming service Paramount Plus this spring, ViacomCBS announced today. The show is described as a “reimagining of the classic ‘90s hit,” and you can see a preview of the new CG-animated style in this trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Nolcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNky0GJG1x0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Osq5R"&gt;But even though the animation might look different, many of the characters should sound the same — Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, Angelica Pickles, Susie Carmichael, and Phil and Lil DeVille will all be voiced by their original voice actors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsLR2x"&gt;The new show is produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJN3NP"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most iconic cartoons recognized by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand-new audience,” said Ramsey Naito, President, Nickelodeon Animation, in a statement. “Having the voice cast behind these special characters come together is one of the essential pieces to making the show recognizable and we can’t wait to watch this talented group bring them to life again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDNQFB"&gt;The original show debuted in August 1991, and was a staple of my childhood. I’m curious to see how this reboot turns out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nickelodeon creates Avatar Studios to create new Avatar, Legend of Korra content</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0uJwa"&gt;ViacomCBS has announced a new studio based entirely around &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJzdxd"&gt;Avatar Studios will create “original content spanning animated series and movies,” according to a press release. &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Korra&lt;/em&gt; original creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, are joining Nickelodeon as co-chief creative officers of Avatar Studios. The first project is an animated theatrical title set to begin production soon. More information will be announced soon, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NxMBb"&gt;Having exclusive &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Korra &lt;/em&gt;content is pretty key for Nickelodeon and ViacomCBS’ new streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;. While the company’s business strategy is to license out a number of its shows and films on a non-exclusive basis, by the time &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;returned to Netflix, subscribers may have associated the show specifically with the streaming platform. The show became the most watched title on Netflix around May 22nd, when it returned to Netflix. The series&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/6y9ofw/no_spoilers_i_think_amazon_just_took_down_avatar/"&gt;previously available on Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYZsnw"&gt;Having those licensing agreements is financially beneficial to ViacomCBS right now, according to comments CEO Bob Bakish has made on previous earnings calls. Some of Netflix’s most watched shows in the US remain ViacomCBS titles, including &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shameless&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; NCIS&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt;. In order to bring people in and get them to subscribe, however, Paramount Plus needs its own exclusives. This is where having a new &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;series could ultimately be very beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM7hsN"&gt;Paramount Plus is ViacomCBS’s rebranded entry into the streaming space. It will launch on March 4th. After Viacom and CBS merged again in 2019, the unified company set out to find a way to use its entire breadth of programming and franchises to make a true competitor to Netflix, Amazon, HBO Max, and Disney’s empire (Disney Plus and Hulu). The new streaming service will have more than 30,000 TV episodes and films from across its various brands, including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures, alongside some aspect of live sports and news. &lt;/p&gt;
