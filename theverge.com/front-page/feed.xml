    <title>SpaceX to acquire small satellite startup Swarm Technologies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX Launches Transporter-1 Mission" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cl6y9QBP4rqKquzpjGhTyEgOKic=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69701138/1230770213.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FOIrXr"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is acquiring the small-satellite data provider Swarm Technologies, scooping up the startup’s roughly 30 employees and its network of 120 tiny satellites. The deal, struck last month, is extremely rare for SpaceX, which normally manufactures its rocket and satellite hardware in-house or hires subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnPdp7"&gt;Swarm revealed the acquisition plans in an August 6th filing with the Federal Communications Commission that requested approval to shift ownership of its satellite and antenna licenses to SpaceX. The merger agreement, in which Swarm will become a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of SpaceX, was inked on July 16th, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ef8Jxp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX benefits from “access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3h5r95"&gt;The acquisition of Swarm marks a rare business maneuver for SpaceX as it deepens its foray into the world of consumer electronics and claws its way out of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;chasm of unprofitability&lt;/a&gt; with Starlink, with the hopes of eventually turning the network into a cash cow to fund Musk’s massive Starship launch system. It’s unclear, though, what specific opportunity SpaceX sees in Swarm to benefit its broadband network. A spokesperson for Swarm declined to comment on the deal, and SpaceX didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHb7WE"&gt;The acquisition will strengthen “the combined companies’ ability to provide innovative satellite services that reach unserved and underserved parts of the world,” Swarm wrote in the FCC filing. “SpaceX will similarly benefit from access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team, as well as from adding this resourceful and effective team to SpaceX.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HeQO9m4VkAMe-OOrzsAAebB1o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772207/Mask_Group_1_1024x759.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Swarm’s SpaceBee satellites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8E4gOP"&gt;Founded in 2016, Swarm offers ultra low-bandwidth data services using its tiny sandwich-sized SpaceBEE satellites that talk to smaller consumer antennas on the ground called “Tiles.” Of the 150 planned, 120 satellites are already in orbit, and the tiles can be installed as cracker-sized chips inside, for example, the circuit board of a device. With GPS built in, devices with a tile installed can be tracked, relay sensor data, or do whatever the customer programs it to do using tiny pings of bandwidth to Swarm’s global satellite network starting at $5 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXgJCz"&gt;SpaceX’s much different Starlink program aims to beam broadband internet into rural areas that lack fiber or physical internet connections. The company already has more than 1,700 of its initial tranche of 4,409 satellites in low-Earth orbit with nearly 100,000 beta users, most of whom paid $499 for a terminal kit and $99 a month for internet. The network is far ahead of competition from UK-backed OneWeb, which has launched 254 satellites so far for its similar — but smaller-sized — broadband network, and Amazon’s budding Kuiper network, which has yet to deploy any satellites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enVFGr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is working on a bunch of new reality shows, and you’re invited </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JGKQJ0aXd6TwrhRT-_aziWCqcA=/84x0:1029x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700942/Screen_Shot_2020_04_23_at_10.52.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svXsky"&gt;Netflix is tripling down on its reality TV programming by renewing its most popular shows and opening up casting for future programming to anyone over the age of 18 in the US, Canada, United Kingdom, or Ireland, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/announcing-largest-reality-casting-call-ever-plus-new-and-returning-series"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrxnWe"&gt;Anyone interested who meets that criteria can submit a one-minute video on Netflix’s new &lt;a href="https://www.netflixreality.com/"&gt;dedicated reality TV site&lt;/a&gt;. The application can be used for multiple shows on Netflix’s current slate, from baking competitions like &lt;em&gt;Nailed It!&lt;/em&gt; to saucier romantic options like &lt;em&gt;Love is Blind. &lt;/em&gt;(Netflix also offers the option to apply to all of its shows at once if you prefer a more “spaghetti meets wall” approach.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CWJb2QT5vv-1WI-F4rVo_49nS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772117/screencapture_netflixreality_submit_your_video_2021_08_09_15_52_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix will let you apply for shows across a broad spectrum of topics at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hQ48A"&gt;Netflix is also renewing several of its most well-known shows, all the better to fill with the new collection of randos it finds online. Arranged marriage docuseries &lt;em&gt;Indian Matchmaking&lt;/em&gt; and food competition &lt;em&gt;The American Barbecue Showdown&lt;/em&gt; are both getting renewed for second seasons, while &lt;em&gt;The Circle &lt;/em&gt;has been renewed for two more seasons of competitive catfishing. In terms of new reality TV, Netflix is casting for a new series it calls &lt;em&gt;Roaring Twenties&lt;/em&gt; focused on, you guessed it, twenty-year-olds living together. The official, only marginally more informative description follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q3EWz4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roaring Twenties&lt;/em&gt; is the coming-of-age story of eight twenty-somethings who set out to find success in life and love in Austin, Texas while learning to navigate the ‘new normal’ of 2020’s America. Living together and leaning on each other, they experience the highs and lows that come with being an adult. After all, your twenties are a crazy, weird, and special time in your life, and you only get to live them once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HHadJ6"&gt;Leaning in even harder into reality TV seems to make a lot of sense for Netflix. In comparison to a big buzzy, expensive property like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher — &lt;/em&gt;which &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/witcher-tv-netflix-budget-cost-game-thrones-comparison/"&gt;reportedly cost around $10 million per episode&lt;/a&gt; — reality TV is cheaper to produce but can still stand out from the more basic fare found on network TV due to Netflix’s ad-free experience. The weirdness and specificity of Netflix’s premises is also a strength, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/netflix-reality-tv-strategy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. It creates some natural buzz (how could something &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/06/netflix-sexy-beasts-dating-show-trailer-watch.html"&gt;as odd as &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beasts &lt;/em&gt;not?&lt;/a&gt;) and offers a little something for everyone. With an even broader net for casting, now Netflix can potentially use a little bit of everyone, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and GoPro are suing Chinese sellers over counterfeit tripods and grips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YJi_2Paescbk6DM6fL4GnsWpMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700716/bfarsace_200914_4190_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera is not a counterfeit.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCZoQK"&gt;Last June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302114/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-knockoffs-store-online-investigators"&gt;Amazon created a Counterfeit Crimes Unit&lt;/a&gt; to fight the knockoffs plaguing its gigantic storefront, and today, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210809005578/en/Amazon-and-GoPro-File-Joint-Lawsuit-against-Counterfeiters"&gt;announcing its first action&lt;/a&gt; against purveyors of fake gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C5MNi"&gt;Amazon and GoPro have sued seven Chinese nationals and a pair of businesses for distributing hard-to-detect knockoffs of its “Handler” floating camera hand grip and “3-Way” tripod grip, ones that blatantly use GoPro’s own logo, in an April 2021 lawsuit that’s just now being unsealed — because there’s a parallel criminal investigation in China against these same sellers, the complaint reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHKUzw"&gt;While the lawsuit doesn’t say how many people actually bought these counterfeit GoPro accessories, it suggests at least some buyers were fooled by the fake products. One wrote they were “very disappointed it was provided by GOPRO. I will not purchase any more products of this brand from now on.” Others were more skeptical: “[It] can’t be a real GoPro stick because it rusted after two days,” wrote another customer, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tripod comparison picture shows a smaller button on the fake, and different patterns of dots." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TvRiqD7w8LsxGzHAcH1c_3IayD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771922/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_tripods.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Many different GoPro fake handles, showing their logos and darker colored foam compare to a legit one" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvpwnr6MeLGNEli8vgHK_wz8NrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771921/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_handles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This image shows a handle with a clear GoPro logo on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ve3qSagbbnxLCeJE7B6GeK2vq2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771920/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_handle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LqtClX"&gt;The differences appear to be fairly subtle: counterfeit tripods, for example, might weigh a little bit less, have a rougher surface, a smaller button, and a different number of “dots” in different places on the arm. The foam might be a slightly darker color, too. It’s not clear why Chinese companies would see the need to counterfeit these products, given that GoPro’s camera mount is an exceptionally easy thing to find third-party attachments for, but perhaps they thought an official logo would help them stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stUTxc"&gt;Amazon says it blocked the entire Amazon seller accounts of these defendants after counterfeits were brought to the company’s attention and that it sent samples of their products to GoPro to help the investigation. Referring these cases to law enforcement is part of the standard procedure, Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit head Kebharu Smith &lt;a href="https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/fighting-fakes-5-questions-for-amazons-counterfeit-crimes-unit/"&gt;said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZyojQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s CCU is composed of former federal prosecutors and investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnyij0"&gt;While it is the first gadget suit from Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit, it’s not the first suit it’s filed. We covered a previous suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562758/instagram-influencer-counterfeit-gucci-dior-amazon-fake-listing"&gt;against sellers of fake luxury goods&lt;/a&gt;, and the company says it’s filed joint lawsuits like this GoPro one with other companies, including “apparel manufacturer HanesBrands, Italian luxury brands Valentino and Ferragamo, cosmetics brand KF Beauty, family travel accessory brand JL Childress, cooler manufacturer YETI, family-owned-and-operated card game company Dutch Blitz, and global board game publisher Asmodee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPSdgD"&gt;Amazon has a long-running problem with counterfeit goods, and other companies have sued before: Apple claimed in 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13343682/fake-apple-chargers-amazon-lawsuit"&gt;that 90 percent of Apple chargers sold on Amazon were fake&lt;/a&gt;, and reporters were able to find quite a few counterfeits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17301714/amazon-counterfeit-goods-crackdown"&gt;even after Amazon’s subsequent crackdown&lt;/a&gt;. We wrote in 2019 about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837359/amazon-basics-fake-sellers-imposters-third-party-marketplace"&gt;how Amazon’s own AmazonBasics products were getting knocked off&lt;/a&gt;. I remember purchasing a counterfeit SanDisk SD card from Amazon a while back myself. “Welcome to the era of fake products,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter &lt;/em&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt;, providing a variety of Amazon examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NCiDto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon just got Fakespot booted off Apple’s iOS App Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580611/fakespot-ios-app-apple-amazon-fake-reviews"},{"title":"Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JgKnCF"&gt;Amazon suggests that, thanks to its efforts, the problem might not be as big as suspected: &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-brand-protection-report"&gt;it released a Brand Protection Report this May&lt;/a&gt; that states the company seized and destroyed more than 2 million counterfeits before they were sent to customers, that it blocked 10 billion “suspected bad listings” before they appeared on the store, and that “fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z0BNo"&gt;Amazon doesn’t publicly say how many products it has on its storefront, though, so it’s impossible to tell how large “0.01%” might be, and thus how many goods might have actually made it through. It’s also not clear how many customers would know they’d been sold fake goods, and think to complain, in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbdJQ6"&gt;GoPro declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish says its will launch wireless 5G service in beta at the end of September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj7W-ZCC1g6M24nmInn6CPhDh84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700580/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish aims to cover 70% of the US population by mid-2023 with wireless service.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ct2cfr"&gt;On an earnings call today, Dish Network execs said that its Las Vegas 5G wireless service is in the final phase of construction and will launch in beta by the end of September. That keeps it just in line with the Q3 deployment goal it gave earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpGzT"&gt;The beta launch is an important first step toward its commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;covering 70 percent of the US population by June 2023&lt;/a&gt;, a target that’s looking more ambitious by the day as the company continues to lose wireless customers. It lost 161,000 subscribers in Q1 of this year, and it just &lt;a href="https://ir.dish.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dish-network-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;reported a net loss of 201,000 wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in Q2. The company stands to lose even more of its remaining 8.9 million wireless subscribers as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;T-Mobile has unveiled a generous promotion&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the very customers it was required to sell to Dish as part of the Sprint merger deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuuRe8"&gt;Dish says the Vegas beta will last a minimum of 90 days, during which it plans to gather customer feedback and troubleshoot issues as its technology transitions from the lab to the real world — chairman Charlie Ergen acknowledges that the network won’t work perfectly at first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuO44z"&gt;Dish also recently signed an agreement with AT&amp;amp;T, on which it will rely for the majority of its service as a wireless service reseller (MVNO) while it goes about building its own network. On today’s call, Dish clarified the role that its new partner will play in the beta launch. It says that the majority of network use in its Las Vegas launch will be on its own network, with AT&amp;amp;T and existing partner T-Mobile’s networks providing some roaming support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1POU7"&gt;Curious to try it out yourself? Anyone interested in testing out the network as part of the beta program can sign up for more information through &lt;a href="https://launch.5gmobilegenesis.com/"&gt;Dish’s Project Genesis website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSy9MW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/"&gt;Gigabyte has been the victim of a cyberattack&lt;/a&gt;, which was reportedly the work of a ransomware outfit called RansomEXX. &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack didn’t have an impact on any of the company’s production systems, but it did affect some internal servers. Currently, some parts of Gigabyte’s website, including its support section, are down, giving customers issues when &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/p0ym6x/trying_to_rma_gigabyte_rtx_2080_super/"&gt;trying to access warranty repair information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/p0uu5x/anyone_have_a_copy_of_the_f4_bios_update_for_the/"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;. The hackers who claim to have carried out the attack are reportedly threatening to release data from the company, including confidential documents from Intel, AMD, and American Megatrends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUVn3o"&gt;Gigabyte is mainly known for its PC components such as motherboards and graphics cards, but it also has a line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299226/gigabyte-aorus-15g-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-features"&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt; and peripherals like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;gaming monitors&lt;/a&gt;, which are often branded with the Aorus name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u0DRNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers included screenshots of documents under NDAs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqs2B"&gt;According to a ransom note and dark web webpage, seen by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RansomEXX threatens to publish 112GB of data it got from Gigabyte and an American Megatrends Git repo. &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; reports that the hackers also include screenshots of documents from Intel, AMD, and American Megatrends that are under an NDA. American Megatrends creates firmware for motherboard and computer manufacturers as well as for &lt;a href="https://www.ami.com/products/bios-uefi-firmware/chromebook-firmware/"&gt;certain Chromebook manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RtCQ0SfpmrE3fsYdb37MG8LLok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771758/Screen_Shot_2021_08_09_at_11.05.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various parts of Gigabyte’s website are nonfunctional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M07l9j"&gt;PC manufacturers aren’t an uncommon target for hackers: earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer was reportedly hit with an attack&lt;/a&gt; by the REvil group, which would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;later go on to target one&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s suppliers. In both cases, hackers threatened to release valuable data if the companies didn’t pay exorbitantly high ransoms of $50 million. The scourge of ransomware has also gone beyond traditional tech companies, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443851/death-ransomware-attack-hospital-germany-cybersecurity"&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;fuel pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CzVXP"&gt;In Gigabyte’s case, the sum that the hackers are seeking doesn’t yet appear to be public. &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; reports, however, that RansomEXX’s ransom notes direct companies to contact an email address to start negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8THiA"&gt;Gigabyte didn’t respond to a request for comment, but it &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company has isolated the affected servers, notified law enforcement, and is beginning an investigation. Gigabyte hasn't publicly named RansomEXX as the responsible party.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is now testing ads in the Shop tab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qm316OkjmIHz_wwn3lB3QyRRMTM=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700385/instahomescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6DUy2"&gt;If you thought Instagram had run out of ad real estate, think again. The company confirmed to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s starting a new test that’ll involve putting ads on its Shop tab. Ads will involve either a single image or carousel of them, and of course, will be shoppable. Only certain advertisers will have access at first, but there are plans to expand the product in the future. (Initial US-based partners include Away, Fenty Beauty, and Clare paint.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShVqc"&gt;Of course, it’s no surprise Instagram is trying more ads in more places — that’s Instagram and its parent company Facebook’s main revenue driver. Earlier this year, Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;officially rolled out&lt;/a&gt; ads in Reels, another new format that debuted only last year. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396841/instagram-reels-ads-stickers-video-facebook"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; sticker ads, which would allow people to include stickers in their stories advertising a product. Users will receive a cut of any revenue made through people tapping on the sticker and buying a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuDtf8"&gt;Basically, if there’s unused space on Instagram, you should expect ads to show up there soon enough. It’s unclear how successful these ads are in driving purchases, but brands presumably will want to try it out regardless, if only to ensure their products are seen by Instagram’s billion users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack is getting into comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A drawing of a person in a suit pointing toward a UFO in the sky" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jD9HjbAdsDsxxS3mFDLwQFAFgIQ=/0x133:1430x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700345/7dad39ad_a226_4caa_8c3b_9bde1b853163_1430x1217.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: A teaser for one of James Tynion IV’s Substack projects | Michael Avon Oeming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i1tAmT"&gt;Substack is trying to put a new spin on webcomics. The newsletter platform announced today that it’s signed a number of comics creators up to use its platform. They’ll email comics out to readers and use Substack’s subscription tools to charge directly for access to their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqLrBm"&gt;It’s a new type of content for Substack, which has predominantly been focused on (written) newsletters covering topics like politics, tech, and culture. But the expansion to comics makes plenty of sense. Comics have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295369/webcomics-xkcd-questionable-content-dinosaur-comics-90s-internet-social-media"&gt;long been successful online&lt;/a&gt;, but they’ve largely been supported by ads and merch sales. Substack offers comics creators a chance at something a little closer to selling readers a new issue at the store each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FeIRoD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Substack has started funding podcasters, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9qSlS"&gt;Among the creators signed up is &lt;a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era"&gt;James Tynion IV&lt;/a&gt;, who until now was the head writer of DC’s flagship &lt;em&gt;Batman &lt;/em&gt;title. Tynion wrote in a blog post that he will be using Substack to “create a new slate of original comic book properties” and build “a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms.” Substack has also signed up &lt;a href="https://www.copperbottle.net/p/welcome-to-copper-bottle?showWelcome=true"&gt;Saladin Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ostertag.substack.com/welcome"&gt;Molly Knox Ostertag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bestjackettpress.substack.com/"&gt;Scott Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRRC4z"&gt;Substack is available for anyone to use for free, but it’s been signing writers to a program called Substack Pro that offers them upfront payments and support, so they can try going independent without being entirely reliant on subscribers (who may not materialize) during their first year or so on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyp3Bs"&gt;The people Substack signs up can also speak to where the platform wants to attract more writers, so today’s announcement can be seen as a sign to other comics artists that they may want to consider the newsletter format. If it continues to focus on comics — and who knows just how good of a reading experience Substack will be for visuals — the platform could pull some users away from Patreon, which has been big with artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRub3c"&gt;Substack has also been trying to expand into podcasts. The service has its own podcast player and publishing tool, and it just backed &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-funding-podcasts-investment-04b70b34-dc02-4f68-af89-196390f7dd63.html"&gt;the launch of a new podcast network&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s updated data transfer tool can port events to Google Calendar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9kdvT0ZLGLR0tHIcukOFiFpD2LQ=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700286/CD21_478_NRP_Data_Portability_2H_Launch_Inline.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbnspc"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/improving-user-experience-in-our-transfer-your-information-tool/"&gt;has updated&lt;/a&gt; its data transfer tool, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tyi/"&gt;Transfer Your Information&lt;/a&gt;, with two new destinations for information associated with your Facebook account: Photobucket and Google Calendar (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transfer-photobucket-google-calendar-105303219.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Facebook allowed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280583/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data-sharing-project-images-video"&gt;photo transfers to services like Google Photos&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but the company says Facebook Events are a new data type for the tool it created as part of &lt;a href="https://datatransferproject.dev/"&gt;the Data Transfer Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8j63X"&gt;Support for Photobucket and Google Calendar comes alongside a larger redesign of Transfer Your Information, which Facebook claims makes the service “simpler and more intuitive.” Among the improvements, it should be easier to see the status of each transfer, start multiple transfers to the same location, and filter through and select what data you actually want to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH5VU9"&gt;Transfer Your Information has expanded since &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/data-portability-photo-transfer-tool/"&gt;Facebook launched the service in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of Facebook’s tool and its participation in the Data Transfer Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"&gt;with Microsoft, Google, Twitter, and Apple&lt;/a&gt; is to allow users to transfer their information between platforms and services without having to download it first. Members of the project develop “adapters” between their various proprietary APIs, so for example, Facebook Photos can transfer over to Google Photos without confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OCvkBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s tool for transferring media to Google Photos is now available for everyone ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280583/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data-sharing-project-images-video"},{"title":"Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter partner for ambitious new data project ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GGZgQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate cryptocurrency tax reporting deal fails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cynthia Lummis and Pat Toomey" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siBB3NzTyAox9VW1bIxyuhLQxOU=/0x0:5414x3609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700277/1234592087.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xeJ6Ss"&gt;A bipartisan deal to exempt cryptocurrency developers from certain tax reporting requirements failed in the Senate after a senator rejected a motion to approve the amendment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OKLeX"&gt;Last week, the Senate released an over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; package that included over $550 billion in new spending to strengthen roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like high-speed broadband. The bill also sought to institute new tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions, a provision that would raise an estimated $28 billion to offset some infrastructure costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lzyPv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KxiF8g"&gt;But the digital assets community and lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) argued that the proposed definition of “broker” was too vague and could extend reporting requirements to wallet developers and miners. Over the following days, dueling bipartisan groups of senators worked to remedy the problem, ending in today’s agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZBWCy"&gt;The deal announcement comes after the Senate held a series of procedural votes late Sunday to advance the original bill, including the controversial cryptocurrency language. Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) put out the amendment Monday that would clarify the “broker” definition, but the amendment was defeated when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) objected to the motion later this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1M89Q"&gt;“We came together to provide greater clarity on the rules for who are the actual brokers of a cryptocurrency,” Toomey said at a press conference Monday. “We’re not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBgPHa"&gt;Notably, Wyden was not signed on to Monday’s amendment clarifying the language. A source familiar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the senator did not put his name on the amendment because he feared that future administrations could read the proposed language and interpret it as including miners and developers. The amendment text has yet to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY6p0r"&gt;“We’ve been working hard to get a deal,” Wyden said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1424731514147938304"&gt;in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t believe the cryptocurrency amendment language on offer is good enough to protect privacy and security, but it’s certainly better than the underlying bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63vzA7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 9th, 4:59 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article and headline have been edited to reflect that the amendment failed on the Senate floor Monday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fantasian wraps up with part two release on August 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgUQhIj0UdrbC5vIpukvmAVQBFQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700059/ss007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cxtx4f"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a beautiful roleplaying game from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, first debuted on Apple Arcade, it wasn’t actually the full game. Instead, it was described as the first part of a longer story. Now the conclusion to that story is almost upon us: part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian &lt;/em&gt;is launching this Friday, August 13th as part of Arcade’s weekly update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXOEht"&gt;According to developer Mistwalker, the second half features “anywhere between 40 to 60 hours for players to experience.” It also introduces 50 new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted vistas to explore&lt;/a&gt;, along with 34 new songs from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu"&gt;His work on the game is also currently streaming on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45GpQa"&gt;In a statement, Sakaguchi said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Mjgbo8"&gt;The release of Part 2 of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; marks the completion of the saga. It ended up being, rather unexpectedly, about twice the volume of Part 1 and is more quest-driven, giving players the ability to progress through the world at their own pace. Boss encounters are even more unique than before. On behalf of all the dev team members, diorama artisans, and musical talent including Uematsu-san — I think we can safely say that we left nothing on the table. We have carefully sculpted the experience preserving the ‘warmth’ of the dioramas with every attention to detail. I encourage everyone to experience this mysterious ‘emotional’ energy, which is at the very heart of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ76c1"&gt;Alongside &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s big update, Apple’s gaming service will also get a brand-new game on Friday called &lt;em&gt;Wurdweb&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as a “relaxing word puzzle game,” and it was co-developed by Aran Koning (part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18287223/sokpop-collective-patreon-experimental-games-subscription-crowdfunding-creators"&gt;the Sokpop Collective&lt;/a&gt;) and Adriaan de Jongh (best-known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837528/hidden-folks-iphone-steam-factory-update"&gt;his work on &lt;em&gt;Hidden Folks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
