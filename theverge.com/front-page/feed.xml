    <title>Ahead of IPO, Coinbase users speak out about locked accounts and lost money  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXXvJT"&gt;As it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;prepares to go public&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase is still struggling to provide support to customers who have issues &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1220367/coinbases-customer-complaints-more-than-doubled-in-january/"&gt;with funds being available&lt;/a&gt;, or their accounts being hacked or locked, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/coinbase-bitcoin-complaints.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exchange is often considered to be one of the safer bets for those looking to invest in crypto, but the story shows that users who run into trouble could be left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuvCDA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of dozens of customers who have had money stolen from their accounts, or who have had their accounts locked (which &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mc7ewq/reply_case_04932724_disabled_to_deposit_and_buy/"&gt;seems to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mc6qoj/120000_wire_transfer_sent_and_account_was/"&gt;a frequent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mcbt9g/i_want_my_money_back/"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt;), and their difficulties getting in touch with a real person at Coinbase. The company’s vice president of customer experience says that it faces “a unique set of customer experience challenges” due to the fact that crypto trading is always active, and has recently seen an increase in demand. But Coinbase’s trust issues go back a long time — back in 2014 we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/7/5386222/a-string-of-thefts-hit-coinbase-bitcoins-most-reputable-wallet-service"&gt;how some customers lost trust in the company after their accounts were hacked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fky7wy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If customers feel like they can’t trust a platform, they’ll look for alternatives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FyiCmI"&gt;Coinbase also told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that real humans reply to requests for help, and that it had added 2,000 people to its support team in recent months. The company also publicly committed to &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"&gt;better and faster customer support back in January&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/"&gt;the Coinbase subreddit&lt;/a&gt; is still mostly dedicated to people talking about how the company’s support hasn’t been helping them (though it is worth noting that the sample is somewhat self-selecting, and Reddit posts aren’t verified proof of an issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3r16F"&gt;Coinbase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;may not be alone&lt;/a&gt; in having poor customer support, but having a reputation for not helping its users could be problematic for a company that wants to be publicly traded — if customers feel like they can't trust a platform, they’ll look for alternatives. And, as a a financial crimes expert points out in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, the company will also be subject to greater regulatory oversight and visibility if it’s public.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New black hole image shows off vortex of magnetic chaos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LOIxm-ejq7qcXgN2_MDGM8Q6dVQ=/0x340:1981x1661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021489/m87_lo_april11_polarimetric_average_image_ml_deband_cc_8bit_srgb.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of the M87 supermassive black hole, captured by scientists of the Event Horizon Telescope and released on Wednesday. | EHT Collaboration&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsDnBA"&gt;A new, detailed shot of a black hole reveals spiraling lines of mysterious magnetic forces that give astronomers an unprecedented look at how these cosmic monsters behave. It’s an intimate portrait of the black hole at the center of the gigantic M87 galaxy, which lies some 55 million light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77roPF"&gt;Black holes are scattered across the universe and exist in almost every galaxy, but their behavior remains one of the most intriguing mysteries in astronomy. The image helps depict how the black hole violently swallows matter and shoots energetic jets back out from its core. Those jets can extend thousands of lightyears into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU2ljr"&gt;Today’s photo is from the same international team of radio astronomers who shot&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18303661/first-picture-black-hole-sagittarius-event-horizon-telescope"&gt; the first photo&lt;/a&gt; of a black hole, ever, in 2019. In the two years since then, more than 300 scientists have been scrutinizing data from that image as part of a global project called The Event Horizon Telescope. They found that a large portion of the dark-orange light surrounding the black hole’s mouth is filtered through a soup of magnetic energy that can be mapped and measured in unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The first image of a black hole" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqH1gXZlRtN4lui1sQbkJ0__MMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16022135/A_Consensus_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=298276" target="_blank"&gt;The Event Horizon Telescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The first image of a black hole released in 2019&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZPXS"&gt;So, putting on a pair of the radio-astronomy equivalent of polarized sunglasses, astronomers sharpened their focus on the cosmic body to reveal distinct lines of magnetic energy flowing inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU3MsU"&gt;The result is a “major milestone,” says Iván Martí-Vidal, coordinator of the Event Horizon Telescope’s Polarimetry Working Group. The new image helps astronomers better understand the physics behind the first image, he says. Today’s image hints at the role magnetic turbulence plays in a black hole’s ability to gobble up cosmic material and shoot matter out into the universe. Astronomers are still trying to understand what steers this chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple picked a truly embarrassing time to wrongly reject a simple app update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Yt7HYh4fyFtuk8YPRZj7Yd-hKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021141/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnlbd"&gt;Apple has a rocky relationship with some iOS developers because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;its seemingly arbitrary decisions over what gets published and when&lt;/a&gt; — and now, because of a dumb miss, it’s being accused of putting profits ahead of human rights in Myanmar by the founder of ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, even though that’s probably not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0d777E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-blocks-app-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348961%2Fapple-protonvpn-app-security-update-rejection-myanmar-andy-yen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Proton founder Andy Yen writes&lt;/a&gt; that Apple blocked an important security update to the company’s privacy-protecting ProtonVPN software simply because Apple didn’t like the app’s description, specifically this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ifnRaK"&gt;Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of helping bring online freedom to more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S7sR08"&gt;If you’re having a hard time finding anything objectionable there, you’re not alone — but Apple told Proton it wasn’t okay to encourage “users to bypass geo-restrictions or content limitations.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic-9MFpvsv7azZgAvWDNllRo0bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395261/apple_blocks_protonvpn_update.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEVg5e"&gt;The context here is that VPNs have become a critical tool for protesters in Myanmar to sidestep an huge internet crackdown during the country’s ongoing, bloody military coup. One researcher &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/myanmar-citizens-find-ways-around-crackdown-on-internet?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that VPN use has increased 7,200 percent since early last month, when the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22269831/myanmar-orders-block-twitter-facebook-instagram-military-coup"&gt;Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0U1f9I"&gt;I’m with &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/03/apple_protonvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber on this&lt;/a&gt;: I highly doubt Apple made a conscious decision to deny ProtonVPN to Myanmar — the company’s smart enough to know how that would look, and it’s not like the &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; was blocked, just a security update. Yen is an outspoken critic of the App Store now, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;told Congress (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) last year how he’d been strong-armed by Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z9VyC"&gt;But the fact it’s just a security update makes the rejection &lt;em&gt;extra dumb&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;because Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299814/apple-app-store-policies-ios-bug-fixes-approval-dispute-appeal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;explicitly said&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it’d no longer hold up bug fixes because of these arbitrary guideline violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wKSyY"&gt;Regardless, Apple comes off looking a little like the bad guy here, especially now that ProtonVPN has taken the high road and ceded to Apple’s demands. “Due to the emergency situation in Myanmar, we removed the language about challenging governments which Apple found objectionable, and the app was finally approved,” Yen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31FBS"&gt;That perception seems like it’s going to be increasingly hard to fight, now that antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s App Store has been heating up in Congress and the courts, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;the Epic App Store trial set to begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bj9fA"&gt;It doesn’t help when Apple is seemingly caught breaking its own rules and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;needing to apologize&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when it could be seen as retaliation against an app developer (Yen) who’d previously spoken out. Last year, many other developers weren’t willing to come forward and admit they’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;forced to add in-app purchases to their apps&lt;/a&gt;, specifically because they feared retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BAN88j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple apologizes to WordPress, won’t force the free app to add purchases after all","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"},{"title":"Apple made ProtonMail add in-app purchases, even though it had been free for years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"},{"title":"Apple might appease antitrust concerns by suggesting third-party apps to new iPhone owners","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21563168/apple-antitrust-third-party-app-setup"},{"title":"Apple says App Store appeals process is now live, so developers can start challenging decisions","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21406112/apple-app-store-appeals-process-live-guidelines-challenge-antitrust-fortnite"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitter may make tweeting more stressful with new emoji reactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVlpGkcNVRzftxpKtPMmq4PhGMk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020795/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96Awmb"&gt;Have you ever been scrolling through Twitter and thought&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“This website could really use some Facebook-style emoji reactions”? Yeah, me neither. Nonetheless, the company has been surveying users throughout the past month about that possibility, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKOFXn"&gt;Per screenshots of the survey that a Twitter user shared, the proposed emoji reactions could include the basics — a laughing face with tears, a thinking face, a crying face — and some spicier variations — shocked faces, angry faces, fire emojis. They could also include a downvote or dislike option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvRCsp"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“We’re exploring additional ways for people to express themselves in conversations happening on Twitter.” The spokesperson emphasizes that Twitter’s research is still in its early stages and noted that the emojis would exist in addition to the current “heart” button, rather than replacing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kIfqb"&gt;Twitter’s design chief has also indicated that such features might be coming soon in a few &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1372717290295238658"&gt;enigmatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1372726525729017856"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CAyQng"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Per this survey I just took, Twitter is considering adding emoji reaction sets and downvoting. I think either of those might be what forces me off this site. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uEgtmrSk7F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uEgtmrSk7F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— john d moore (@jdm0079) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jdm0079/status/1372630471419469825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4oFGwC"&gt;Neither emoji reactions nor downvotes would be a unique feature of Twitter. Facebook employs a set of the former, and the latter is a central feature of Reddit and YouTube comment sections. That said, Reddit and comment sections tend to operate more anonymously than Twitter and Facebook, where users more commonly exist and post as their public selves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKr1MQ"&gt;That’s why this is an incredibly stressful announcement for me. If I receive downvotes on a random meme I post on Reddit from my entirely anonymous account, I will not blink twice — they’re downvoting the meme, not me. But I can only imagine that a downvote on a tweet, coming from my personal account with my name and picture attached, will feel like a personal affront, and it will be embarrassing and devastating enough to drive me off the site and force me to find alternative hobbies. Actually, never mind. I’m totally in favor of these features. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dyson’s new V15 Detect vacuum uses lasers to guilt you into doing a better job of cleaning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykZDY1js0klu5nERhwGkS-l2Y-w=/0x202:1914x1478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020705/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.34.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VzVeh"&gt;Dyson has a new flagship vacuum cleaner, the $699 V15 Detect, which adds a laser dust detection system that’s designed to illuminate the dust on your floors so you can better clean it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZAjJz"&gt;Based on Dyson’s images showing how the laser works, though, it looks like the V15 Detect will primarily help you feel a sense of guilt and / or horror at just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; dusty your kitchen floor is. Unlike most vacuums with lights on the cleaning head — which help you see where you’re vacuuming — the new lasers are designed to help you see &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you’re vacuuming. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WBJjPEVjgucjTbIwAEPgiI4aF0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395287/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.36.14_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1jwGI9"&gt;The new model replaces 2019’s V11 at the top of Dyson’s range. Like that model, this one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516117/dyson-v11-torque-drive-animal-review-cordless-vacuum"&gt;features an LCD display&lt;/a&gt; to convey more information to users, with the ability to display different vacuum modes and how much battery life is left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zwk6pO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dyson’s new $700 vacuum uses a screen to fight range anxiety","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516117/dyson-v11-torque-drive-animal-review-cordless-vacuum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WuyILi"&gt;The other big addition, aside from the dust-illuminating laser, is a new acoustic piezo sensor, which (combined with a new microprocessor) monitors the air intake of the vacuum to determine both the size and quantity of the dust being vacuumed up. That information gets relayed to the built-in LCD (so you can get an idea of what you’re vacuuming, I guess). More importantly, it also gets relayed to the main motor, which can increase power and suction if the vacuum detects a lot of large dust particles or debris. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3deFLp"&gt;The new vacuum is part of a refreshed range of Dyson cleaners that are also set to debut starting today, including a new larger Dyson Outsize model and the Dyson Omni-glide, which offers an almost mop-like cleaning head that can be moved freely in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUwLTE"&gt;All three products are available now from Dyson’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MrBeast launches $2 million fund to invest in up-and-coming creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of MrBeast." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1ZDD8zOsJrPZAKr-sL59N6Ouxw=/88x0:1140x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020695/18.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson. | Photo: Night Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wow8GJ"&gt;MrBeast said last year that he wanted a way to invest in up-and-coming creators, help them blow up, and get a cut of their business in return — and today, he’s announcing a plan to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLNV5"&gt;The hit YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is launching a $2 million investment fund that will offer creators up to $250,000 in exchange for a stake in their channels. The fund is part of a new company called &lt;a href="https://getjuice.com/"&gt;Creative Juice&lt;/a&gt;, in which Donaldson is an investor, and which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance"&gt;announced this afternoon in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTyauU"&gt;“We’re gonna make sure we find [creators] that actually need a giant cash inflow and aren’t just trying to go buy a Lamborghini,” Donaldson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJcttY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Juice is going to change so much you guys don’t even understand. Genuinely excited :)&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1374806609604583429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iRvj4"&gt;Details about the investment fund are limited right now. Creative Juice hasn’t said when it will launch or what type of creators it’s looking to invest in. Donaldson said the idea is to help YouTubers “pour gas on the fire” the way a business might by raising an influx of cash once they’re already growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuIcB"&gt;MrBeast is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20924718/mrbeast-youtube-stunts-challenges-money-philanthropy-creators-morgz"&gt;one of the biggest creators on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He has nearly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/videos"&gt;56 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and gets tens of millions of views per video (his most recent, posted a week ago, already has 35 million views). He’s known for pulling off goofy, supersized stunts — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwy_rKc7gI"&gt;like making a “2,000 gallon” cereal bowl&lt;/a&gt; — but mainly, he’s known for giving away cars, houses, and cash as part of his videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QENCYp"&gt;The investment fund is just one part of what Creative Juice plans to offer. The company is developing tools to help creators track their performance across platforms. Investors are calling it “Square for creators” and say it plans to launch a suite of products to help creators operate more like small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0eClvs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like when I see a channel that I think will blow up, I wish I could just like buy shares in it or something lol&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1333861470216609794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Major subreddits are going dark to protest Reddit allegedly hiring a controversial UK politician</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9VmB_dLy6l-sBzJTQ4oJl_O7Fpc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020639/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O35Lzl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit says it’s cut ties with an employee widely identified as former UK politician Aimee Knight, following a shutdown of hundreds of communities. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CEO Steve Huffman posted a statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; confirming that the site had been overzealous trying to prevent harassment, resulting in a moderator being banned for posting an article that referenced Knight’s name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plupza"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We would like to give you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we took to prevent doxxing and harassment. As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on [Reddit Public Access Network]. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her,” wrote Huffman. “Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQ3mrB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original article follows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0urtNH"&gt;Hundreds of Reddit communities have locked down to protest Reddit’s handling of a controversy involving former UK politician Aimee Knight. More than 200 subreddits have set their status to private in the past day, including the 27 million-member forum r/Music, as well as large boards dedicated to Apple Mac computers and the games &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EajxTP"&gt;Moderators are demanding a statement about Knight, whom Reddit apparently hired in recent months. Knight was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/12/green-party-failed-to-properly-investigate-child-abuser-report"&gt;previously suspended from the Green Party&lt;/a&gt; after selecting her father — later convicted of violent sexual assault on a child — as her election agent in a 2017 political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zHGDCK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit says it added filters as a result of harassment and doxxing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy6o4Z"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blank-Cheque/comments/mbmthf/why_is_this_subreddit_private_see_here_for_answers/"&gt;Reddit moderator Blank-Cheque’s post outlines&lt;/a&gt;, the current controversy exploded yesterday, when Reddit &lt;a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/mbbm2c/welcome_back_subreddit_statement/"&gt;banned a UK politics subreddit moderator&lt;/a&gt; for linking to an article that mentioned Knight. Reddit reversed the ban and posted an explanatory statement, saying it was fighting a harassment campaign against an employee. (The post didn’t mention Knight by name, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/gs0bude/"&gt;an administrator wrote&lt;/a&gt; that they were “unable to comment on specific employment details.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRj1Og"&gt;“Earlier this month, a Reddit employee was the target of harassment and doxxing,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/"&gt;the post said&lt;/a&gt;. “Reddit activated standard processes to protect the employee from such harassment, including initiating an automated moderation rule to prevent personal information from being shared. The moderation rule was too broad, and this week it incorrectly suspended a moderator who posted content that included personal information.” Reddit didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB5VuD"&gt;Reddit said that “our intent was never to remove any and all mentions of this admin’s name.” But Reddit’s statement failed to satisfy several moderators, who noted that Knight had occupied a public political position and the article hadn’t linked her name with her employment at Reddit. “You’ve completely ignored the real issue: the person you have hired is, at best, sympathetic to pedophilia,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/grzpzfv/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one popular comment&lt;/a&gt; reads. “I don’t condone doxxing virtually anyone, but what you’re describing isn’t doxxing. It’s posting the name of a public figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWQdtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve completely ignored the real issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DwYeyu"&gt;Knight, who is a transgender woman, has previously been targeted for harassment by anti-trans activists. She was a volunteer moderator on subreddits like r/lgbt, and she &lt;a href="https://nowthisnews.com/news/queer-subreddit-attacks-are-forcing-moderators-to-demand-action"&gt;helped write an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the site’s administrators about anti-LGBT harassment last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZTrDA"&gt;Knight was a Green Party spokesperson and a candidate for deputy leadership. But she was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/31/green-party-launches-inquiry-as-it-suspends-aimee-challenor"&gt;suspended in 2018&lt;/a&gt; amid an inquiry involving her father David Challenor — who was convicted that year of raping and torturing a 10-year-old child. Knight had selected Challenor as her election agent after he had been arrested and charged with the crime in 2016. “On reflection, I can understand that it was unacceptable for me to appoint my dad as my election agent when he had been arrested. I can now understand the potential risks of that decision,” she wrote after the suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTKEir"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/images/national-site/Final%20report%20-%20Executive%20summary-%20cover.pdf"&gt;An independent report concluded&lt;/a&gt; that as a result of Knight and other members’ actions, “someone who had committed serious sexual offenses was given roles of responsibility within the Green Party during a period of almost two years.” Soon after, in 2019, Knight was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Farticle%2Flib-dems-suspend-trans-campaigner-over-tweets-jcsg0tdtq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348255%2Freddit-moderator-blackout-protest-aimee-knight-uk-green-party" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also suspended&lt;/a&gt; by the Liberal Democrats party when her now-husband appeared to post comments about having fantasies involving sex with children on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://coventryobserver.co.uk/news/exclusive-transgender-activist-aimee-challenor-no-longer-in-coventry-lib-dem-post-amid-investigation-into-safeguarding-complaints/"&gt;Knight said&lt;/a&gt; that the account had been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="z91eqV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit spent years grappling with subreddits that sexualized children&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmJ66w"&gt;Some of Knight’s loudest critics are anti-transgender writers and activists who have baselessly painted trans women in general as sexual predators. That includes former TV comedian Graham Linehan, who widely publicized Knight’s Reddit employment on his Substack newsletter. Linehan was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/27/twitter-closes-graham-linehan-account-after-trans-comment"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for posting anti-trans commentary, and his work includes posing as a queer woman on a dating service, then &lt;a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/02/21/graham-linehan-women-her-dating-app-trans-transphobia-backlash/?fbclid=IwAR3sOHeUFNOCN4pdFDvXrQXAQqtnUolo89e2lKQ_P5NTDe9uZyxDu3CXRkU"&gt;publicly posting the profiles&lt;/a&gt; of trans women from the app. Linehan prominently posted Knight’s deadname (or pre-transition name) and referred to her with a hateful term used by anti-trans activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsuEl2"&gt;To some Reddit members, Knight’s alleged hiring echoed a years-long controversy over how Reddit handled child sexualization in the past. Until 2011, the site &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5842584/americas-most-prestigious-magazine-publisher-returns-to-pedophilia-bait"&gt;hosted a “jailbait” subreddit&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to posting pictures of underage girls, something Reddit’s former general manager defended as “the price of free speech” on the site. The subreddit’s creator, &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web"&gt;known as Violentacrez&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly had close relationships with several early Reddit employees. Reddit later banned r/jailbait, and it’s since attempted a major cleanup of the site. Among other things, in 2018, it was one of the first major platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847186/reddit-qanon-milliondollarextreme-ban-sam-hyde"&gt;ban the violent QAnon conspiracy movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okcjGb"&gt;“This site still has a major pedophilia problem and a person in the role of ‘community management’ has troubling connections to pedophilia,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/grzkk64/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;wrote one moderator&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think the admin is a pedophile herself, but she has shown in multiple ways that she cannot be trusted to handle the issue properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R379IB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We as moderators are volunteers, using one of the only tools we have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z8DXc"&gt;Reddit moderators are largely volunteers, in contrast with Reddit’s paid administrative staff. And moderators have had a frequently tense relationship with the company — which is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/reddit-chief-financial-officer-ipo.html"&gt;rumored to be considering&lt;/a&gt; an initial public offering. They’ve complained that Reddit offers inadequate tools for keeping subreddits in order and has failed to mitigate harassment from users, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-reddit-moderators-speak-out.html"&gt;including sexist abuse and death threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs3vyK"&gt;Contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, several moderation teams said they planned to keep their subreddits private until Reddit either responds directly about Knight’s employment or fires her. “What I want is a real response about the process that led them to believe hiring her was a good idea,” wrote Blank-Cheque, one of the blackout’s organizers and a moderator for r/thatHappened, which has 1.3 million members. “My personal aim is to remain locked down until Reddit issues a satisfactory statement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJnmV"&gt;The moderation team behind r/Music, one of the largest forums on Reddit, said in a statement that they wanted a public promise to sever ties with Knight. They’re also looking for a “considerable contribution” to charities for victims of child abuse. “We as moderators are volunteers, using one of the only tools we have access to invoke change. It’s our responsibility to lead our communities in a way that would elicit meaningful, measurable improvements from the Reddit admins.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is officially rebooting National Treasure as a streaming TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2dE0oqmoGIw2B5D9LmVH2Hw8Ws=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020607/national_treasure_book_of_secrets_cast_disney.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8stL3D"&gt;Disney is officially bringing back its long-dormant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251444/national-treasure-disney-plus-series-development-theatrical-movie-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Treasure &lt;/em&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; with a new TV series for Disney Plus. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/national-treasure-tv-series-reimagening-latina-lead-disney-plus-mira-nair-1234720950/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the series has been given a ten-episode greenlight and will reimagine the treasure-hunting franchise with a younger, more diverse cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR19rK"&gt;The new series will reportedly feature a new main character, Jess Morales, a twenty-year-old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act"&gt;DREAMer&lt;/a&gt; who will (in National Treasure traditional) “uncover her mysterious family history and recover lost treasure.” The show, set to be directed by &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/tag/mira-nair/"&gt;Mira Nair&lt;/a&gt;, is also said to look to examine “issues of identity, community, historical authorship and patriotism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TqZem"&gt;The original films — which starred Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates — take a decidedly apolitical stance to American history, using symbols like the Declaration of Independence as Americana-themed clues in the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-esque treasure hunt. A reboot that’s willing to more critically examine America’s place in history could be an interesting new spin on the franchise, depending on how it’s handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO6xn3"&gt;Also on board with the project is Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the two original films, and Marianne and Cormac Wibberley, who were part of the writing team on both &lt;em&gt;National Treasure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxdwgt"&gt;The new project is also separate from the long-gestating third &lt;em&gt;National Treasure &lt;/em&gt;film, which has been stuck in development hell for over a decade but would — at least in theory — see Cage and the original cast of the first two films return for another adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not your imagination — that vaccination website really is crawling along</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Maryland County Hosts Community Clinic For COVID-19 Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1I8vLKXFeyCTL3-x51trWw2g9E=/0x43:7916x5320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020575/1308672315.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyRY1D"&gt;On paper, using a website to schedule your vaccine appointment seems like an easy way to gain access to much needed COVID-19 immunizations. But &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2021/03/24/we-ran-tests-on-every-states-covid-19-vaccine-website"&gt;a new investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that state-run vaccine websites are slow to load on mobile devices, compounding what can be an already intimidating sign-up experience for people who are less comfortable online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2nt4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; conducted its performance tests using &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse"&gt;Google’s open-source Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; tool, in this case relying on the tool’s ability to measure the time it takes for a site to load and be functional. For this test, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; focused on the performance of the mobile version of sites on the Chrome browser and conducted the tests from three separate locations (New York, Texas, and California). Nevada’s state vaccine site was the slowest to load, taking 15.7 seconds to fully load in comparison to the fastest (Puerto Rico) at 1.4 seconds, and the average (Colorado) at 5.9 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spread of state vaccine site loading times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T6R0Gr"&gt;The causes for these slowdowns vary, but in the case of the Nevada site, &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;suggests that an abundance of interactive, embedded content could be contributing to the slowness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zskOcg"&gt;Nevada’s vaccination page features several embedded YouTube videos and Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram posts that offer public health information, featuring health professionals answering common questions in both English and Spanish. Our tests show that Nevada’s page has the lowest average performance score of all the sites we examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q5O8E1"&gt;All of that extra information is great, but I think the confusion also arises for less web-literate people because these sites don’t work like scheduling a traditional doctor’s appointment over the phone. Being presented with a bunch of links from the original site out to other vaccine provider’s websites was intimidating for my grandparents — who often worry about getting “lost” online — and I imagine it would be for many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAtx1p"&gt;The situation is reminiscent of other times government organizations have been tasked with building out essential online infrastructure, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814098/why-did-the-tech-savvy-obama-administration-launch-a-busted-healthcare-website"&gt;the rollout of healthcare.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The federal site’s issues have since been resolved, and state health departments are working at a much smaller scale, but some of the problems are similar. It’s not that these departments are incapable of making a website, it’s that time and resources are stretched thin, and many of them have never really been tasked with a project so huge. “They’ve never required the infrastructure that they do now,” Ohio State University health services professor Tory Hogan tells &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMG27e"&gt;Third-party solutions have sprung up in response to these inadequacies, from startups focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;connecting people with leftover vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; like Dr. B, to independent vaccine hunters &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22339959/covid-19-vaccine-appointments-facebook-groups-extra"&gt;booking appointments for strangers&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s no one solution, at least not until President Biden’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;promised vaccine finding website&lt;/a&gt; launches on May 1st. Here’s hoping that website works better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;
