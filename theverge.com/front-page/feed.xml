    <title>Juul settles with North Carolina in first teen vaping lawsuit </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHNsjcRoLv10d7ALmZnwNl7GNBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516503/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rSe6j"&gt;Juul has agreed to settle its first state lawsuit over deceptive business practices with North Carolina, a move that will limit the vaping company’s marketing claims and placement of products in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGlXC"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Juul will no longer use marketing strategies geared toward young people, including most social media marketing campaigns, advertising near schools, and sponsoring sporting events or concerts. The company also cannot use models under 35 years old for advertisements in the state, and it’s required that Juul products are sold behind the counters of stores, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252318958.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Juul will also pay a $40 million fine to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr6eM2"&gt;“North Carolina is now the first state in the nation to hold Juul accountable for its instrumental role in sparking the epidemic of youth vaping and its resulting nicotine addiction,” North Carolina attorney general Josh Stein &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a press statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SstqtQ"&gt;Juul will also send undercover teen agents to 1,000 stores each year to make sure Juul products aren’t being sold to those &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review/nc"&gt;under age 18&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb7uxG"&gt;“This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1XOIs"&gt;This is the first known lawsuit Juul has settled for its deceptive marketing practices, but it’s far from the last on the docket. The company faces similar lawsuits in at least nine other states, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/north-carolina-wins-40-million-settlement-in-juul-lawsuit.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and at least 100 schools have joined a &lt;a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/school-districts-are-suing-juul-over-youth-vaping-do-they-stand-a-chance/2020/02"&gt;national lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; to recoup costs associated with anti-vaping campaigns. Thirty-nine other states are also considering similar lawsuits to North Carolina’s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252420018.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG6Qb8"&gt;Juul stopped selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919415/juul-suspends-sale-fruity-flavor-pods-ecigarette"&gt;fruity flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; like mango in 2019 as part of an effort to head off these mounting lawsuits. The company ceased selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953865/juul-mint-flavor-discontinue-ban-fda-vaping-illness"&gt;mint-flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; shortly after. Under the North Carolina settlement, Juul cannot introduce new flavors or new levels of nicotine in the state without prior approval from the FDA. The FDA is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/23/democrats-slam-fda-crack-down-juul/"&gt;already reviewing&lt;/a&gt; whether Juul and other e-cigarette products can stay on the market beyond September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s new update fixes its crashing problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you’ve been experiencing the bug where the iOS version of Snapchat crashes at launch, it seems that there’s now an update to fix it available in the App Store. The bug that’s been fixed by the update didn’t appear to have affected the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;Before updating to the latest version, 11.34.1.35, the app would give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard on my iPhone 12 Mini. Now, I’m no longer getting the error, and have successfully been able to send a Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kodK5Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976"&gt;This is what the bug looked like&lt;/a&gt; when it was present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80qzZk"&gt;The Snapchat Support Twitter account hasn’t yet tweeted about the fix (despite &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;having a pinned tweet&lt;/a&gt; talking about the bug), but Snap’s SVP of Product &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacobandreou/status/1409640178352680960"&gt;has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the issue being fixed. Both myself and one of my co-workers tested the update, and it fixed the crashing issue for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkbbKz"&gt;If your phone isn’t automatically downloading the update, you can grab it yourself by going to the App Store, tapping on your profile picture in the top right corner, and pulling down to refresh. Any available updates should appear, and you can download them. If you turned off Auto-update to avoid the bugged version, you can turn it back on by going to Settings &amp;gt; App Store, and then toggling App Updates on under Automatic Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj8B3m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 7:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the issue appears to have been fixed by an update from Snapchat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office is getting a new design and a native 64-bit Arm version for Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEkJ-reY6LLBP4_pTD30Sv78aEk=/138x0:1623x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516175/Zoomed_in_view_of_WXP_in_default_theme_in_SV.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Obs61"&gt;&lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/64-bit-office-for-windows-on-arm"&gt;Microsoft is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that the next version of Office for Windows 11 will have a native 64-bit Arm version, for improved performance on large or picture-filled documents, and support for 64-bit add-ins. The new version of Office is currently in beta, available to &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwI8im"&gt;Microsoft also announced &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/visual-refresh-of-office-apps-for-windows"&gt;a redesign of Office&lt;/a&gt;, which you can see above and below. While it uses a similar design to Windows 11, it’ll be available whether you're running the Windows 11 Preview or Windows 10. In addition to the new design, Office will also adapt to your Windows light / dark mode, so you should be able to avoid the experience of opening a document and having it blast light into your eyes at night. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4kSqt3QNq0Dq8uweVBByzgwADc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687533/Excel_and_PPT_in_SV_NEW_1536x864.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newly-designed Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y47sBe"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t shied away from talking about Arm with Windows 11. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc"&gt;contentious list&lt;/a&gt; of supported CPUs &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-qualcomm-processors"&gt;includes a handful of Qualcomm chips&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8vO1inHBb8"&gt;used the Arm-powered Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; to show off the tablet capabilities of its new OS. For those with Arm machines, it’s probably a good sign — having native apps is likely going to be more efficient than emulation, and provide better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnR4gy"&gt;It is, however, perhaps a little awkward that it took so long for a 64-bit Arm version of Office to come to Windows — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;M1 Macs got a native version&lt;/a&gt; late last year. There are also a few features that Microsoft mentions haven't come to the Arm version of Office yet, though that’s to be expected given that it’s currently in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHPshL"&gt;In addition to being in the Office Insider program, those who want to test out 64-bit Office on their Arm Windows machine will also have to be running &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;the Windows 11 Insider Preview&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll also have to uninstall any 32-bit versions of Office they may have installed before reinstalling Office and updating to the beta version. If you’re running the Office beta on either Windows 10 or 11, you should be able to turn the redesign on from the Coming Soon pane in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoftBank has reportedly halted production of its Pepper robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pepper-softbank-robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa6HeT0Ma1wIiEoyx7r7HJet_JQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515973/DSC01589__1_.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hv8v9k"&gt;SoftBank is reportedly restructuring its robotics business and has already halted production of its Pepper robot, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Robotics is just one of many businesses the large Japanese firm has invested in, but potentially permanently ending production of Pepper is notable because of the robot’s role as a sort of unofficial mascot for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8npFxE"&gt;SoftBank plans to lay off 330 staff members based in France, the original home of SoftBank’s robotics efforts, and apparently half of the division’s sales team in the UK and the US, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes. Production of Pepper robots was reportedly halted last year and would be costly to restart, &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources claim. We’ve reached out to SoftBank to confirm the details of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOJY3h"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report follows closely after SoftBank’s sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics to Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly seems like the company is reconsidering what exactly it wants to do in the robot business. For now, that means less futuristic moonshot promises and more practical business-type offerings, like &lt;a href="https://us.softbankrobotics.com/whiz"&gt;a carpet-cleaning robot called Whiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRz8d4"&gt;Pepper was initially pitched as a robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;that could understand human emotion&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced and hasn’t become any more true, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726082/softbank-pepper-ibm-watson-collaboration"&gt;an assist from IBM’s Watson&lt;/a&gt;. SoftBank then pushed its friendly bot into all sorts of odd, if charming scenarios, like working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;as a Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt;, playing docent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/24/17277350/softbank-pepper-the-robot-smithsonian-museum"&gt;at the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, and staffing the company’s stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hJBwGf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A3ZLLGuvQY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=82&amp;amp;start=82" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxYQXo"&gt;Pepper might not have ever lived up to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3ZLLGuvQY&amp;amp;t=82s"&gt;the ads used to sell it&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, but it could be charming. My interactions with the waist-high android are limited, but after hearing about Pepper a lot online, seeing the real deal was kind of a capital-E experience. I had wandered into a crowded SoftBank store in Tokyo and was greeted by Pepper in Japanese with a friendly smile and a little wave. On paper, traditional robot stuff. But in the moment? I would have at least considered whatever prepaid phone plan Pepper was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8gA7W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upqhHa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube wins naming rights for 6,000-seat event venue at Hollywood Park</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD_Ug9S_6q5slF7NqLPqmzwHsOk=/225x0:1635x940/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515360/youtube_theater_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Theater | YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VUAXLp"&gt;Google-owned YouTube will have its name on a new live event venue in Inglewood, California, part of the new Hollywood Park mixed-use development, the &lt;a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/youtube-partners-with-partners-hollywood-park-to-name-performance-venue-youtube-theater/"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube Theater will be a 6,000-seat performance venue, which will host concerts, comedy shows, YouTube creator events, esports competitions, and community shows. Financial terms of the multiyear naming rights deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VqNbr"&gt;The development is the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and part of the same complex as SoFi Stadium — where the Rams and Chargers play — and American Airlines Plaza. Hollywood Park also houses 3,000 apartments, a 300-room hotel, and an 890,000 square-foot retail area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oe7srF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH9RsPGyVzs?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=6&amp;amp;start=6" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVZEy"&gt;“YouTube Theater will drive the uniqueness of YouTube by combining physical, ‘in real life’ events that bring creators and fans together, while simultaneously sharing ​that same event​ experience with our two billion global monthly users through livestreams and VOD content,” YouTube vice president of brand marketing Angela Courtin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sySMu2"&gt;Upcoming performers at the three-story, 227,000-square foot YouTube Theater include Pitbull and Iggy Azalea, Black Pumas, and TLC with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The venue also has a 6,100-square-foot stage and a 3,500-square-foot private club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL9kjG"&gt;The theater will have a large-scale digital YouTube “play” button icon outside the venue, which can turn into an immersive video screen where guests can mirror themselves or view highlights from YouTube creators and artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUo4Gk"&gt;YouTube Theater is set to open for its first events later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMC2y4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nKZVkh"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what caused the problem, but the issue should either resolve itself or it can be fixed by going into settings and requesting an update for your filter lists. In an email, the Adblock Plus support channel confirmed the problem “has already been fixed” without going in depth about what it was. Several &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/o9hfbg/issue_on_many_website_since_a_few_days/h3c49d4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posts on social media&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/commit/9a35decd7429737af9c814bf16cf30caed8f939"&gt;recent change in filtering&lt;/a&gt; that works in other blockers but was interpreted by Adblock Plus to block content tagged as “media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc09Cg"&gt;There’s no public statement available from the Adblock Plus social channels or owners eyeo GmbH, but at least the problem was only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited offers six months of Disney Plus for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1rt2Ej7ZfbLHGeIa4ly9ExSfaU=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515302/download.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1Y4Uh"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited customers can now score several months of Disney Plus for free, and the offer extends to new subscribers as well as existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0YPF"&gt;Amazon announced Monday that existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers in the US and Canada can activate three months of Disney’s streaming service for free through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion"&gt;a new promotion&lt;/a&gt;. New Amazon Music Subscribers, meanwhile, will be able to access six months of Disney Plus through the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0t2Ym"&gt;Amazon’s ad-free music streaming service costs $8 a month or $80 annually after a trial period. It is separate from Prime Music, the music service bundled with an Amazon Prime subscription. But where Prime Music has a catalog of roughly 2 million songs, Amazon Music Unlimited’s library comprises roughly 75 million songs and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAk6dq"&gt;The promotion is not, however, valid for users who already subscribe to Disney Plus. But if you’ve yet to subscribe to Disney’s streaming service, now’s not a bad time. New titles are releasing on the service every week, and the company has said that users can expect 100 new titles from Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and National Geographic to hit the service each year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has become a $1 trillion company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrqSG-nohPSsyEr7S-IBnpGeX6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515217/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLlhqZ"&gt;Facebook has joined the ranks of companies valued over a trillion dollars as of today’s market close. The company’s market cap is sitting at $1.008 trillion &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB"&gt;according to Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, putting it over the mark for the first time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqESF5"&gt;Some of the most notable of Facebook’s divisions are the Facebook site itself, along with Messenger, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. On &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;of US tech companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;that have passed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;the $1 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt; mark, Facebook is the only one founded in the 2000s, making it the newest — as long as you’re counting from the date that Google was started (which was in 1998), instead of Alphabet (which was created 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VCfxd"&gt;The news comes alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;the dismissal of the FTC’s case&lt;/a&gt; to unwind Facebook’s Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, after a federal judge stated that the FTC did not offer enough evidence that the company is a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say farewell to the BMW i3, the kooky electric hatchback that couldn’t quite make it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BMW i3 hero" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvkhGIZAwjCnKaqZxZk-gz5y3M=/2x0:1099x731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514972/BMW16_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7rrZO"&gt;BMW will stop selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/17/5317032/bmw-i3-driving-the-electric-rebel-in-munichs-stable"&gt;the i3 electric hatchback&lt;/a&gt; in the US starting next month. It’s the latest pint-sized vehicle to fall victim to American car buyers’ insatiable appetite for huge, towering, climate-killing trucks and SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuI2kv"&gt;First released in 2013, the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle. Always intended to be more of a city car than anything intended for long trips, the i3 maxed out at 80 miles of range from a 22kWh battery, with a modest 170 horsepower. The battery capacity grew 50 percent — to 33kWh — after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/1/11550026/bmw-i3-2017-electric-vehicle-range-larger-battery"&gt;2017 update&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the range to 113 miles. Thanks to its kooky, futuristic, and polarizing design, it was never a sales juggernaut, but it certainly developed a cult following over time. The i3 was able to carve out a niche in the nascent EV market and, all told, BMW has sold about 100,000 of them globally since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pP25D6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkca7l"&gt;But its relevance was certainly on the wane. &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/06/25/bmw-i3-era-comes-to-an-end-in-the-u-s-this-july/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the i3’s inventory for the US was at its lowest point over the last 12 months, with customers often experiencing difficulties securing a production slot. Last year, only 1,052 i3s were sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cR2Av"&gt;In an email, a spokesperson for BMW confirmed that US production of the i3 will end July 2021. “At the time of its launch in 2013, the BMW i3 represented a pioneering moment in electric vehicles and lightweight construction,” the spokesperson said. “Not only was the BMW i3 of the world’s first purpose-built electric vehicles, but the use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and aluminum in the vehicle’s construction, made it truly unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P07Yha"&gt;The “success” of the i3 has helped lay the groundwork for the imminent release of the BMW iX SUV and i4 sedan, which together represent the tip of the spear in the automaker’s belated effort to recapture its early sales momentum for EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYR4E"&gt;BMW fans were disappointed that the automaker never made successors for the i3 or the plug-in hybrid i8 sports car in the years since those cars were released. But the company is iterating on the underlying electric technology. Now, that next-gen tech will not only power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462746/bmw-ix-suv-ev-price-specs"&gt;the iX SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;the i4 sedan&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279482/bmw-ix3-concept-specs-beijing-motor-show"&gt;the China-made iX3&lt;/a&gt; (which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171762/bmw-ix3-long-range-electric-suv-us-market-china-europe"&gt;not destined for the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZS3Tf"&gt;Of course, the iX and i4 will be more expensive than the i3, which started at around $44,000. The base model i4 will start at $55,400, while the iX is expected to sell for $83,200. Both EVs will go on sale in the US starting in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Oth0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal court dismisses FTC’s bid to unwind Instagram from Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31Q8Uyv6kjS3tSwv5ISFIbxIZdo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514871/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KrJR4W"&gt;On Monday, a US District Court dealt a huge blow to the federal government’s antitrust case against Facebook by &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf"&gt;dismissing a complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed late last year&lt;/a&gt;, sought to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The judge also dismissed an associated case filed by a group of state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4e8WJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0134/facebook-inc-ftc-v"&gt;its initial complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleged that Facebook violated federal antitrust laws by purchasing a would-be competitor in the social media market. But in his decision to dismiss the complaint Monday, Judge James E. Boasberg wrote that the FTC offered insufficient evidence for its central claim — that Facebook wields monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ozLskU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6nPtzD"&gt;“The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims —namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services,” Boasberg wrote. “The complaint contains nothing on that score save the naked allegation that the company has had and still has a ‘dominant share of th[at] market (in excess of 60%).’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8GvgF"&gt;Boasberg also dismissed the claims against Facebook’s interoperability restrictions, finding that the policies were implemented too long ago to be subject to FTC action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caHK8N"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the company’s stock surged in response to the dismissal, clearing $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time in Facebook history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zSp7R"&gt;The ruling also struck down a parallel anti-monopoly case against Facebook filed by a coalition of state attorneys general. Nearly every state attorney general signed onto a lawsuit against Facebook in December, making similar allegations as the FTC case. But Boasberg dismissed that case &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974156-govuscourtsdcd2249231370_1"&gt;in an accompanying decision&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, holding that &lt;a href="https://pivotallawgroup.com/Blog/2019/08/Case-Law-Update-The-Doctrine-of"&gt;a specific civil law doctrine&lt;/a&gt; prevented the coalition from challenging acquisitions settled so many years in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXI0vd"&gt;Notably, Judge Boasberg left room for the FTC to revise its case and unwind past Facebook mergers. The commission has until July 29th to file a new complaint outlining its argument regarding Facebook’s market dominance, and the judge made it clear that the FTC’s case was not affected by the civil doctrine that doomed the state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsoGJD"&gt;“An injunction under Section 13(b) is a theoretically available remedy in a Section 2 challenge to long-ago mergers,” Boasberg wrote in the FTC opinion, “so long as the defendant still holds the purchased assets or stock, as is the case here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXeGo1"&gt;Boasberg also noted the inherent difficulty of establishing monopoly power for a free online service, as the FTC is now required to do. “This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market,” Boasberg’s opinion reads. “Rather, PSN [Personal Social Networking] services are free to use, and the exact metes and bounds of what even constitutes a PSN service — &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, which features of a company’s mobile app or website are included in that definition and which are excluded — are hardly crystal clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqqYvo"&gt;The court’s dismissal could provoke more aggressive action from the legislature, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;Congress is currently pushing forward&lt;/a&gt; on sweeping tech antitrust reforms. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee approved a slate of bills targeting Big Tech’s market power, including bans on large mergers and new interoperability requirements. All six measures are headed to the House floor and parallel bills are expected to be introduced in the Senate over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmgwV6"&gt;“Today’s development in the FTC’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1409594342860283904?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7rfJa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXXbgz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
