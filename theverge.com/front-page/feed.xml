    <title>NYC orders nearly 200 Mustang Mach-Es for police and first responders</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojOKDk"&gt;On Wednesday, New York City announced it has &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcas/news/21-020/nyc-taking-another-step-towards-achieving-all-electric-municipal-fleet"&gt;ordered 184 fully electric Ford Mustang Mach-Es&lt;/a&gt; for use by law enforcement and emergency response workers. The vehicles are set to be delivered by June 2022, as part of an $11.5 million contract that will remain in place for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uudz0v"&gt;The city said the Mach-Es would be used by the New York Police Department, New York City’s Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Correction, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Protection, and other emergency management and response departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0m7YJ"&gt;New York City plans to buy over 1,250 electric vehicles in 2022, transitioning all law enforcement vehicles to electric ones by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cM5DuJ"&gt;“Law enforcement vehicles are the largest and most visible part of our City’s fleet,” Keith Kerman, NYC chief fleet officer, said in a Wednesday statement. “This order of all-electric Mach-Es will enable our law enforcement agencies to put electric models to the full test and work out maintenance, lights and sirens, charging, and other operational issues. It is a critical step towards our goal of a fully electric fleet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FM07e8"&gt;This year was set to be a huge year for EVs, but many automakers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;struggled to scale production&lt;/a&gt;. The Mach-E had its own shaky rollout in March, and Ford was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;delay deliveries to some 4,500 customers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSTU90"&gt;New York’s order is part of a broader push to integrate electric vehicles into government fleets. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden said that his administration&lt;/a&gt; would work to phase out the government’s use of gas-powered vehicles in its fleet of more than 600,00 vehicles. Earlier this year, President Biden signed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;a historic $1 trillion infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; that invested billions into building a network of electric vehicle chargers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udluij"&gt;“Every single City vehicle we electrify is one step forward to advance clean air and a climate-friendly New York City,” said Ben Furnas, head of the mayor’s office on climate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has PS5 consoles in stock again (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHT6HC-tzg2h98Zs1DFGPSG3poA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330579/vpavic_4261_20201023_0040.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDNL5b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 11:48AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; And it appears that due to an astounding lack of defenses against bots, Amazon is already sold out, again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1BIer"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PlayStation 5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DFCB66S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has PS5 consoles in stock right now&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5hDPX"&gt;The consoles are only available for Amazon Prime subscribers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;continuing a trend of retailers restricting access to consoles for paying subscribers only&lt;/a&gt;. If you can’t add it to your cart, keep trying — occasionally the sites restock over a period of a few minutes. We will update this post once Amazon confirms it’s out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Also, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to have the latest tech deals delivered right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PS5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I refuse to care about the quality of my webcam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ0UutWQ8xJY9TRNsjhP6evJijI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330489/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will not do this.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxRWfX"&gt;I am the very person who should care about my appearance on Zoom calls. I don’t mean the state of my hair or appearance of hormonal acne on my face. I’m talking image quality. Focal length. &lt;em&gt;Bokeh. &lt;/em&gt;I have written about and reviewed cameras and smartphones for over a decade. I use videoconferencing platforms throughout my work day. I own a nice camera that I could connect to my laptop and use for Zoom meetings. But I won’t, and I simply do not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekE4Xe"&gt;I know how much more flattering a longer focal length would be than my MacBook Air’s built-in wide-angle lens. I have the tools, the knowledge, and the power to employ a softly blurred background behind me. If I did, maybe I’d command more respect in meetings. My colleagues might scroll through a sea of thumbnails on our staff meeting Zoom and, seeing the sheer professionalism that my image exudes, would think to themselves, “Man, Allison really has her shit together.” Instead, they see the grainy image of a person who has clearly not gotten enough sleep and a cluttered, disgustingly in-focus background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CRd9jy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have the tools, the knowledge, and the power to employ a softly blurred background behind me&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ha5BGh"&gt;I wish I could blame my apathy on lockdown fatigue. We’re entering year three of this virus; at this point the pandemic has had more false endings than &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;. There are too many real things to care about, I could argue, like variants and case numbers. But I know in my heart of hearts I still wouldn’t care even if I could reclaim the emotional energy I spend each day worrying about whether the public space I’m in is properly ventilated. I’m just not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgrlQE"&gt;Many of my co-workers do use their nice cameras on video calls, with special tripods and flattering lighting to boot. They look amazing! I applaud their efforts! And for them, I think it’s about more than just looking a little fancy on a Zoom meeting. It’s the product of the shared trait that unites all of us nerds: the inclination to tinker with things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFf1tD"&gt;There are things I enjoy tinkering with, and there are things I don’t. I use the built-in speakers on my TV and the built-in grinder on my espresso machine; audio nerds and espresso nerds would find this horrifying. On the other hand, I spent a significant portion of the summer of 2020 turning my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island into &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fbT3RjfxTdA5Dy9uPxI2fQs3Mj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132766/chaos.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was a real labor of love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7Z57f"&gt;Many reasonable people would consider that to be a poor use of time. To me, it was prime tinkering. I’m indifferent to tinkering with my webcam, but I’ll happily tinker with some pixel art to make sure I get the “Danger: 10,000 volts” sign just right on the &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex &lt;/em&gt;paddock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggSgBG"&gt;So, my fellow nerds, tinker away — whether it’s your fancy webcam, the PC you built from spare parts lying around your apartment, or the perfect espresso grind. I’ll be over here looking like a videoconferencing amateur, but you can bet my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island is immaculate. We’re all going to need our projects to keep tinkering with — it looks like we’re not leaving home in 2022, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zswq49"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8h1hU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink: BMW cancels media events and Mercedes is out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.” The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txgm6L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google: “we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;Chipmaking giant Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19'"&gt;said on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt; that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.” Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it’s pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GlLye"&gt;The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, but now that has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr5Yi4"&gt;A statement from the company says, “We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHR3zT"&gt;GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1474130973923033117"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyortL"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, “After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUKJbt"&gt;With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-cancels-ces-2022-attendance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it issued the following statement: “AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsNQ3"&gt;Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948"&gt;says in a post on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgEruz"&gt;OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quKYwk"&gt;As of Thursday, December 30th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes are either entirely out or have reduced their in-person presence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq0giq"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;The day after that, the CTA said it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykL0Nr"&gt;As far as why “CES will and must go on,” CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “ CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:56AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8vEK5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Waymo and Intel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN1hMh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from GM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BIkhx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 4:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmmdZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 5:24PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note MSI, AMD, and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, added information from the op-ed written by CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAXUHr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 9:22AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sC9UaK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 30th, 11:03AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said BMW and Panasonic are out of CES. In fact they will both have physical booths at the show, but have changed to virtual media events. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpZH7F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says its foldable shipments increased four-fold in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0P53WWZ6Sz44CitacAYXh7fssA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330329/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0pazt"&gt;Samsung wants you to know its foldables haven’t flopped. In a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/a-decade-in-the-making-how-samsung-foldables-are-defining-the-future-of-smartphone-innovation"&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it sold four times more foldable devices in 2021 than 2020. It attributes this success to the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, which, in our own reviews, we hailed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;step toward mainstream usability&lt;/a&gt; thanks to their refined designs and lower prices. Samsung says sales for these two devices in their first month alone exceeded “total accumulative sales of Samsung foldable devices in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79fSs0"&gt;These are promising metrics for the slow ascension of foldable phones, though you should bear in mind that Samsung isn’t sharing hard sales data. Instead, it pointed to the fact that its increases were greater than predictions made by third-party analysts, who suggested  that total shipments from all manufacturers for foldable devices would hit &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/ko/foldable-smartphone-shipments-2023/"&gt;9 million in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbb8o4"&gt;If Samsung thinks this figure is useful enough to cite — and with the company thought to account for around 88 percent of the total foldable markets — we can guess that its sales were in the high single-digit millions or pushing into the low tens of millions. These numbers are expected to increase tenfold by 2023, with Samsung taking a smaller slice of the market as rival manufacturers like Oppo and Huawei join the foldable fun. Also predicted by some for 2023: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;foldable iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, which would really boost the segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avYseV"&gt;Samsung also says that its decision to push forward early with foldable devices has paid off in terms of converting customers. It says that “compared to the Galaxy Note 20, Samsung has seen a 150 percent increase in consumers who switched smartphone brands for the Galaxy Z Flip 3.” If you want to attract new money, it helps to offer something unique.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>12 great apps ready for your new 2021 Mac </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hl-k061DcpSRSb5eQp45aCJ16eU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330299/RoundUpArt_MacApps.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Make your Mac more useful and easier to use&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6hVfKX"&gt;With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;fancy new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;colorful new iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;2020’s still-excellent M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; all offering incredible performance and battery life, it’s never been a better time to give (or receive) a new Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2N023u"&gt;And as more and more people are shifting to remote work, that laptop or computer you buy has to do more than ever. So we’ve rounded up some of our favorite Mac apps, designed to help you be more productive or to simply just make using your computer and navigating day-to-day life and Zoom calls a little more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vfrK0I"&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixelmator Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wm85YudeA9bT8DVnGco58KaEA-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075769/Pixelmator_Pro_2.3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Pixelmator Team&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fh8os"&gt;Adobe Photoshop is a key tool for image and photo editing, but it’s super expensive, thanks to its monthly $9.99 subscription. Pixelmator Pro, on the other hand, has a one-time fee of $19.99 while still offering tons of powerful tools for editing your photos. The latest update added a host of useful new features, including the ability to instantly remove the background from an image and improved masking and selection tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8MhEd1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925828" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CCgQZ8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DIPd8P"&gt;Spark&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Spark" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oE0kpfUvlQk5N0VGYKQJYnwKfr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075780/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.19.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Readdle Technologies&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsVprW"&gt;Spark is one of my favorite email apps for mobile, and the company’s Mac app is just as great, offering a fast UI, helpful automated sorting, and tons of customization for power users. And it supports Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, Exchange, and more, along with integrations for popular work services like Trello, Asana, Zoom, and GoToMeeting. No one likes having to deal with email, but Spark makes it a little easier to get it done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A1Yu2A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925844" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TkfmNn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bjYpOF"&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gl-HeGv2HhwGyw0t7M0uf6vNgKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075785/tweetbot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKu7Ps"&gt;Twitter’s official app exists and is free, but Tweetbot is infinitely better if you’re the kind of person that spends a lot of time on Twitter. The paid app has no ads or suggested tweets clogging up your timeline — instead, it just offers the revolutionary feature of showing all the tweets from the people you follow in the chronological order that they tweeted it. The app looks great, too, with a clean, simple interface that makes reading Twitter &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nb64CE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925866" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0eW9lR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ot4Wq5"&gt;Alfred 4 for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alfred 4 for Mac" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5_knYjl45pEuwzRgScCArjECRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075793/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.24.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Crayons&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alfred 4 for Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EPijo8"&gt;Like many apps on this list, Alfred does something that one of Apple’s built-in apps already does — in this case, search your computer. But Alfred is way better: a lightning-fast search tool and app launcher that supports virtually endless customization, including automated workflows, bespoke Google searches, or whatever else you can think of. Once you use it for a few days, you’ll never be able to go back to Spotlight again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gSGC9M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925913" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UZteYP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GtA7Iv"&gt;DaisyDisk&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fOkL92"&gt;It happens to everyone sooner or later: after a few years of accumulating photos, videos, music, and other random documents, you start to get the dreaded notifications that you’re running out of room on your hard drive. DaisyDisk is meant to help — it scans your computer and shows you just how much storage you’re using, broken down by files and folders in neat, colorful rings that make it simple to dial down to the junk that’s taking up all your space and clear out your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fnu9Pm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925922" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MLgOA5"&gt;Your passwords probably aren’t secure enough. 1Password will help you fix that, generating ultra-secure passwords and keeping track of everything. With deep integration into both Safari and Chrome, a clean UI, and tons of useful added features for protecting not just passwords but credit cards, documents, and more, it’s a one-stop shop for securing your digital life. An individual subscription is $36 per year, but if you have more than one person in your household, you’re probably better off with the five-person family subscription for $60 per year that adds the option to share passwords, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3pXcpl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925931" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="de49OW"&gt;If you’re not using two-factor authentication for your important passwords and log-ins, go do that now. Authy is one of the better apps around for your two-factor setup, with cross-platform apps on iOS and Android. The Mac app does exactly what the mobile versions do: it gets you your 2FA codes when you need to log in. But it’s far more helpful, due to its being on the computer that you’re probably trying to log into something on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EODa1X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925997" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Iq0vE5"&gt;MonitorControl&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MonitorControl" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLwOpR6A5cY2GJqReY3yv0dmxy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075805/monitorcontrol.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MonitorControl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FFJSrx"&gt;As more people shift towards working remotely, there’s been a big uptick in building out home offices and using an external monitor. MonitorControl is a nifty little menubar app that lets you control your external display’s brightness and volume (if it has built-in speakers) using your Mac’s function keys, just like on Apple’s own hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mGipeQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926032" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CEfEHe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pkQL0p"&gt;Hand Mirror&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hand Mirror" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0jLQZGXwyMO51d9mLp2AZ2txr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075806/screenshot.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g4USze"&gt;Video calls are a bigger part of the day-to-day workplace than ever before. Hand Mirror is a simple app that lives in your Mac’s menubar and is designed to help you look your best on calls: a single click, and it launches a quick window that shows what the current view from your webcam is, letting you double-check that you’ve moved all the workout gear or messy laundry from your background or that your hair is neat &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you start your Zoom call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMUKwT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926063" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yDs0WP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nsSZH"&gt;Dozer&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dozer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h7LJkwWAiNLzYc3rESNRkNKNnEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075812/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.29.40_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dozer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CqH7Wm"&gt;Managing your menubar apps can get out of hand pretty quickly (especially if you just installed any of the ones that we’re recommending here). And it’s only become a bigger problem thanks to Apple’s new MacBook Pro models, which eat up a big chunk of your menubar real estate with a hefty webcam notch. Well, Dozer is here to help. It’s a free app that makes it easy to hide all the menubar icons for things you want open but don’t necessarily need to have visible all the time. If you prefer a little more flash, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 but offers a fancier design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKFbZY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926073" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KshH7i"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="krM9gS"&gt;Meeter&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Meeter" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HEnoof2Wt5xJuUFAvqdtw0R-A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075813/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.30.14_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meeter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i37pxV"&gt;Meeter is another menubar app that’s designed to help with one thing: wrangling all your different Zoom, Google Meet, Webex, Teams, and other video calls into a single place, with one-click links to join whatever meetings you have scheduled. The free app links to your Mac’s built-in Calendar app and can pull in any video calls it sees, putting them in a handy drop-down menu, complete with notifications to remind you to join before your call starts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QzA7h3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926082" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ckQL93"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMs2Ku"&gt;VLC&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VLC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9APnc3iWS_MKLu1j85WfB2kYh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075815/EsCB_03XIAgjW_T.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VideoLan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VLC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F35vNm"&gt;Local media playback isn’t the critical function it once was, thanks to the rise of streaming as the main way of consuming movies, TV shows, and music. But for those times that you do need to play a local audio or video file, there’s still no better app than VLC, which can handle virtually any file format or codec you’ve ever heard of and quite a few that you haven’t. Plus, it’s completely free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sKd9fj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925589" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1ZbhMa"&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes to skip planned in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany on January 5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfckIt"&gt;While it’s a late scratch compared to some other announcements, it’s not the only featured exhibitor recently announcing a change of plans, as IBM said it will forgo in-person appearances. In a statement, an IBM spokesperson says, “Due to the evolving COVID conditions - and out of an abundance of caution - IBM has recently decided not to participate on-site in Las Vegas this year. We do still look forward to participating virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTeSB"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that fellow German automaker Mercedes-Benz is going to skip the in-person event as well, while &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says Panasonic, which usually has a massive central hall booth, is shifting to a virtual showing but with “limited on-site staffing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N96vro"&gt;In a statement, Panasonic North America CEO Megan Myungwon Lee says, “The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers remains our top priority. With this commitment in mind, we have updated our hybrid CES activation plans maintaining a modified physical footprint, with limited on-site staff, following CTA’s health safety protocols as well as our own proactive measures to ensure the health and well-being of attendees. We have shifted our press conference to a fully-virtual platform and will continue with our plan to deliver a seamless, virtual experience highlighting our newest technology products, solutions and innovations across Sustainable Energy, Smart Mobility, Immersive Experiences, Food Tech Solutions, Lifestyle Technologies and Healthy Environments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u0NUAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wfe0FL"&gt;Some companies had already reduced their presence at the show over safety concerns. Over the last few years, BMW has had a significant showing at CES in recent years, demonstrating cars around the outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center while also showcasing innovative demos inside, like at the last pre-pandemic show in 2020 where attendees could customize their own concept car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjwSg"&gt;This year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43494/bmw-will-show-car-paint-that-changes-color-with-the-touch-of-a-button-at-ces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports BMW said it would have a car with color-changing paint, while &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/12/15/bmw-theater-screen-ces-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we should also expect to see a new Theater Screen that “really gives an immersive, cinematic experience in the vehicle” that could launch in high-end models like the 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuXmmH"&gt;Mercedes will continue with &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-bb71195b68ec7523e1b4dfa8cc0e738b-digital-world-premiere-of-the-vision-eqxx-the-most-efficient-mercedes-benz-ever"&gt;an all-digital premiere of its new Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says is “the most efficient vehicle the brand has ever built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20hoUH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nE3F6H"&gt;As of Thursday, LG, Sony, and Samsung told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were still planning to attend in person. CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBIgSb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 10:26AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that BMW and Panasonic will maintain a presence on the show floor, and added statement from Panasonic North America CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Theranos failed, but other researchers might not</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ug967aRZaF48U4qyb7CriMrScaQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330156/ep2_v12_notext.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljdqhx"&gt;Jurors are still deliberating over the fate of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of defunct biotech company Theranos. They’re deciding if she intentionally misled investors, patients, and doctors about what her company’s blood testing technology could do. Because despite big promises, the tech the company claimed to have invented... didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCZgub"&gt;And the technology might &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be a reality — at least not in the way Holmes described it. In this episode of our three-part series on Theranos, we look at what researchers actually think is possible in the field of blood testing and what the future could look like.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla recalls nearly half a million Model 3 and Model S cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM6CgRRzS6zGu_Q_oaqOqcfhJJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330039/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O7CdKE"&gt;Tesla has issued voluntary recalls for nearly half a million vehicles to address potential failures in its trunk latching systems, &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-recall-models-trunk-crash-issues-51640868026?tesla=y"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Barron’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The recalls apply to &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/RWD#recalls"&gt;all Model 3 units&lt;/a&gt; released between 2017 and 2020, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2015/TESLA/MODEL%252520S%25252070D/5%252520HB/AWD#recalls"&gt;certain Model S units&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUoHyZ"&gt;For the Model 3, Tesla believes the opening and closing of the trunk could damage the cable harness attaching the rearview camera, causing the camera to unexpectedly fail. The Model S issue is more serious, potentially preventing the front trunk from fully latching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibkiQh"&gt;According to documents submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are 475,318 vehicles subject to the recall, comprising 356,309 Model 3 vehicles and 119,109 Model S vehicles. Tesla estimates that only 1 percent of the Model 3 vehicles will actually display the defect, compared to 14 percent of the recalled Model S vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFOGCq"&gt;The Model S recall is particularly concerning because the issue affects the front trunk, which could obstruct the driver’s view of the road if it flies open while driving. In the affected Model S cars, “the front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging,” Tesla told NHTSA in an official filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCXZEs"&gt;Since the Model S problem is a misalignment rather than a damaged component, Tesla believes that repositioning the latch device at a service center will resolve the issue. For affected Model 3 owners, Tesla has pledged to install a new cable harness and guide protector free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s photo-focused Xperia 1 III is down to its best price yet</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjDaKo"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 1 III has a few things that other flagship phones don’t, including a near-4K, 120Hz OLED display, along with plenty of high-quality manual photo and video controls, dual front-facing speakers, and a headphone jack. And yet, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; it — mostly due to its high $1,300 cost. Though, today’s deal on the phone makes the price just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;more digestible. For only the second time since it launched during the summer, Sony’s unlocked Xperia 1 III smartphone has returned to its all-time low price of $1,198 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xperia-III-Smartphone-6-5-21/dp/B091YC2SJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsox1m3.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeSonyExperia1III123021"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5b51"&gt;For context, that’s around the same price as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; and even cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent storage capacity. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjekA7kR3O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has the smartphone on sale for $1,199.99, yet the retailer is also throwing in a free Microsoft 365 trial and a 50 percent discount on an Ultra Mobile SIM kit, if those things matter to you. For those impressed enough by the promise of the phone’s screen and its excellent photo and video-shooting capabilities, this could be a great chance to snag the device before the price goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8EWbh0"&gt;Lenovo’s excellent Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop is selling at a great price over at Antonline. While it costs around &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-7-16GB-RAM-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-512GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Gray-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals123021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,850 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (it’s rarely in stock for its $1,530 MSRP, unfortunately), &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Lenovo/Computers/Computer_Systems/Notebooks/1436996" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $1,489.99 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, and the value is tough to beat for this price. This model has a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display at QHD Plus resolution, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip (with a total graphics power of 130W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Basically, it’s a stacked machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; this laptop in 2021, praising its performance and specs for the price. He even went as far as to refer to it as “Lenovo’s best gaming laptop yet.” The Legion 5 Pro also impressed with its typing experience and the amount of ports available. It’s tough to find a laptop that’s this powerful for under $1,800. For context, it’s about as capable as Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8XEemS"&gt;Looking to warm up your home while saving a bit of money on heating costs? Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQT85FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the Ecobee SmartThermostat for $199&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), matching its Black Friday price. The smart thermostat features a touchscreen display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; was more responsive and easier to navigate than the one on its predecessor. It also supports voice controls and flexible scheduling, and it includes an external temperature sensor that will help maintain comfort in remote rooms. This smart thermostat offers support for HomeKit and Siri and is also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, and SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6TBezw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCqQ3a"&gt;One of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best SSDs compatible with the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; recently dropped to its lowest price to date. Normally $229.99, B&amp;amp;H Photo is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1593680-REG%2Fsamsung_mz_v8p1t0b_am_1tb_980_pro_pcie.html%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F30%2F22858521%2Fsony-xperia-1-iii-smartphone-apple-airpods-max-ecobee-smart-thermostat-samsung-980-pro-ssd-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s lightning-quick 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD for $149.99&lt;/a&gt; (discount applies at checkout). That’s $80 off one of the few drives out there that meets Sony’s performance requirements for its latest console, assuming you have a heatsink like &lt;a href="https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-m-2-nvme-heatsink-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EKWB’s EK-M2 NVMe&lt;/a&gt; to pair with it. This M.2 SSD also works with PC, but you need to have a compatible motherboard to enjoy its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds. Otherwise, it’ll still work but at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8LQq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXP5LD"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to headphones, you still have four days left to snag a set of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 for their lowest price to date. Regularly $149.99, Woot is selling the true wireless earbuds — which come with support for active noise cancellation — for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealRoundup122921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt; through January 3rd. Note, however, that these don’t come with Samsung’s one-year warranty but rather a 90-day warranty through Woot. Think twice about this. We’ve seen the price at other retailers dipping down to around $110, but Woot’s deal might be the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMhK4"&gt;After reviewing them, my colleague Chris Welch was impressed by their audio quality as well as their small, discreet design. In fact, these wireless earbuds are easily some of Samsung’s smallest and lightest yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96Zafn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jBFpoG"&gt;Some other good deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PlZUg3"&gt;If you need a new power adapter, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy Apple’s official 20W USB-C adapter for $15.69&lt;/a&gt; instead of $19 at Amazon, its lowest price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zUwfxE"&gt;A few of Oculus’ must-have accessories for the Quest 2 headset are still discounted, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap at $39&lt;/a&gt; (usually $49) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard zip-up case for $39&lt;/a&gt; (also normally $49).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IISEE3"&gt;You can reserve a pair of the AirPods Max at Micro Center &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/632264/apple-airpods-max-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-space-gray" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re currently only available for in-store pickup in select regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6rWSSG"&gt;Amazon is discounting the Eve Energy Strip, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Energy-Strip-overvoltage-overcurrent/dp/B07PX57RH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling it for an all-time low of $79.96&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. The Eve Energy Strip makes it easy to independently control three power outlets via Siri, an app, or using a handful of other devices while at home or away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peXUTj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjfrEqT5DB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling Razer’s Basilisk v2 wired gaming mouse for $34.99 instead of $79.99. The latter is also offering a $10 discount on Microsoft’s PC Game Pass with your purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
