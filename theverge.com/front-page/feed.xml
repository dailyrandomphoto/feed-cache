    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RHCSff"&gt;Comcast’s X1 platform has slowly added apps to its library over the years, and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call"&gt;this morning on the company’s earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Brian Roberts announced that the Apple TV app would join the roster soon, while Comcast’s Xfinity Stream app will launch on Apple TV devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zg5NjK"&gt;Comcast’s tech platform, which already has apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593310/netflix-4k-comcast-xfinity-x1-users-stranger-things-house-cards"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17645152/comcast-amazon-prime-video-xfinity-x1-box"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube, and Disney+ in the US, isn’t just on its cable boxes anymore. It underpins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18276040/comcast-flex-streaming-announced-features-pricing"&gt;Xfinity Flex&lt;/a&gt; streaming platform, the XiOne streaming set-top box, and new &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-xclass-tv-powered-by-global-entertainment-platforms"&gt;XClass 4K TVs&lt;/a&gt; that recently launched from Hisense. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="XClass 4K TV" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK9B-cvClKWfgrY-QnxrxCX-qLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962772/corporate_xclass_tv_inline_yellowstone_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comcast&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;XClass 4K TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vkkY59"&gt;Two models of the TV are available, in 43- and 50-inch sizes, for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHisense-43-inch-XClass-4K-UHD-A6-Series-Smart-TV-43A6GX%2F357811284&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$298&lt;/a&gt; and $348, respectively. Like other smart TVs in their price range — and other devices on Comcast’s platform — they have streaming apps, Dolby Vision HDR, and voice search remotes. They also include a one-year subscription to Comcast’s Peacock Premium streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNHK0"&gt;As Comcast tries to sell its tech on devices worldwide (in the UK and other European markets, it’s pushing a &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/introducing-sky-glass-streaming-tv-from-sky"&gt;Sky Glass TV&lt;/a&gt; with the same basic platform), then including access to Apple TV Plus is simply a requirement to compete. Getting its app on Apple TV is a bonus as cord-cutting proceeds to shrink its base of customers with cable TV service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making this album with AI ‘felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RkJAo7DnkTwHw2dBpJZDiDTjsng=/0x354:3000x2354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056810/cotton_modules_shadow_planet_cover_3000x3000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Shadow Planet’ was made by Robin Sloan and Jesse Solomon Clark, aka The Cotton Modules, using OpenAI’s Jukebox AI music model. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQKKYp"&gt;The scare is over and the fun can begin. That’s how I tend to think of creative endeavors involving artificial intelligence these days. We’ve moved past, I think, hyperbolic claims about AI making human art redundant and can now enjoy all the possibilities this technology affords. In that light, &lt;a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a new album made as a three-way collaboration between two humans and AI — shows exactly what sort fun can be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXnnFM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; is the creation of writer &lt;a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/"&gt;Robin Sloan&lt;/a&gt;, musician &lt;a href="https://www.agentsdelfuturo.com/"&gt;Jesse Solomon Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt;, a machine learning music program made by OpenAI. After an off-the-cuff Instagram conversation between Sloan and Clark about starting a band (named The Cotton Modules), the two began exchanging tapes of music. A seasoned composer, Clark sent seeds of songs to Sloan who fed them into Jukebox, which is trained on a huge dataset of 1.2 million songs and tries to autocomplete any audio it hears. The AI program, steered by Sloan, then built on Clark’s ideas, which Sloan sent back to him to develop further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="du2TCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenAI’s Jukebox model is trained on 1.2 million songs to produce its own music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6Phqr"&gt;The end result of this three-way trade is &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt;, an atmospheric album in which snippets of folk songs and electronic hooks emerge like moss-covered logs from a fuzzy bog of ambient loops and disintegrating samples. It is a complete album in and of itself: a pocket musical universe to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAGyxi"&gt;As Sloan explained to me in an interview over email, the sound of &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; is in many ways a result of the limitations of Jukebox, which only outputs mono audio at 44.1kHz. “Making this album, I learned that this kind of AI model is absolutely an ‘instrument’ you need to learn to play,” he told me. “It’s basically a tuba! A very… strange… and powerful… tuba…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMQTz5"&gt;It’s this sort of emergent creativity, when machines and humans respond to limitations and advantages in one another’s programming, that makes AI art so interesting. Think about how the evolution of the harpsichord to the piano affected styles of music, for example, and as the ability of the latter to play loudly or softly (rather than the single fixed dynamic of the harpsichord) engendered new musical genres. This, I think, is what’s happening now with a whole range of AI models that are shaping creative output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpPd5Q"&gt;You can read my interview with Sloan below, and find out why working with machine learning felt to him “like wandering in an enormous labyrinth.” And you can listen to &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2w3ncCMwS9sP5tBayVBWbI?si=gFwAWVAwS8K3nYmnD8bpeA"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.co/3mguKhq"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.co/3mguKhq"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cottonmodules.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, or on Sloan and Clark’s &lt;a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8sseL"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2w3ncCMwS9sP5tBayVBWbI?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W9Opn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEV7ZD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hegcc9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey Robin, thanks for taking the time to speak to me about this album. First of all, tell me a little bit please about what material Jesse was sending you to start this collaboration? Was it original songs? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKDHEQ"&gt;Yes! Jesse is a composer for commercials, films, and physical installations — he wrote the generative soundtrack that runs inside the visitor center at Amazon’s Spheres in Seattle, yikes. So he’s well-accustomed to sitting down and producing a bunch of musical options. Each tape I received from him had around a dozen small “songlets” on it, some only 20-30 seconds long, others a few minutes, all different, all separated by a bit of silence. So, my first task was always to listen through, decide what I liked best, and copy that to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLUHU5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then you fed those into an AI system. Can you tell me a little bit about that program? What was it and how does it work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP4UDM"&gt;I used OpenAI’s Jukebox model, which they trained on ~1.2 million songs, 600K of them in English; it operates on raw audio samples. That’s a huge part of the appeal for me; I find the MIDI-centric AI systems too… polite? They respect the grid too much! The sample-based systems (which I’ve used before, in different incarnations, including &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.mcdbooks.com_features_sourdough&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=PP6-LTvRn3fOxO6seMWTQKOHEIiDwuZlSodM6UESPxA&amp;amp;m=rR_nZk_IWLfn3yt-3mshPh6aEztBNTY8Of0nEtDvT9Q&amp;amp;s=72alzV9crnmJFuLo7r_J6ZqTfedMGOrP5mcM02h0Q6U&amp;amp;e="&gt;to make music for the audiobook of my last novel&lt;/a&gt;) are crunchier and more volatile, so I like them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaimlf"&gt;To sample the Jukebox model, I used my own customized code. The technique OpenAI describes in their publication is very much like, “Hey, Jukebox, play me a song that sounds like The Beatles,” but I wanted to be able to “weird it up,” so my sampling code allows me to specify many different artists and genres and interpolate between them, even if they don’t have anything in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZyQWAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was, to be honest, an extremely slow and annoying process”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPmPdi"&gt;And that’s all just the setup. The sampling process itself is interactive. I’d always start with a “seed” from one of Jesse’s tapes, which would give the model a direction, a vibe to follow. In essence, I’d say to the model: “I’d like something that’s a mix of genre X and Y, sort of like artists A and B, but also, it’s got to follow this introduction: &amp;lt;Jesse’s music plays&amp;gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLg6fy"&gt;I’d also, in some cases, specify lyrics. Then, I would go about eight to 10 seconds at a time, generating three options at each step — the computer churns for five to 10 minutes, FUN — then play them back, select one, and continue ahead… or sometimes reject all three and start over. In the end, I’d have a sample between 60-90 seconds long, and I’d print that to tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvVpvx"&gt;It was, to be honest, an extremely slow and annoying process, but the results were so interesting and evocative that I was always motivated to keep going!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNzGKAu1VgKylkNFlF6HILwkeNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962443/the_cotton_modules_photo_credit_Dafna_Kory_3600px.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yebKAV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did Jesse think about the material you were sending him? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRXUSO"&gt;He underscores that working with the material was often VERY difficult. Weird instruments would rise up out of nowhere, or the key would change in a strange way, etc. But I think that was part of the fun, too, and the reason to do this project at all: each sample I sent him was a puzzle to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl3dM6"&gt;Ultimately, his work was both responsive — “how do I support this sample, help it shine” — and transformative — “what kind of song should this be?” That’s evident on all the songs, but a clear example is “Magnet Train,” where Jesse took pains to showcase and support the vocal performance (weird and dorky and great) and then extended it with elements that suggest “train-ness” — the chugging percussion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgZCnP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how exactly did you hone in on this particular sound, do you think? What pushed you in this direction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id0dmH"&gt;Oh, it was definitely the grain of the medium. Early on, I told Jesse that although the model could produce sound at 44.1kHz, it was only in mono. His response was: “Cool! Let’s use mono cassettes then.” And the music he sent back to me was mono, as well. In his final production pass, he added a bit of stereo width, just so the songs weren’t all totally locked in the center, but it’s a pretty “narrow” album generally, and that’s totally because of the AI’s limitation, which we decided to embrace and extend rather than fight. Same goes for the lo-fi, grainy, “radio tuned to a ghost channel” sound — totally an artifact of the way the model produces music, which we amplified further by bouncing the music to tape so many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XAlVPC"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2H61s7xW1IxjWnmiuT0Xzl?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xog9Ly"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjPleW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in the finished songs that we’re hearing, what proportion of the music is made by AI and what by human? Is it even possible to make that distinction? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Tyrp"&gt;It really does vary widely from song to song, and the truth is, in some cases, we lost track! I’d start with a phrase from Jesse, put it through my sampling process, send it back to him, he’d add a layer or extend it, send it back to me, I’d put it BACK through the sampling process… what’s the human / AI breakdown there? It’s all sort of mixed and layered together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBHdMF"&gt;There’s one division that’s clear: anytime you hear anything that sounds like a human voice, whether it’s enunciating lyrics clearly or sort of ooh-ing and ahh-ing, that voice is generated by the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="well9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this kind of AI model is absolutely an ‘instrument’ you need to learn to play”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ipPHp9"&gt;Making this album, I learned that this kind of AI model is absolutely an “instrument” you need to learn to play. And I’ve come to believe that analogy is a lot more useful and generative than like, “AI co-composer” or “automatic AI artist” or whatever other analogy you might have heard or can imagine. It’s basically a tuba! A very… strange… and powerful… tuba…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3VvLm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haha, right! I’ve spoken to quite a few artists who use machine learning models to make songs or books, and they often talk about the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; between them and the AI — whether it was pushing them in a given direction, for example. Did it feel like this for you at all, when you were exploring what music Jukebox could give you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5TbUn"&gt;I love this question, and here’s why: previously, I have been pretty skeptical / critical of the “big [AI] models trained on everything,” even as they’ve risen to prominence. This is a class that includes GPT-3, Jukebox, CLIP, VQGAN, etc. It’s very clear that this approach produces powerful results, but I always thought it was more creatively interesting to take responsibility for your own dataset, understand its composition as a key creative decision, etc. And I still think that’s true, to a degree…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AupVjT"&gt;BUT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I7S27E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it has felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth or a dead city”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L31cnq"&gt;The experience of using Jukebox really turned me around on this. For me, it has felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth or a dead city: huge, full of alleys and arcades. Even now, having used it for so long, I have no idea what’s still waiting in there, what can be found and carried out. Obviously, I’m betraying the fact that I’ve played too many RPGs here… but truly! That’s the feeling, and it’s VERY fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIo7Xi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that in mind, then, what do you think making this album with Jesse taught you about the future of AI and creativity? What do you think these systems will be doing in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzcvSd"&gt;AI techniques can do a whole bunch of different things for different kinds of artists, of course, but regarding this specific category, the generative model that can produce new music, new sounds. It seems TOTALLY clear to me that these are on the path to becoming a new kind of synthesizer or electric guitar. I think the story will be broadly similar — they’ll go from research project to novelty (which is where we’re at now) to tools for nascent virtuosos (it’s exciting to think about getting to that point!) to commonplace participants in any / every studio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OLED Switch’s new kickstand was made for Mario Party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU44yN73PgKc_Pcb0UNS_TC-1m0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056808/Characters_group_shot_NOA_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImSsAa"&gt;One of the core promises of the Nintendo Switch — the ability to easily play multiplayer games on the go — has long been undone by a flimsy piece of plastic. While the original Switch model technically made it possible to whip out the tablet for some impromptu &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, the terrible kickstand made this impractical at best and dangerous (for your Switch’s screen) at worst. The latest iteration of the hardware finally fixes that —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt; along with the showcase feature, a much-improved OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; — and makes the dream of spontaneous &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; tournaments a reality, at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgZ7mF"&gt;This week Nintendo is releasing &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, a sort of greatest hits collection for the digital board game series. It includes boards from the early Nintendo 64 games, alongside more than 100 mini-games pulled from both N64 and GameCube entries in the series. It’s a pretty solid collection, with some familiar favorites — along with some, let’s say, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22745502/mario-party-superstars-tug-o-war-warning-minigame-palm-stick"&gt;less loved games&lt;/a&gt; — that have all been spruced up with a more modern presentation. If you didn’t play any of those originals, it basically feels like a new game, with visuals and animations on par with other titles on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17931854/super-mario-party-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;including the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Switch &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0T1OhREsxWOkqO-7BlLZTPoXnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873311/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iZAkHA"&gt;If you’re looking for a good collection of mini-games, and particularly if you have a fondness for the classic &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles, &lt;em&gt;Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will scratch that itch. It doesn’t have as many playable characters as new titles, and some players might miss the more modern motion control games. Mostly, it’s great, though — and that’s true no matter which iteration of the Switch hardware you’re playing it on. But the game is also a perfect test case for the OLED Switch’s much-improved kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKdVDm"&gt;The problem with the original was that the stand was both too small and flimsy; your Switch never felt fully secured, even on a flat surface. This made it less than ideal for playing multiplayer games where things might get a little hectic. I definitely never trusted it myself. On the OLED version of the Switch, though, the stand now extends across the length of the tablet, and it’s a lot more sturdy as a result. As an added bonus, it’s adjustable as well, offering multiple viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjfYoQ"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; is the quintessential living room game, the kind of experience where it’s great having a group of friends yelling at each other while sitting around the television. That’s still the case here. But it turns out it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; works really well in what Nintendo calls “tabletop” mode. This is where you have the Switch undocked, propped up on a tabletop, with everyone using their own Joy-Con controller to play.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHQJHus1SPFnCY6pPdD_8izExiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962701/Minigame_LeafLeap_NOA.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kTfLn5"&gt;The OLED Switch screen is big and bright, so I was able to play with two other people sitting around a coffee table, and everyone could see what was going on just fine. And given that &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; can get a little intense — seriously, just try playing a round of tug-of-war with a single Joy-Con — I was surprised to find that my Switch never toppled or even really wobbled. Arms were flying, people were yelling, and the game went on without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKvXi6"&gt;It may seem like a small thing, but the improved kickstand really fulfills that early promise from Nintendo. And it fits &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; especially well given that the series is basically a board game with some added digital frills. It’s not the kind of feature that sells new hardware, the way a beautiful OLED screen does, but it makes a big difference for this kind of game. Now you can finally be one of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nintendouk/status/1088561355748200448"&gt;those rooftop party people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gBI0l"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mario Party Superstars &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the Switch on October 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj4Itr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijisvd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook isn’t telling the whole story about its mental health research  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDoJr5y4rbvL5AdlKxpcCd156AE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056751/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company is attempting to minimize its own research&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sHOCMZ"&gt;Ever since &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published internal Facebook research that found Instagram harmed the well-being of teenage girls, the company’s defense has been to minimize and dismiss its own findings — saying documents were only relevant for internal product development. That’s nonsense, social science researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZsCoP"&gt;Though Facebook’s work by itself is limited, it fits into a larger set of data — including from researchers outside the company — that suggests social media can have harmful effects on mental health. And even if that context didn’t exist, Facebook’s work alone suggests something bad enough is going on that it should cause concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVIGdZ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; included internal slides discussing data that showed Instagram was linked with issues like anxiety, depression, suicidal thought, and body image issues. Facebook immediately went on the defensive, saying that the data was taken out of context, that it was subjective, and that it couldn’t prove anything about Instagram. The company’s efforts to obfuscate the research and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;smear the whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; who leaked it appear to be straight out of Big Tobacco’s playbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOXx8G"&gt;Experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted think that, while Facebook’s statements on its research may be technically correct, they’re somewhat misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wxjxh"&gt;“It’s completely disingenuous,” says Melissa Hunt, a psychologist and associate director of clinical training at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jq6w7x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s completely disingenuous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKrYPm"&gt;Facebook put up its own version of the leaked slides —  complete with annotations that it said “give more context” on the research. Many of those annotations stress that the data is “based on the subjective perceptions of the research participants,” and that it wasn’t designed to assess if or how Instagram &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; any positive or negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACjUlr"&gt;The annotations also repeatedly note that the research is &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Instagram-Teen-Annotated-Research-Deck-2.pdf"&gt;qualitative&lt;/a&gt;. It relied on subjective information collected on questionnaires and through conversations with Instagram users, and it didn’t collect data that determined how frequently users experienced things like depression or body image issues. Facebook is arguing, then, that the information only shows that some users say they feel that way — and that it’s not enough to draw a line between Instagram and the mental health of teen girls more broadly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hANgdp"&gt;Facebook said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the studies were designed to help its product teams understand how users feel about the products, “not to provide measures of prevalence, statistical estimates for the correlation between Instagram and mental health or to evaluate causal claims between Instagram and health/well-being.” That changes the inferences people can make about the data, a spokesperson said in the statement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBNsAq"&gt;On the surface, that’s not an unreasonable response, says Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Los Angeles, and associate director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles. The research &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; only based on survey data, and it &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; designed to measure if or how Instagram causes changes in people’s mental health. That’s a problem with a lot of research around social media and mental health, she says: it’s asking people how they feel at one point in time. “That doesn’t tell you much,” Subrahmanyam says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTRSlS"&gt;In that sense, Facebook’s right — there’s not much people can infer about the impact of a social media platform off of that type of data, Hunt says. In a vacuum, the limitations of research based on subjective survey responses from users mean it may not be particularly compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KNzn9X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the data from the study is not in a vacuum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fdVlRV"&gt;But the data from the study is not in a vacuum, Hunt says. Instead, it came out into a world where independent researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;also been studying mental health and social media&lt;/a&gt;, and where some have been studying it with the type of careful research design that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; figure out if social media causes changes in mental health.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7sZpn"&gt;Hunt &lt;a href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751"&gt;ran a study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that randomly assigned a group of undergraduate students to continue their typical use of Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, and another group to limit their use to 10 minutes on each platform a day. At the end of three weeks, the group that limited their use reported fewer feelings of loneliness and depression compared with the group that kept using social media as normal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tUeFs"&gt;“We have been finding these exact same things,” Hunt says. That consistency means researchers can take Facebook’s internal findings more seriously, despite the limitations, she says. “What this has conveniently done is provided us with nice illustrative content that simply echoes and mirrors and exemplifies exactly what we keep finding in experimental studies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEB2bk"&gt;Even without that context, and with the limitations of the survey data, the findings should be concerning enough that they should lead Facebook and other experts to start asking more questions, Hunt says. “It would still be deeply alarming and should instantly lead to more rigorous work,” Hunt says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoAdA1"&gt;Facebook could start doing that sort of work if it wanted to. Since the initial leak of the mental health work, whistleblower Frances Haugen has distributed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;mountain of documents&lt;/a&gt; detailing the company’s internal operations. They show just how much Facebook already knows about the impact of its platform on users — like how algorithmic changes made conversations on the platform angrier and more sensationalized, and how the platform can push users &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581"&gt;toward extremism&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6KCvE"&gt;It probably already has the data it needs for more extensive analysis on Instagram and teen mental health, Subrahmanyam says. “I’m pretty sure they do have data that speaks to the real question of the impact.” In 2012, Facebook and Cornell University researchers were able to manipulate users’ moods by changing the content of their news feeds. The research was &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/"&gt;ethically dubious&lt;/a&gt; — technically, it was legal, but the team didn’t get informed consent from users, triggering waves of criticism after it was published in 2014. That incident showed just how much information the company can and does collect on its users, Subrahmanyam says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swI7fw"&gt;If the company is trying to say that the findings from the internal study aren’t that bad, they should make that information — detailed breakdowns of how people engage with the platforms — public, she says. “Why are they not releasing the data that they have that shows the clicks and other behavior? I think they should be inviting researchers who have that expertise, and giving them that data and letting them do that analysis,” Subrahmanyam says. “Because they’re not open about that data, I can’t help but be skeptical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="12AWwq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because they’re not open about that data, I can’t help but be skeptical”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JN5o7o"&gt;There are parallels between Facebook’s approach to these issues and tobacco companies’ efforts to minimize the harm caused by cigarettes, Hunt says. Both rely on people coming back to their products over and over again, even if it’s not healthy for them. Social media can benefit teens and young adults if they stick to some guidelines — follow only people they know and like in real life, and don’t use it for more than around an hour a day, Hunt says. “But that runs directly counter to the business model these companies are built on,” she says — the model depends on people looking at content from as many people as possible, whom they may not know, for as many hours a day as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PQnkX"&gt;Tobacco companies had a similar model. “They knew perfectly well that their products were both highly addicting — in fact, they had been engineered to be as addictive as possible — and that they were harmful. And they suppressed those findings,” Hunt says. Big Tobacco also tried to discredit whistleblowers, similarly to how Facebook responded to Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnwtEi"&gt;Facebook executives, for their part, say that the tobacco analogies don’t make sense. “I don’t think it’s remotely like tobacco,” Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communication, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/facebook-whistleblower-big-tobacco"&gt;said on CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “I mean, social media apps, they’re apps. People download them on their phones, and why do they do that? I mean, there has to be a reason why a third of the world’s population enjoys using these apps.” For what it’s worth, in the 1960s, a tobacco executive took a similar position before Congress, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1965/09/the-quiet-victory-of-the-cigarette-lobby-how-it-found-the-best-filter-yet-congress/304762/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: “millions of persons throughout the world derive pleasure and enjoyment from smoking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkNLeX"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg said in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;his note&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook staffers that the company was committed to doing more research, and that it wasn’t suppressing data. “If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we’re doing?” he wrote. “If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BZ5f3S"&gt;But so far, the company hasn’t released the type of information third-party researchers want to see to actually understand the questions around social media and mental health. “These are really important questions, given how important social media has become,” Subrahmanyam says. “If it’s really not that bad, why not share it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXHGnw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6ARJh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard ends forced arbitration as CEO takes a massive pay cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOWgq4"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005446/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-Regarding-Progress-and-Commitments-Made-at-Activision-Blizzard"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; updating employees on the further steps he and the company will take to change its image in the wake of multiple sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits. Most notably, Kotick says that Activision Blizzard will employ a zero-tolerance harassment policy, waive arbitration in sexual harassment and discrimination claims, and the billion-dollar-net-worth CEO will take a massive pay cut — earning only $62,500 per year in total compensation until the board of directors feels certain diversity, equity, and inclusion goals are met. (Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard shareholders approved a &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-22-activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-koticks-usd155m-pay-package-approved-by-shareholders"&gt;$155 million pay package&lt;/a&gt; for Kotick.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6bpn2"&gt;The letter outlined other goals for the company, including an investment of $250 million over ten years in programs that support diversity in the gaming and technology industries. Activision Blizzard is also committing to expanding the number of women and nonbinary people it employs by 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKXlE5"&gt;Staring in July, Activision Blizzard was hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;several lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; from government agencies accusing the company of permitting a culture of sexual harassment, abuse, discrimination, retaliation, and other unfair labor practices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Employees staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and formed an advocacy group called A Better ABK demanding change from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZtBEG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our demands remain as follows and chief suite still fails to acknowledge them. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABetterABK?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ABetterABK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndAbuseInGaming?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EndAbuseInGaming&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Tk7aV9DjD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Tk7aV9DjD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tw320B"&gt;One of the chief demands of A Better ABK was the end to forced arbitration, greater pay transparency, and improved hiring practices that promote greater diversity and inclusion among Activision Blizzard’s workforce. Kotick’s letter seemingly addresses those demands and supports the company’s other actions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735413/activision-blizzard-employee-terminations-harassment-discrimination"&gt;the firing of over 20 people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740836/blizzard-overwatch-jesse-mccree-name-change-cole-cassidy"&gt;multiple updates to its games&lt;/a&gt; to remove problematic content, references, and people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays launch of its ‘hands-free’ BlueCruise driver assist feature until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwAAjBCEWh7XzuIao9J2LlCw-1g=/0x2:1434x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056565/BlueCruise_Mustang_Mach_E_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4LaiB"&gt;BlueCruise, the “hands-free” driver assist feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford sees as a viable competitor&lt;/a&gt; to GM’s Super Cruise and Tesla’s Autopilot, won’t reach car owners until the first quarter of 2022, the company’s executives said Wednesday night. The automaker had originally planned on pushing an over-the-air (OTA) software update activating BlueCruise for select Ford customers before the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdeifO"&gt;In an earnings call with investors, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company’s engineers needed a little more time to make the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) easier to use for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LweSw7"&gt;“We wanted to improve the customer experience,” Farley said. “So we pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we want it to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned. And that takes a little planning to consolidate. Often these Level 2 systems require multiple updates to the car. We want it to be very simple. That took a little bit more work on our team’s part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SFktOM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want it to be very simple. That took a little bit more work on our team’s part.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oqAzMY"&gt;Level 2 systems, as defined by the Society for Automotive Engineers’ levels of automation, work in concert with a number of distinct features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection, pedestrian monitoring, and stop sign detection. These systems do not make the vehicle autonomous, as drivers are required to stay vigilant and keep their eyes on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ymk0j"&gt;Ford also included an active driver monitoring system in the form of an infrared sensor on the steering column that tracks the driver’s eyes to make sure they are keeping them on the road. In that way, drivers can technically take their hands off the wheel on “prequalified sections of divided highways” that Ford has mapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHTQ6N"&gt;Ford said that it was currently shipping 2021 F-150 pickup trucks and 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUVs to customers with BlueCruise functionality, but that the system would not be activated until the OTA software update is ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWJTff"&gt;“Given the importance of this technology upgrade, we’ve retimed the BlueCruise over-the-air update so we can deliver the highest-quality experience possible for customers,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INg7GL"&gt;Ford has said it expects to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4DlmW"&gt;Car consumers are certainly attracted to more high-tech systems, especially if they can promise a safer, more stress-free driving experience. A survey conducted by Edmunds in late 2017 found that 58 percent of car shoppers would pay an extra $1,000 or more for a vehicle equipped with active safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpdHCr"&gt;The ADAS has grown highly competitive in the auto industry, as automakers seek to roll out more advanced systems to customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712566/gm-ultra-cruise-adas-hands-free-driving"&gt;GM recently announced&lt;/a&gt; a new version of Super Cruise called “Ultra Cruise,” that — when it ships in 2023 — will cover “95 percent” of all driving scenarios. Meanwhile, Tesla is pushing its “Full Self-Driving” beta software on more and more customers, despite warnings from government regulators that the system is being deceptively marketed as a fully autonomous system. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rad Power Bikes overtakes VanMoof to become the ‘most funded’ e-bike company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umJn0w6nV7gSPwXDubst346__s4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056451/ahawkins_210914_4767_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUOM2Y"&gt;Rad Power Bikes announced that it had raised $154 million from investors as it seeks to grow its e-bike empire in the US and abroad. The company now claims it is the “most funded electric bike company in the world,” a little more than a month after Amsterdam-based VanMoof &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651860/vanmoof-128-million-funding-most-funded-ebike-company"&gt;made the same claim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqEyKB"&gt;For over a year, Rad Power Bikes and VanMoof have been in a neck-and-neck race to raise enough investment cash to help capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;the bike boom&lt;/a&gt; while also smoothing out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;rough edges of their direct-to-consumer business models&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, VanMoof announced that it had raised $182 million over two years, with almost 200,000 bikes on the road currently and a five-year goal of getting 10 million people on VanMoof e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oym1mR"&gt;Now, Rad Power Bikes is saying it has retaken the lead. “Rad is the true front-runner,” Rad Power Bikes CEO Mike Radenbaugh said in an interview. “The leader in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NI3OWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The leader in the space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Vd6h"&gt;Radenbaugh says the company has raised a total of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;$304 million this year alone&lt;/a&gt; and $329 million since the business started in 2007. It presently has 350,000 customers riding its e-bikes and is projected to add another 100,000 customers in the latter half of 2021. The company, which Radenbaugh says operates at about break-even, currently offers 11 e-bike models and plans to add more in the future. And after years of relying on manufacturing in China, Rad Power Bikes has plans to bring some of its manufacturing capabilities to North America and Europe in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2lrGB"&gt;“Our priority is getting bikes to our riders and creating ... the most seamless experience end-to-end as possible,” Radenbaugh said. “So we see bringing additional manufacturing locations as a way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wccSWd"&gt;Like most companies today, Rad Power Bikes is feeling the pinch of supply chain constraints. Radenbaugh said the biggest bottleneck has been ocean freight, followed closely by drayage, or short-haul trucking. As a short-term solution, the company chartered several of its own vessels to deliver bikes and other parts from overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5NUWj"&gt;The company will triple the number of retail locations and mobile service locations by the end of 2022, he said. Rad Power Bikes currently has showrooms and service centers in Seattle, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; San Diego, California; and Utrecht, Netherlands. By the end of the year, the company will also have tripled its distribution capacity, having opened multiple new centers in recent months. Radenbaugh said customers will soon be able to receive bikes and accessories within a week or less of ordering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MOQMYs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rad Power Bikes has plans to bring some of its manufacturing capabilities to North America&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLKAC3"&gt;Rad Power Bikes’ investors in this round are the same as the previous one: Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund, Counterpoint Global; Fidelity Management and Research Company; The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG; and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvNo1R"&gt;Radenbaugh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296195/electric-bike-ebike-diy-youtube-conversion-kit-cost"&gt;who used to build his own e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; as a kid growing up in Northern California, founded the company in 2007. Since then, it’s risen to become the largest e-bike company in the US. Radenbaugh sees Rad Power Bikes — which makes big, heavy, durable bikes — as a challenge to legacy bike manufacturers and their focus on recreational products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U36Pdw"&gt;“We popularized fat tires on e-bikes, throttles on e-bikes, big batteries, lots of power, universal front and rear racking systems, e-bikes that are designed to replace cars,” he said. “These fitness-oriented bike companies are integrating an off-the-shelf powertrain from a powertrain provider that does the same thing for 100 other brands ... That’s sort of a low volume and not world-changing way to think about building an e-bike company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkdslM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hands-on: Nvidia’s GeForce Now just leapfrogged Google Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdtECqUfozRNRyNzsIXW-K7ZnT8=/0x0:1740x1160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056409/geforce_now.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cloud gaming may have finally arrived — for some&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DrBweq"&gt;Nvidia just kicked Google’s butt. That’s my overarching takeaway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbsDJ"&gt;One week ago, Nvidia announced it would effectively begin renting out its impossible-to-buy RTX 3080 graphics card over the internet. The graphics giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;now offers a new tier of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt;, $99 for a six-month membership, that promises 4K HDR gaming at 60fps, or 1440p at 120fps, delivered to practically any device you own, with far lower latency than Nvidia’s service has ever offered before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tatBCB"&gt;I spent a huge chunk of yesterday testing it out on my phone, laptop, a borrowed Nvidia Shield TV set-top box, and even my own RTX 3080-equipped desktop PC for some direct comparisons. And on the performance front, at least, I came away impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="oziSLn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8952587"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EiqXe0"&gt;I should warn you that I tested under best-case conditions: I live near Nvidia’s west coast servers, I’m using 5GHz Wi-Fi and/or wired Ethernet to connect, and while I hate Comcast, it does tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/21/5434678/netflix-and-comcast-may-have-come-to-a-new-peering-agreement"&gt;favorable peering arrangements&lt;/a&gt; that keep me from seeing a lot of lag in online games. But that goes for Google’s service too, so let’s get into it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;In 2019, it was clear&lt;/a&gt; Google’s Stadia had surpassed every other nascent cloud gaming service in terms of responsive gameplay and clear image quality, even if “4K” was a lie. It’s equally clear today that Nvidia has leapt ahead on both fronts — to the point it’s starting to feel like a valid alternative to a next-gen game console &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a promising stopgap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;if chip shortages mean&lt;/a&gt; you can’t find the console or PC parts you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcLbeu"&gt;Let’s make the console comparison first, because I think it’s the more favorable by far. I fired up &lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition, Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;the $150 Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;, the only platform where the company currently offers 4K HDR streaming. While these aging games don’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;PS5 &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels of detail, it otherwise felt like I’d just plugged in the best game console ever made. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at 4K is everything the Stadia version was not: crisp, detailed graphics that actually feel like 4K. I launched it again on Stadia and found it muddy by comparison. Then I fired up &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, maxed out the settings at 3,840 x 2,160, bumped up the field of view to 90 degrees, and still saw it stay well above 60fps in a frantic firefight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcXPN2"&gt;And I felt competent in those fights: the controls felt roughly as responsive as they do on a console, if not as good as a mouse and keyboard on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSCxbH"&gt;But for me, the real console-style winner was &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, which ran butter-smooth at an AI-upscaled (DLSS) 4K at the highest levels of detail with half the ray tracing features turned on. While I’m not usually a fan of DLSS on a computer monitor, I couldn’t really tell the difference at the distance I play from my TV. Considering that the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-control-ultimate-edition-tested-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;are lower-res and lock you to 30fps if you want raytracing&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the single best way to play &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;if you’ve got the money and don’t have data caps — I clocked it at nearly 50Mbps, which is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5_xw7BXLQWYWN3S7NExNmR6_YU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962364/nvidia_geforce_now_pixel_4a_8bitdo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s pretty damn cool to carry a completely playable ray traced AAA game in your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CPirKm"&gt;On phone, too, I was impressed. At native 1080p, &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;let me max out every single setting including ray tracing and ran beautifully — quite a bit better than it did on my old GTX 1080 desktop, frankly. I measured my Pixel 4a pulling down up to 30Mbps while streaming that. (I haven’t tried over cellular yet, nor did I get to try 120Hz on a phone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3NEoia"&gt;I just wouldn’t quite pick GeForce Now over an actual RTX 3080 desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esnmxz"&gt;Technically, it’s got more horsepower than my desktop: with a 16-core AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX and an Nvidia A10G with 24GB of VRAM, the company’s servers were 12 percent faster in the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark, and I’m not surprised based on those specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="cmVS8Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10832128"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9I6Iqt"&gt;But Nvidia made a choice to only offer 4K HDR streaming on its Shield TV set-top box to start, not on PC — and both the lower resolution and lack of HDR really hurt my PC experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gfe0qL"&gt;When streaming games are perfectly still, they can look almost as good as games running natively. Here’s some screenshots I captured in &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; on different platforms so you can see what I mean (blow them up to full-res first please):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btB-Vsp7Ngeehy9ml2C1VDJmeWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962367/gfn_pc_stadia_control_texture_comparison.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: 1440p on an RTX 3080 PC; 1440p on GFN; 1080p on GFN; 1440p on Google Stadia (captured earlier in the game so no ramps).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NYkY4Y"&gt;If you look closely, you’ll see more fine detail in Jesse’s hair, her leather jacket, and her jeans, but it’s only when you get to Stadia (where Google is clearly rendering less detail) that we see a huge gap in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTuqtx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;has even less of a gap between streaming and native when the game’s completely still: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="CuZUOy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10832144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0uxNV6"&gt;What I can’t easily show you, not even properly in a video, is how muddy a stream can get when objects are moving... and those moving objects are getting compressed into images that can easily be streamed across the internet... and then that compression creates nasty image artifacts that smear across your field of view. But I can try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wY6F8p_FoOdWVOOaVzrWsdgwXuk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962371/tomb_raider_muddy_run.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What... exactly... is Lara running towards?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dCaPQs"&gt;This has plagued cloud gaming for years, and it’s particularly noticeable at lower render resolutions and in distant, grey regions like fog, smoke, steam, or simply semi-dark areas. Different video compression techniques can help, and that’s part of why Google Stadia was remarkably better at this than GeForce Now was in 2019. But a higher resolution stream and HDR also help a lot — I don’t see these issues nearly as much in the 4K HDR stream on my big TV, even when I stand up close. But on my desktop at 1440p, there’s a lot of the smearing going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1ZwvjA"&gt;Cloud gaming’s state of the art has just advanced thanks to a new infusion of hardware, but there are still plenty of reasons to hesitate. For one thing, this is the second time this year that Nvidia’s doubled the price of its top GeForce Now tier, first from $4.99 a month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336600/nvidia-geforce-now-price-tier-cloud-gaming-subscription"&gt;to $9.99 a month in March&lt;/a&gt;, and now from $99.99 a year to $99.99 for six months (though the previous tier is still around and “founders” are grandfathered into that one for life as long as they keep paying the bill.) That price includes access to many games that are free-to-play on other platforms, but you’ll need to bring paid games from Steam, EGS and Uplay yourself. Your savegames do come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcBHvG"&gt;For another, I’m not convinced GeForce Now is very tolerant of bursts of network congestion: my &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; session became totally unplayable after my wife started syncing a bunch of files to Dropbox, and freaked out again when she downloaded a single app installer to her MacBook a little later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PByCWx"&gt;The reason I won’t buy in, though, is because large portions of my PC game collection simply aren’t there since Nvidia can’t obtain the streaming rights. I can’t play &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; or&lt;em&gt; Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sekiro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Nier Automata&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, all of which are on my current slate. Nvidia’s adding new games every week, including titles as new as &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, but Nvidia can’t promise that some of them won’t also disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lx3ZvL"&gt;Still, real RTX 3080 cards &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-pricing-index"&gt;are still going for $1,600 on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, and PC hardware in general is very expensive to piece together right now. Gaming rigs use a lot of electricity, too, and energy costs are soaring in parts of the world. For the right person, $200 a year doesn’t sound like too much to ask for a competent gaming PC in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can save up to $700 on LG’s brilliant C1 OLED today at multiple retailers.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Chp932"&gt;You can save up to $700 on one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt; today, the LG C1. Right now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F313720184065%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals102821%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F22748849%2Fapple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s digital storefront on eBay&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 55-inch model for $1,297 instead of $1,500, while adding $120 of eBay credit and a four-year extended warranty. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%2522-class---c1-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---allstate-3-year-protection-plan-bundle-included-for-5-years-of-total-coverage*.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have the 65-inch versions for $1,800 and $1,797, respectively, though you’ll need to be a Costco member to take advantage of its discount. If you are a Costco member, however, the OLED TV comes with an Allstate Protection Plan —  an extended three-year warranty for your TV — and a $100 streaming credit toward Google Play, Paramount Plus, Showtime, or several other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5d3TKA"&gt;No matter which C1 model you buy, however, all sport several features gamers in particular will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR compatibility. All of the configurations also offer support for VRR (variable refresh rate), along with FreeSync and G-Sync adaptive sync technologies, meaning you can enjoy high frame rates without screen tearing. Their HDMI 2.1 support means all of these specs will work well with next-gen consoles, including the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, while the “Game Optimizer” dashboard makes it possible to quickly apply your ideal settings for specific game genres.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically $249, you can currently buy the latest version of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best pairs of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; for $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5amXM"&gt;As the name suggests, the updated charging case for the AirPods Pro is compatible with Apple’s MagSafe charging system. Despite this, it still works with Qi chargers and Lightning cables, and provides for up to 24 hours of playback. The earbuds boast deep integration with iOS and excellent noise cancellation, too, the latter of which silences background noise so you can concentrate more easily on what you’re listening to. They also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can make for a more immersive listening experience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="uO3HIC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sIzbeu"&gt;Android users, we also have a great earbuds deal for you. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWY75DH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; at their lowest price to date. Regularly $200, the wireless earbuds are just $141 in the phantom violet style and slightly more in different colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDo9su"&gt;As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro had the best sound quality yet of any of the company’s earbuds. Like the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s earbuds also support active noise cancellation and 3D audio, which is essentially Samsung’s version of Apple’s spatial audio feature. However, the Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance — beating the AirPods Pro’s IPX4. They also allow you to automatically switch between your Galaxy smartphone and tablet, though this feature doesn’t apply to laptops. In addition, their Qi-enabled charging case also allows for 28 hours of playback without noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="viLELE"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is selling at its lowest price ever on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, going for $520 instead of $600. The smart 4K monitor, which is also selling for the same price at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSvKg0ylwZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, acts as a TV for your PC that you can even mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. It can stream HDR10 content from a host of popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, meaning you can easily cast content from a host of Apple devices. The monitor also comes with a solar-powered remote control and support for Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V5VbmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KtZxA"&gt;If you have an iPhone 12-series or iPhone 13-series phone, perhaps picking up Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack has come across your mind before. It’s the company’s battery that magnetically snaps onto the back of those phones and begins charging. You can also charge devices like the AirPods Pro with it. Now is officially the best time to buy, since the battery pack is cheaper than ever at Amazon. Regularly $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $80&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jlfMWw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6wWl5"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K just launched last month, yet Amazon is already selling the 2021 model at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering the streaming device for $35&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s not dramatically different from its predecessor, Roku’s latest streaming stick is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, so you can also use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. And, of course, the stick continues to offer access to popular streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Vudu, Prime Video, HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, and Sling TV. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
