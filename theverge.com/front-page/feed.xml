    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store cube stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbql_Y8lQk52pmKhPsCxgYqN-xw=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394216/theverge3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mILrja"&gt;“Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,” Apple states in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgxOlg"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests&lt;/a&gt; before entering the office, with unvaccinated retail workers testing twice per week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;lowered the frequency of these tests&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that Apple’s “infrequent” testing policy no longer applies to employees who don’t receive the booster shot by Apple’s deadline, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sp61V"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;Meta said employees will need to get a COVID-19 booster shot&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the company’s return to in-office work in March. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;have the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices"&gt;take weekly molecular tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let dating apps offer third-party payment options in the Netherlands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-G1OIsdNoZpjEYYJ4rTZp7cd0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393949/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oc0YNi"&gt;Apple will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands in compliance with the Dutch regulator’s ruling, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-15/apple-will-add-additional-payment-options-for-dutch-dating-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow dating apps — and only dating apps — distributed in the country to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSHZQL"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql"&gt;a message to developers on its site&lt;/a&gt;, Apple explains that it’s introducing &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/"&gt;two new optional “entitlements,”&lt;/a&gt; or specific app capabilities, that will let developers add third-party payment processors for dating apps in the Netherlands. Dating app developers can either direct customers to a website to complete their purchase or add a third-party payment service within the app. However, if developers choose to snub Apple’s payment service in favor of an alternative, Apple says it won’t be able to help users with refunds, subscription management, or any payment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEFNMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWesu1"&gt;Apple has appealed the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets’ (ACM) decision. “Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court,” Apple explains. “We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K53ogY"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852966/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-match-tinder-app-store-competition"&gt;the ACM ruled that Apple allow dating apps in the country to offer third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;, and if the company failed to do so by January 15th, it would face a 5 million Euro-per-week fine. The &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-launches-investigation-abuse-dominance-apple-its-app-store"&gt;ACM began its investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s payment rules in 2019, concentrating specifically on dating apps following a complaint from Match Group, which owns popular online dating services Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHp9Z3"&gt;Apple’s payment policies have stirred up controversy across the globe, with South Korea introducing legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877952/apple-third-party-payments-app-store-south-korea"&gt;requires the company to allow in-app third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;. Its restriction on alternate payment services is also the catalyst behind the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple — a court order that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;forces Apple to allow external payment options&lt;/a&gt; was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;put on hold after an appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Apple made a small compromise and agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;let “reader” apps point customers to external sites&lt;/a&gt; for subscription signups.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yellowjackets has reawakened my inner Lost fan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="yellowjackets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6I7OX-xF4WzAJFwG4chBRefoBo=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393860/FEAlvwrVkAUjpmf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1hUuy"&gt;For the last few weeks, my mind has been filled with questions that, out of context, make little sense. I’ve thought long and hard about why a high school girl would start eating dirt and which middle-aged man might be covered in glitter. I’ve pondered the significance of everything from psychedelic mushrooms to a high school soccer coach’s pep talk to a missing bullet in a police officer’s gun. I’ve even rewatched video to see if a state championship-winning goal was offside — and don’t get me started on how much I’ve thought about cannibalism. What I’m saying is: &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; has completely taken over my brain. I haven’t been this obsessed with theorizing about events in a television show since the cast of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; discovered the hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX9YRD"&gt;On the surface, there are some very obvious connections between &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt;. Both center on a plane crash in which the survivors find themselves in the wilderness where a bunch of weird shit starts happening. Both jump around in time, exploring not only the events in the wild but also the cast’s life before and after the tragedy. Most crucially, both are absolutely jam-packed with secrets, making theorizing about what’s actually happening arguably the most fun part of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C51BQ1"&gt;It’s not like there haven’t been weird mysteries since &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, I watched the ongoing Microsoft Surface ad known as &lt;em&gt;Under the Dome&lt;/em&gt;. But none of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;’s successors has grabbed me quite the same way that &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; has. I actually came to the show a few weeks late and binged the first half in a single night, before fitting Sunday evening viewings into my schedule. It didn’t take long at all; I’ve been hooked since the first five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W3vgBw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYznLoeS_mA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0b35ck"&gt;It starts out in the perfect way: pure &lt;em&gt;what the fuck?&lt;/em&gt; energy. A young girl, chased through a frozen forest, with unsettling whispers and screams in the background, ends up impaled on spikes in a trap beneath the snow. Then there’s a gruesome ritual that I’d rather not think about too much. From there, things get a little more wholesome, shifting to the titular Yellowjackets, a high school soccer team from New Jersey that just won the state championship, earning them a spot at nationals. (I remain convinced that the game-winning goal was, in fact, offside, but I need to see some better camera angles to be sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOXtED"&gt;There are many different kinds of dramas happening in &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; simultaneously. There’s the typical teenage stuff from before the crash, as the girls deal with parties and boyfriends and their on-field dynamics. There’s the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;-style breakdown in the woods, as the team — and a few other folks who happened to be stuck on the plane, like the obsessive and possessive equipment manager Misty — try to survive in the wilderness. And then we have the present day, when the survivors struggle to keep it together after everything they went through; one is just getting out of rehab, while another lets loose on a reporter looking for juicy details on the crash. And all of this is set to a musical backdrop of this one mixtape I made myself in 1995 by recording Smashing Pumpkins songs from the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCj7rN"&gt;It’s this combination of bizarre moments, intense drama, and time-shifting storytelling that makes &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; work so well — and makes it so ideal for theorizing. First, you’ll see something that’s either shocking or confusing. It could be dark, like a ritual killing or a suspicious suicide or a kid wearing antlers like some kind of mystical goddess. Or it could be something smaller, like a strange symbol that keeps appearing with no explanation. These moments all provoke questions, and as the story shifts around in time, it rarely clears things up. Instead, it piles on the mysteries and makes you wonder if the answer you’re seeking might just be found in a different time. A great example of this is the survivors; until someone makes an appearance in the present, or you see them die, you never actually know if someone made it through the ordeal in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="yellowjackets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46a2xG_adq_hNwaiMsaQGEvkt5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169421/FEAkzkcUUAISeH5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Showtime&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FoI50J"&gt;As any &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; fan will tell you, this kind of structure can be frustrating, particularly if it doesn’t pay off. That show was a deluge of cool, weird ideas — a smoke monster! a hatch! also polar bears? — that ultimately never went anywhere. But I still loved it. The mysteries were fun enough even without satisfying answers, and besides, they were also an excuse to spend lots of time with these characters. The cast of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is a delight and totally unpredictable, to the point that I’d watch for the &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;-style drama alone. (Seriously, Misty scares me, and that’s true in any time period.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VI5Zk"&gt;So far, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is evoking all of those same feelings for me that&lt;em&gt; Lost&lt;/em&gt; did. Sure, I’d love the finale to satisfy my lingering curiosity and to find out who is really behind the antlers. But the ride so far has already been a blast. It’s the journey, as they say, not necessarily the destination. Only, in this case, the journey involves teens eating each other and a seance gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdp6Kp"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final episode of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;’ first season airs on Showtime on January 16th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a design museum unearthed a treasure trove of classic Slovak games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/71EDrmOsnr8OPdaBm21y8vhwUVM=/0x32:774x548/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393767/S_atochin.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Šatochin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hAxVN9"&gt;Late last year, the Slovak Design Museum released a translated collection of ’80s text adventures from the region. The games, often programmed by teenagers, capture a moment in history when the first generation of Slovak developers were learning their craft to share among their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifwunf"&gt;The museum didn’t always cover games. Maroš Brojo, the general manager of the Slovak Game Developers Association, pitched the multimedia collection that he now curates. “When you get the patronage of a museum… it gives you much more credibility,” he says. “Suddenly, people start to have a very different view of this actually being part of something important. Our culture and our heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Xd6DT"&gt;The 10 games that make up this first batch of translations and re-releases were selected for their historical significance. They capture a part of the late ’80s in what was then Czechoslovakia, a Soviet satellite state. In one, &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;, the titular Soviet Major fights with Rambo in Vietnam. “I don’t want to say [it was] against the regime, but it’s very subversive,” says Brojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrQxEw"&gt;One of the developers behind &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;, Stanislav Hrda, was also involved in the translation and preservation project. He was 16 when he and some friends published &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt; after being fascinated by the American movies that made it across the border on VHS tapes. “This game is making jokes [about] the regime… and the Soviet army,” he says. “It’s hard to win. So when you are playing, Rambo will kill you 10 times because you [were] not lucky, and you made the wrong choice. It was very funny for my friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wsSVJZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get the patronage of a museum… it gives you much more credibility.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hsw4Cr"&gt;Ten may be underselling it — in my experimentation with &lt;em&gt;Šatochín, &lt;/em&gt;the Soviet soldier lost his life in a handful of gruesome ways, including being crushed against a coral reef, within just a few minutes of starting the game. Hrda also integrated an Easter egg into the game, where binding the keys “KGB” as controls would allow the player to play as Rambo himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQp361"&gt;Game development was primarily a teenage hobby at the time. Because games weren’t sold in shops, there was no chance of making money out of it. Hrda and others shared these games among their friends for entertainment rather than profit. At one point, &lt;em&gt;Šatochín &lt;/em&gt;made it into the hands of František Fuka, a developer from Prague who had previously inspired Hrda and his friends. In Hrda’s words, he told them, “Yeah, you guys made such a nice, fun game, but be prepared and take a toothbrush with you because when the police come to catch you, you must be ready.” Hrda laughs as he says it, but he admits that he was “a bit afraid” after that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LYplLieA1dU0QkCsPA85XOIW1vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167268/Cover_1024x768.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gb3FA6"&gt;But he and his friends continued to make games, calling themselves Sybilasoft. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 led to more democratic governance and a market economy being established in Czechoslovakia, Hrda, then 18, created a real company to sell games. With financing now available, he says, programmers across Czechoslovakia were able to create “very high-quality games for the ZX Spectrum.” But in the West, people had moved on to more advanced computers, leaving the creations of Hrda, Fuka, and others to be played primarily in Eastern Europe only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptZU4c"&gt;But a few years ago, Hrda was involved in an exhibition at the Design Museum that showed off these games from the ’80s, allowing people to play them on the original hardware. More exhibitions were planned — before COVID got in the way. Brojo calls the website “sort of a backup virtual exhibition, but also says that he’s pleased that it can form the beginning of a database as they continue to develop the project further. As well as the games themselves, which can be run on emulators on modern PCs, there are images of the hardware, box art, and so on from the period. Brojo says that his next goal is to add scans of ’80s and ’90s Slovak game magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ArrPD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Keep playing good games, and if you are brave enough, you can try ours.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7S5uv"&gt;Along with the translations, the website also makes the games accessible to a wider audience. Brojo says that the team was lucky that much of that work had been done by ZX Spectrum fan communities like&lt;a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php"&gt; Spectrum Computing&lt;/a&gt;, so they didn’t have to salvage much from cassettes and the like. And finding the original developers in order to get their permission was usually straightforward. “Most of the community was very friendly, so a lot of the authors know other authors, and they were able to get us in touch with them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikka9B"&gt;The tricky part was disassembling the games so that Slovak text could be replaced with English. Programmer Slavomír Labský and translation coordinator Marián Kabát wrote about some of their experience in a post on the&lt;a href="https://scd.sk/clanky/playable-english-localizations-of-slovak-digital-games-from-the-late-80s-period/"&gt; Slovak Design Museum’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Labský explains his process in taking the games apart and replacing them once the translations were delivered to him, taking into account difficulties like the short lengths of the text segments. Kabát described the challenges of contextualizing era- and location-specific references, such as those to popular folk singers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hvsok"&gt;Brojo says he hopes that the nuances of the games will come across in these translations, like the subversive writing in &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, he mentions that the 1987 game &lt;em&gt;Pepsi Cola&lt;/em&gt; appears to be the one that English-speaking people are most interested in on social media. Developed in part by Fuka, it tasks the player with stealing the drink’s secret recipe. Brojo assumes that the recognizability of the brand is curious to Western players. “It might be sort of a bizarre thing that we also knew Pepsi Cola in the East before 1989,” he says. “Although Pepsi Cola was actually one of the most popular soft drinks.” (It had been sold in the Soviet Union since 1972.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9ZsqOe"&gt;But the historical value of the games isn’t the only reason they’ve been made available. Instead, Hrda just wants people to enjoy them like his friends did back when he made them. “I [hope people] will have fun with them even if those games are very old,” he laughs. “Keep playing good games, and if you are brave enough, you can try ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjkAwO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ChiQ"&gt;If you’re on the market for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds, today we’re seeing some great discounts on both the new Jabra Elite 3 earbuds &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Jabra’s older Elite 75t. Already considered Jabra’s budget buds, the Elite 3 typically retail for $79.99 but are on sale today for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Chris Welch praised the earbuds, noting that they sound better than he expected given their price. He was also impressed by their performance, decent call quality, no-fuss controls, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTXNHE"&gt;However, if you’re looking for wireless earbuds that offer features like noise cancellation, the $149.99 Elite 75t are also on sale at Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp0dUvFa7T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly matches their best price to date. While the noise cancellation on these isn’t quite as good as it is on the newer &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26374473.5227/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb3df85a2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, they both boast excellent sound with a good amount of bass. The Elite 75t are also comfortable and capable of connecting to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, a feature still not commonly found in many wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Elite 75t review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pPy4Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XILdnP"&gt;Shifting from wireless earbuds to high-quality microphones, the $129.99 Blue Yeti mic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in select colors for $99.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp5KfMrnfX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; this includes the black model, which Amazon hasn’t discounted since July. While not its best price ever, this is the lowest we’ve seen the mic sell for since the holidays. A popular staple with podcasters, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, the Yeti is capable of conforming to a number of different recording environments. It also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio, rendering it one of the more versatile budget options out there for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lggHuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904ZHRjPs"&gt;DJI’s Mavic Mini remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best drones you can buy for under $500&lt;/a&gt;, however, $450 is still a lot of money. Thankfully, if you’re looking for something more affordable, its 2019 predecessor is available today at Newegg with a handful of accessories. Right now, you can buy the last-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeDailyDeals1152022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-00345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo for just $299.99&lt;/a&gt;, a solid $100 discount. The bundle includes three sets of spare propellers, a carrying bag, a propeller guard, a gimbal protector, spare batteries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904Y1gSCr"&gt;Despite the fact the Mavic Mini is an older, more budget-friendly drone, it still shares many features in common with more expensive models, like a number of creative shooting modes and the ability to automatically return to its takeoff spot. It also doesn’t require FAA registration, a boon for experienced drone pilots and newcomers alike. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mEkTeZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T07o9o"&gt;Some other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AWG8HQ"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, Amazon is selling a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership and a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MTZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $34.99 (nearly $40 off&lt;/a&gt;), giving you a way to game online and expand your console’s storage space at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwVNY7"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods are still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the low price of $139.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They originally sold for $179.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5OXiV"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2 with a built-in wireless charging pad &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgqmnNTjMYj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $64.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $89.99.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Why you might want a secure file-sharing service now that you’re working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYPvkvxWjZliIvCdF13ieBjmUoA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393577/VRG_ILL_4947_How_to_securely_share_files.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1F6FaM"&gt;When we were all at the office, many of us were connected to the office network. We didn’t need to give sharing files much thought. But now that we’re scattered across the landscape, securely sharing important files can take careful planning. Here’s why you might want to use powerful file-sharing services to share sensitive files safely, so you can collaborate better no matter where you’re working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI6AcM"&gt;Probably the easiest way to share a file is to just attach a document to an email, or to a Slack or other instant message. But either way invites trouble on several fronts. If you rely too much on your email or messaging system, your poorly archived files could become available to prying hackers with phishing lures. If you’re sharing traditional documents that way, you could also quickly find yourself playing the “who has the most current version” game. It’s hard to keep track of updates when multiple people are working on the same document, spreadsheet, or presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTmqQy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Drive and OneDrive have their flaws, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ItmoN1"&gt;While built-in collaboration tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft OneDrive (or something equivalent based on your email identity) can solve the version control problem — and might be your only option if your company insists — they can become cumbersome the moment your team expands beyond your office domain. You might inadvertently share the document with people who shouldn’t see it, or lock someone out who needs access. The more convoluted you make your sharing situation, the greater the potential for a mistake where the world (or perhaps family members) gain access to your files. We’ve all seen the news stories where a database or collection of documents fell into the wrong hands because someone failed to apply the appropriate security. Some companies won’t risk it: With one of my clients, I had to get a new email address on their domain to share their Google Docs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM2M8W"&gt;Besides Google Workspace and OneDrive, there are more than a dozen different providers of personal file-sharing services, including Dropbox, Box, and Apple’s iCloud. Many of these are free or nearly so for minimal use. But if you are contemplating these services, everyone in your sharing circle should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use two-factor authentication (such as Authy)&lt;/a&gt; to access them, not just a username and password. Even so, they’re often second-rate when it comes to user experience (Dropbox’s collaboration features can be confusing, iCloud and Windows have a complicated relationship, and Box’s file preview feature doesn’t do such a great job). They’re adequate for single-use sharing or sharing files across your own devices, but they’re  not my preferred solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggY4j"&gt;Instead, you should consider an enterprise-grade cloud-based file-sharing service, one that adds more layers of protection by encrypting your data, and that has fine-tuned access control. Egnyte, SecureDocs, ShareFile, and SugarSync are just a few of the more popular services; here’s a chart with a rough comparison of how much they cost and what they offer to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgDLgO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8g3IU1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sxwchA"&gt;Regardless of which one you pick, here’s what you should look for when researching a secure file-sharing service: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PfyXm2"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Automatic file sync &lt;/strong&gt;for all users on all devices, including integration with Windows Explorer and MacOS’s Finder, so you can browse shared directories and keep local copies for quick access. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BilKaE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Support for Android, iOS, and web clients &lt;/strong&gt;to browse shared directories and folders on the go as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZgCfTa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;End-to-end encryption&lt;/strong&gt;. If someone manages to download your files without your login, they shouldn’t be able to do anything with them. ShareFile also has an Outlook plug-in that encrypts your files as an extra feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l7tmFa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional login security&lt;/strong&gt;. SecureDocs requires additional authentication by default for all of its logins, while the others I mention have it as an option. Setting this up is as simple as scanning a QR code into a smartphone app, as shown below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0mtR2QUrTe0q2tabjasjBqqsLxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23171369/qr_code_authorization.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ue6weu"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Easy-to-disable public sharing options&lt;/strong&gt;, or that they make it difficult to inadvertently choose to share publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mh9U3Z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customizable permissions and access rights&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that the right people are sharing the right file collections. Egnyte, for example, has numerous controls to add a password to your file, allow or disable downloads, and notifications, as you can see in the screenshot below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-GOMXrhLEId6W7LMm-lAmOS-M8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146003/access_control_egynte.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="unzfWf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Audit trails&lt;/strong&gt; to figure out and fix when someone accidentally shares a file with the entire internet, or so you can quickly remove a shared file if it is no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk890e"&gt;Many of these products have free trials (of the ones I mention above, all but SugarSync don’t require any payment details), and you can use those periods to evaluate them. Asking yourself these questions should also help you pick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hIChok"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you routinely share very large files&lt;/strong&gt;, such as videos or illustrated PowerPoint documents? Some services place limits on individual files; SugarSync, for instance, has a limit on web client upload size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ESW1cJ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What other software tools work with the file-sharing service&lt;/strong&gt;? Some (such as Egnyte) integrate with Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Slack, which makes sharing files easier to use as part of your normal workflows. Check the fine print if this is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RvgWzm"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you need a room&lt;/strong&gt;? Some services offer a common shared “data room” that can be the cloud equivalent of a shared network file server. ShareFile and SecureDocs both offer unlimited space for their shared rooms. Others, such as Egnyte, cap the room at 1TB, which is still a lot of storage if you’re not a video producer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdZqKC"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What other specialized services do you need&lt;/strong&gt;? Some services integrate with e-signature apps (ShareFile works with Citrix’s RightSignature), allow for custom workflows (like document approvals) and other tasks that can be real time-savers in a corporate environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PLTqIr"&gt;Using any enterprise sharing service will take some adjustment, but I feel they are worth the effort to gain additional peace of mind, better security, and collaborative features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8ZQ6F2601Vo7AEwFugPl0G63SE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392555/bfarsace_190903_3639_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 headphones are just $241 instead of $399.99 at Adorama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yBGHO"&gt;With many people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B19IV"&gt;That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L17MDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFH8rh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_nLgkBiQonGQmGOHNTMQMj8pn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700256/IMG_0640_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSgzPh"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtIOrp"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoMJX"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date. They remained around that price throughout the holiday season, but, unfortunately, many retailers have since ended their sales. Some retailers, however, are offering bundle deals that are still worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE9AC9"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=TheVergeBestNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling the WH-1000XM4 with a 20,800mAh battery pack and a microfiber cleaning cloth for $348. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95, so this bundle is valued at around $390. If you don’t care for the battery pack or prefer to shop elsewhere, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863FR3S9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582549-REG%2Fsony_wh1000xm4_b_wh_1000xm4_wireless_noise_canceling_over_ear.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the headphones for $348. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yu5lCJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UfClp3"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like Spatial Audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list while boasting incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that takes opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqkx5j"&gt;At $549, these headphones are expensive, but we’ve been seeing a lot of discounts lately. Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the AirPods Max for $479&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $50 shy of their best price to date and their standard sale price. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Dairpods%2520max%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is offering the same discount but only on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610237-REG%2Fapple_mgym3am_a_airpods_max_pink.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt; models.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones sound great and integrate with Tile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CZefdO"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j2k0rf"&gt;If you’re a non-Apple user looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that sound fantastic, Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 is your best option. We found that they boast detailed, bass-rich sound, a stylish, retro-inspired design, and are extremely comfortable to wear — even when you’re donning glasses. Although their noise cancellation might not rival other models on our list, they make up for it with convenient software features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Plus, unlike many other headphones, they integrate with the location tracking device, Tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TshVIF"&gt;The headphones typically retail for $399.99, but several retailers have been selling them for $241 since Black Friday. Right now, however, only &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fse508234.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; has them for $241 (and only in black). That’s nearly half their usual price, saving you $159. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 are great for multitasking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HLSET"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7ybM"&gt;Multitaskers will appreciate Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 as they offer terrific, reliable multipoint Bluetooth support. You can seamlessly pair them with multiple devices, allowing you to juggle content and switch back and forth at the same time. These headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for volume and noise cancellation, with far better quality and battery life than their predecessor. While the noise canceling isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, they still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slxuWB"&gt;During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to $162.49, which is almost half their typical retail price. We’re not currently seeing any similar big deals on them, but you can still a pair for $230.99 from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-headphones-2%2F8WQ0BSX7G523%2FCS2R%3FOCID%3D%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619711/9383?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphones142022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Headphones-2-Black-Wireless%2F226974951&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 boast excellent voice quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hB20N"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl2BaG"&gt;If you plan to frequently use your headphones for voice calls, Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are the best option on this list for doing so. They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FueOFu"&gt;We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299. Lately, however, we haven’t seen any sales that steep. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5F81JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has been selling them for $379&lt;/a&gt; instead of $399 for the past six months, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-11556694?sid=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fnoise_cancelling_headphones%2Fnoise-cancelling-headphones-700.html%23v%3Dnoise_cancelling_headphones_700_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoJJjLU8c0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the headphones for the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio 3 are nearly half off and thus a good alternative if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eO1gZ8"&gt;Beats Studio 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4X0vv8"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; these to anybody outside of the Apple ecosystem, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless could be a decent alternative if you want a pair of over-ear headphones from Apple but find the AirPods Max to be too expensive. The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which allows you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support. They also charge via a Micro USB port instead of a Lightning port or USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJn2Mp"&gt;They’re certainly showing their age at this point — they launched 2017, after all — but they're currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Headphones-Collection/dp/B08528ZCNX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale starting at $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like newer Bose models, the QuietComfort 35 II are both comfortable and lightweight. They also come with a number of praiseworthy features, including good sound quality and the ability to seamlessly switch between two paired devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lint85"&gt;While their sticker price is $349, the QC35 II are frequently on sale for far less. In fact, until just recently, we saw them for as low as $179. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227753/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is only selling the headphones for around $299, about $30 less than Bose QC45 are currently selling for.&lt;/p&gt;

While its sticker price was $299.95, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp7ZJWzFZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling them in blue and red for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, Apple no longer sells them, and the retailers that do — like Best Buy — are not likely to continue stocking them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ Walkie Talkie feature is now widely available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jsii-FMFc6ChuyogSxMzAQ776hA=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378355/microsoftteamswalkietalkie.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emp3I5"&gt;Microsoft is making its &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie"&gt;Walkie Talkie feature&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft Teams generally available to all users of its communications app today. Walkie Talkie lets Microsoft Teams users turn smartphones or tablets into a walkie-talkie that works over cellular data or Wi-FI. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058313/microsoft-teams-walkie-talkie-push-to-talk-feature-preview"&gt;originally announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and has been available mostly in preview ever since. The feature &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-september-2020/ba-p/1726562"&gt;launched widely on Android in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but now Microsoft says it’s available for Zebra mobile devices as well as iPhones and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeAw8t"&gt;Microsoft has primarily pitched this at frontline workers, employees who are customer-facing and run day-to-day operations inside companies. The software maker’s collaboration with Zebra Technologies makes it work with a dedicated push-to-talk button for quick and secure communications. These devices are used widely by frontline workers, the employees that have helped steer the world through the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zuxSAahi5_6eXuKogswLurjdd94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163138/Walkie_talkie_on_Zebra_image.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walkie Talkie on Zebra devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kjEEza"&gt;Walkie-talkie features are still rare in communications apps. WhatsApp lets you record snippets of audio than can be sent and received, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;Slack launched its Discord-like Huddles feature&lt;/a&gt; last year to let people drop in and out of calls easily. Apple did launch its own walkie-talkie feature on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17428180/walkie-talkie-apple-watch-facetime-audio-wwdc-2028"&gt;Apple Watch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, using push-to-talk over a FaceTime Audio call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9n7Tl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 14th, 6:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said the walkie-talkie feature has been in preview ever since it was announced. In fact, it launched in general availability on Android devices in late 2020. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is now requiring office workers to get weekly molecular COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is implementing new policies as COVID-19 cases rise across the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVBhzE"&gt;Google will require anyone going to one of its US offices or facilities to have received a negative molecular test for COVID-19, the company informed employees Thursday in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/google-tells-anyone-coming-into-the-office-to-take-weekly-covid-tests.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;memo obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Workers going to the office regularly will have to get tested weekly, chief health officer Karen DeSalvo said in the memo, and employees have been asked to report their vaccination status&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and wear surgical-grade masks indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IxE4l"&gt;Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a new temporary COVID-19 policy is now being implemented, one where “anyone accessing our sites in the US are expected to obtain a recent negative COVID-19 molecular test before coming onsite” and that it’s offering various kinds of tests at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kHOOB4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google offers at-home tests for employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBQlrt"&gt;Google offers free at-home testing to full-time employees and contract workers through BioIQ’s PCR-based nasal swab tests, Erickson said, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/google-staff-get-pricey-fast-covid-tests-while-contractors-wait"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that full-time employees also have access to molecular tests from Cue Health that can give results in just a few minutes. Contractors, on the other hand, are specifically being offered the mail-in BioIQ tests, according to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1480987095174766593"&gt;tweet from the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must wait longer for a result. Erickson tells us that some Google contractors at the company’s datacenters have access to rapid on-site testing using the Cue machines, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9BrsM"&gt;The changes arrive as COVID-19 cases have surged across the country and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/who-says-omicron-cases-are-off-the-charts-as-global-infections-set-new-records.html"&gt;as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/a&gt;. These new policies add to Google’s directive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;from December&lt;/a&gt; requiring employees to get vaccinated or risk being forced to take leave and eventually be fired. The company delayed its mandatory return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;to some point this year&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi4zls"&gt;This week, Meta also upped its health policies for employees, requiring anyone returning to its offices when they open at the end of March to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;received a booster dose of a vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s AI-powered scaling makes old games look better without a huge performance hit  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fYS1HiDS4A-eWoRyW7yqN3VweA=/282x0:3332x2033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392269/nvidia_dldsr_ai_deep_learning_dynamic_super_resolution_performance_image_quality_comparison.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia says its AI-powered upscaling is more powerful than regular super-resolution.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XS1j6s"&gt;Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgod-of-war-game-ready-driver%2F%3FlinkId%3D100000103579293&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest game-ready driver&lt;/a&gt; includes a tool that could let you improve the image quality of games that your graphics card can easily run, alongside optimizations for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22883541/god-of-war-pc-port-interview"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; PC port&lt;/a&gt;. The tech is called Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution, or DLDSR, and Nvidia says you can use it to make “most games” look sharper by running them at a higher resolution than your monitor natively supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFBHbr"&gt;DLDSR builds on Nvidia’s Dynamic Super Resolution tech, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6502823/nvidia-and-amd-bring-out-their-big-new-guns-for-the-holidays"&gt;been around for years&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdsr%2Ftechnology%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular old DSR&lt;/a&gt; renders a game at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle and then downscales it to your monitor’s native resolution. This leads to an image with better sharpness but usually comes with a dip in performance (you are asking your GPU to do more work, after all). So, for instance, if you had a graphics card capable of running a game at 4K but only had a 1440p monitor, you could use DSR to get a boost in clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Jyhly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DLDSR takes DSR and adds AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sYMBBU"&gt;DLDSR takes the same concept and incorporates AI that can also work to enhance the image. According to Nvidia, this means you can upscale less (and therefore lose less performance) while still getting similar image quality improvements. In real numbers, Nvidia claims you’ll get image quality similar to running at four times the resolution using DSR with only 2.25 times the resolution with DLDSR. Nvidia gives an example using 2017’s &lt;em&gt;Prey: Digital Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;running on a 1080p monitor:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;4x&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;DSR runs at 108 FPS, while 2.25x DLDSR is getting 143 FPS, only two frames per second slower than running at native 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c74poS"&gt;Of course, you may want to take those impressive results with a grain of salt, as Nvidia’s obviously going to want to show one of the best-case examples. In the real world, you may get different results with different games, both in terms of FPS and what settings you have to run DLDSR in to get it looking crisp. Given its wider game support, though, you’ll probably be able to play around with it using one of your favorite older titles  — though you still will need an RTX card, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;aren’t exactly easy to get right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMRAju"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia has had a lot of success with deep learning lately&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDRFfH"&gt;This isn’t the first time Nvidia’s used deep learning to improve image quality and performance — it’s gotten a lot of praise for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics"&gt;its Deep Learning Super Sampling&lt;/a&gt;, or DLSS, system. However, DLSS needs to be specifically supported by the game, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdlss%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list of games you can use it with&lt;/a&gt; is relatively small (though, as of today, it includes the &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpq6KD"&gt;AMD, Nvidia’s graphics card competitor, has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866673/amd-radeon-super-resolution-software-ai-super-sampling-ces-2022"&gt;announced tech to improve performance and graphics&lt;/a&gt; on a wide array of games. It calls its approach Radeon Super Resolution, and while it doesn’t use exactly the same methods as DLSS or DLDSR (AMD has its own upscaling tech called &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/vsr"&gt;virtual super resolution&lt;/a&gt;), it’s aiming towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGvsGT"&gt;If you want to try out Nvidia’s DLDSR, update to the latest driver, then open up Nvidia Control Panel app. Go to Manage 3D Settings, click the DSR - Factors drop-down, and select one of the DL Scaling options.&lt;/p&gt;
