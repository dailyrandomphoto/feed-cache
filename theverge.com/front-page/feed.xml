    <title>FDA clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 to 15</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UER19F"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can now be administered to 12- to 15-year-olds, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use"&gt;Food and Drug Administration announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the shot was authorized for people 16 years of age and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBKN8c"&gt;The companies asked the FDA to expand the authorization to include the new ages in early April, just after they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359883/covid-vaccine-pfizer-adolescents-effective"&gt;released data&lt;/a&gt; showing that their vaccine was highly effective for that group. All of the 12- to 15-year-olds given the two-dose vaccine in a small study generated strong antibody response with no serious side effects, and none developed COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9CxxH"&gt;The United States will likely need to vaccinate kids and teenagers to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic — the expanded authorization is another step toward &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/opinion/covid-vaccines-kids.html"&gt;that goal&lt;/a&gt;. Although kids are less likely to get seriously sick from COVID-19 than adults, they can still catch the virus and suffer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/health/covid-children-inflammatory-syndrome.html"&gt;long-term symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. If they’re infected with the virus, they can also pass it along to others, so vaccinating kids is a way to stop them from getting family members or others sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkSzpp"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech also have studies in progress testing their COVID-19 vaccine in younger age groups, starting with infants six months old. Moderna, which has a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for people 18 years and older, is testing its shot in children and adolescents aged six months through 17 years old. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has plans for similar studies, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQJs17"&gt;152,819,904 people in the US have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVwbUt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony now lets you use the DualSense pad to play PS5 on your nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn7yKyzSC-ZnTSHtZKmvKXzkscw=/0x212:2200x1679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265140/20210510_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtiSeS"&gt;It’s a little-known fact that you can sling a PS5 or PS4 to another room of your house, streaming your games to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138016/playstation-4-remote-play-pc-mac-feature"&gt;Mac or Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902406/sony-ps4-firmware-update-remote-play-android"&gt;iOS or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;or even an old PS4&lt;/a&gt; with Sony’s PS Remote Play app. But until recently, you could only remotely control your shiny new PlayStation 5 with the old DualShock 4 gamepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dloisn"&gt;That’s now changing, as Sony has just announced the PS5’s new DualShock controller is supported &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/"&gt;across every Apple platform running the latest operating system&lt;/a&gt;, including iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Apple TVs running 14.5 and Macs running macOS Big Sur 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlGGmR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remote Play is now available using the DualSense wireless controller to play compatible games on a range of Apple devices. Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx"&gt;https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z2BlehDLjO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z2BlehDLjO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1391822847924973579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGsa9D"&gt;I just gave it a quick try myself with an iPhone 12 mini and a recent iPad Pro, and I have some thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUleMM"&gt;The good news: if the only controller you own is a DualSense controller, it totally works — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-featuresver"&gt;your awesome adaptive triggers&lt;/a&gt; come along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEuqyp"&gt;Here is some bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0ogOnp"&gt;There’s no haptic feedback. Absolutely zero. It feels extremely weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="izZOmp"&gt;Each time you want to switch devices (to your iPhone or back to your PS5), you’ll have to manually pair your DualSense again. That was true of previous pads as well, but I was hoping they’d fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QMN2GW"&gt;The built-in microphone, headphone jack, and speaker don’t work. The speaker is a serious loss — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;games like&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;use it in combination with haptic feedback to add some serious immersion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HV1yCY"&gt;The streaming quality, as always, will depend heavily on your home wireless network. Give it a try, though; it’s free! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EbHy"&gt;You’ll have to decide whether these things defeat the purpose of pairing a DualSense with an Apple device. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep my DualSense hooked up to the PS5 where it can actually help me sense things, and use a DualShock 4 (or third-party pad) when I want to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM77R2"&gt;It’s also more ammunition for the argument that we should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;play PS5 games on our PS5 with a PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second time Sony has shown that limitation is totally arbitrary: first when it allowed us to &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-play-ps5-games-with-a-dualshock-4-if-you-use-remote-play/'"&gt;control PS5 games with the PS4 controller over Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; to start, and now again with this signal that the DualSense’s sensing abilities are optional when streaming games over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A special thanks to the person who combined the Apple TV remote and an AirTag</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5koe4"&gt;Here are a few unrelated facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aQ7mJV"&gt;Up until few weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;Apple was selling the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the least popular (and most easily lost) remote controls ever made, with a slick glass and metal chassis that’s practically designed to slip behind a couch cushion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="urzuRn"&gt;Apple also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released its AirTag trackers&lt;/a&gt;, which use a Bluetooth network of Apple devices and local ultra-wideband tracking to help locate missing items, whether they’re across town or a few feet away in the room with you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G827Fn"&gt;The AirTag tracker has a small speaker, so you can find it buried in a couch or under a pile of throw pillows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLzRgk"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which it announced at the same event as the AirTags trackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IT482B"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394335/apple-u1-uwb-locator-missing-ipad-pro-apple-tv-siri-remote"&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt; a UWB chip in the new Siri Remote to allow users with recent iPhone devices to track said remote if they manage to lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u0lcDd"&gt;Apple is a company that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fcases-protection&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;produces cases&lt;/a&gt; for almost all of its products (including the iPhone, iPad, and AirTag tracker) — but not either iteration of the Siri Remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0qE35"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208492"&gt;Apple’s official support document&lt;/a&gt; for “If you lost the remote for your Apple TV,” advocates that users either use the Apple TV remote function integrated into iOS devices or just buy a new one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKO9Wj"&gt;My Apple TV remote is &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in my living room, and no, I don’t have any idea where it is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NGU6xw"&gt;With all that said, it’s no surprise that enterprising creators are already making 3D-printed templates for a case for the original Siri Remote that allows you to slot in both the remote and an AirTag tracker so that you can actually find it the next time you lose it in a couch. There are already &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=airtag+remote&amp;amp;type=things&amp;amp;sort=relevant"&gt;several available from Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1015765067%2Fairtag-case-for-apple-tv-siri-remote%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_us_e-electronics_and_accessories-electronics_cases-phone_cases%26utm_custom1%3D_k_Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB_k_%26utm_content%3Dgo_1843970791_69629621997_346364498394_pla-352374535867_c__1015765067_12768591%26utm_custom2%3D1843970791%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy store selling files&lt;/a&gt;, and even an enterprising &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224454921320%3Fchn%3Dps%26var%3D523239022404%26norover%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-117182-37290-0%26mkcid%3D2%26itemid%3D523239022404_224454921320%26targetid%3D882300791467%26device%3Dc%26mktype%3Dpla%26googleloc%3D9003653%26poi%3D%26campaignid%3D1669934603%26mkgroupid%3D65058347419%26rlsatarget%3Dpla-882300791467%26abcId%3D1123856%26merchantid%3D6296724%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIaUm-mnPxWXR9m6x20Zn9U11qEZG6mxRRI2zzO51zF1CKHnRApJT8MaAuBzEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; that’ll print and ship you one if you don’t have a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ6vMH"&gt;To be clear, this is the lamest workaround for the fact that Apple didn’t just put a UWB chip and a tiny speaker in its $60 remote. It can’t be a cost thing: AirTags have one and they only cost $30. Roku has been putting tiny speakers in its remotes to make them easier to find for years. There was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/29/siris-find-my-support-apple-tv-remote/"&gt;even a strange message&lt;/a&gt; in Siri that seemed to hint at the possibility of finding a lost Siri Remote using the virtual assistant — but Apple removed the message a few hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nuqmlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5LvK"&gt;As such, I cannot explain why Apple has refused to embark down this mind-bogglingly obvious path. But I am puzzled why Apple isn’t making a nicer version of this exact 3D printed concept (ideally out of nicer, more durable materials that actually match the rest of the hardware and would be more enjoyable to use on a daily basis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbH7UO"&gt;Apple loves selling unnecessary hardware accessories (like its various AirTag keychain cases, which cost more than the AirTags and solve the self-inflicted issue of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;not having a loop built right into the device&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTzobV"&gt;For Apple, it’s a no-brainer to make a case (that adds functionality that Apple should have included right out of the box) that would almost certainly exceed the cost of the remote &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; require the additional purchase of a different Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAWPhg"&gt;And yet, for all my mockery here, I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s Autopilot may not have been available at the time of the ‘driverless’ Texas crash </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdhnTiuBMI0Pfx9dn0PHp1EDRH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264548/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GEb8xZ"&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY21FH007-preliminary-report.pdf"&gt;two-page preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;deadly crash of a Tesla Model S in Texas last month&lt;/a&gt; in which local authorities said there was no one in the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm77OV"&gt;There are several relevant disclosures in the NTSB report. The first is that security camera footage from the owner’s home captured the owner entering the driver’s side door, while his companion got in on the passenger side. The car leaves the house, travels 550 feet before departing the road on a curve, hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole, and a tree. The car then burst into flames, killing the two occupants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5yJH4t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8iOon"&gt;The second relevant finding is that NTSB crash investigators tested whether Tesla’s advanced driver assist system Autopilot would work on the part of the road where the crash took place. There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers as to whether Autopilot would even function on the road near the crash site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZexsXz"&gt;Using Autopilot requires both the Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (Tesla’s brand name for its adaptive cruise control function) and Autosteer (which assists in lane departure and centering) to work. According to NTSB, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control could be engaged but not Autosteer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54d817"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;Tesla claims&lt;/a&gt; that its own data suggests local officials were mistaken when they reported that the car crashed without someone in the driver’s seat. The company’s executives have stated that the steering wheel was “deformed” and the seatbelts were buckled, leading them to conclude that someone was behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIMl4E"&gt;There was some limited data recovered from the crash. NTSB said the fire destroyed the onboard storage device located in the vehicle’s infotainment console. The restraint control module, which records data associated with vehicle speed, belt status, acceleration, and airbag deployment, was recovered but was also damaged by the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="76Vaf4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt85Nc"&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year. By comparison, the NTSB’s investigation into a California man’s death while using Autopilot in his Tesla Model X took two years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85ILAL"&gt;The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple suppliers linked to Uyghur forced labor in new report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoKq-dY5VONuf34LH0rcbAS_z6k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264431/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fseven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428899%2Fapple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often moved far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl0OY3"&gt;One of the suppliers operated in Xinjiang, the region of China predominantly populated by Uyghurs and where the most egregious human rights violations &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/inside-xinjiang-detention-camp"&gt;have reportedly taken place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL5Jyw"&gt;The companies supplied Apple with antennas, cables, and coatings, among other products and services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glfQLl"&gt;Apple “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Apple said it looks for forced labor as part of “every assessment” it conducts. “We will continue doing all we can to protect workers and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgJ34z"&gt;The problem is not Apple’s alone. The tech industry at large relies on suppliers in China, and &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that these companies have also worked with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among others. (Amazon and Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; they wouldn’t work with suppliers using forced labor; Google and Microsoft didn’t respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeynMT"&gt;China’s forced work programs have been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;getting more attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, with new reports speaking to the growing scope of China’s oppressive practices in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; finding more than 100 detention facilities located beside factories.  In January, &lt;a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html"&gt;the Trump administration said&lt;/a&gt; China was “committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcbbAE"&gt;Apple’s supply chain has previously been linked to forced labor in China. The Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;said a glass supplier&lt;/a&gt; was using forced labor in December; Apple said it had seen no evidence of forced labor. In March, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/shares-of-china-s-ofilm-drop-after-firm-loses-foreign-customer"&gt;cut ties with another supplier&lt;/a&gt; over allegations it was connected to coercive government labor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook wants to make sure you’ve read the article you’re about to share</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68e7momSmK79BvJ29oJAdkeC9SU=/136x0:1756x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264427/E1C5TYUWEAo0YiK.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FaceBook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80hZFr"&gt;Facebook has announced on Twitter that it will start testing a pop-up that asks users if they’re sure they want to share an article that they haven’t opened. The pop-up will prompt users to read the article, but they can also choose to continue sharing it if they want. A Facebook spokesperson said the test would be rolled out to 6 percent of Android users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3uXD"&gt;The pop-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;is similar to Twitter’s&lt;/a&gt;, which it started testing in June 2020. Twitter’s implementation of the feature can be annoying to users (myself included) who have read the article elsewhere and decide to share it when they see it pop up on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjXWWf"&gt;Facebook says the pop-up is meant to help people be more informed about the articles they share, likely as an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551906/facebook-election-results-misinformation-violence-incitement-trends"&gt;has struggled with in the past&lt;/a&gt;. As the message warns, not opening the article can lead to “missing key facts,” with headlines often not telling the whole story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FRAjeo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re testing a way to promote more informed sharing of news articles. If you go to share a news article link you haven’t opened, we’ll show a prompt encouraging you to open it and read it, before sharing it with others. &lt;a href="https://t.co/brlMnlg6Qg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/brlMnlg6Qg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1391816265891778560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline hackers apologize, promise to ransom less controversial targets in future</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vT3M71"&gt;The group behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;ransomware that took down Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; late last week &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/white-house-creates-task-force-to-deal-with-pipeline-breach?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;has apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences,” claiming that its goal is to make money, not cause societal problems. The group is called DarkSide, and &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-compromise-of-colonial-pipeline-networks"&gt;the FBI has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the group’s malware was responsible for compromising one of the US’s largest fuel pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVx5G2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzzez/colonial-pipeline-hackers-statement-darkside"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the group’s apology was posted to its dark web site. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8WgclL"&gt;We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, &lt;strong&gt;do not need&lt;/strong&gt; to tie us with a defined government and look for other our motives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph7GhI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIWixH"&gt;From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg1wFa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1391794316507418624"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth&lt;/a&gt;, DarkSide isn’t necessarily associated with a specific nationstate, but it does tend to avoid holding victims for ransom if their systems are running in certain Russian and Eastern European languages (see embedded tweet below). &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/white-house-creates-task-force-to-deal-with-pipeline-breach"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the group is known to speak Russian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IPbZ03"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The assumption is that Darkside is not nation state affiliated, but like oh-so-many ransomware groups it uses tools like “GetUserDefaultLangID” to perform language checks. If the victim uses any languages below, DarkSide moves on. &lt;a href="https://t.co/atMjKSPAJl"&gt;https://t.co/atMjKSPAJl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LNJ0CBDdBo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LNJ0CBDdBo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicole Perlroth (@nicoleperlroth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1391794316507418624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="4ZHHHw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 5,500-mile-long Colonial Pipeline is responsible for carrying 45 percent of the fuel for the Eastern US, including jet fuel and gas. The company that runs the pipeline &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/colonial-says-parts-of-fuel-pipeline-being-brought-online-aims-to-restore-service-by-end-of-week.html"&gt;has put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that it’s currently bringing parts of its system back online, after halting all operations due to the cyberattack. Colonial Pipeline says its goal is to restore service by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson spins out LiveWire as its own electric motorcycle brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuDm4MSafaLkT7zDmLsYb317Gr4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264340/harley_davidson_livewire_2497.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AeZiTC"&gt;LiveWire, the first electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson, will now become its own standalone brand. The Milwaukee-based company announced that it would be spinning out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172421/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-price-ces-2019"&gt;electric motorcycle division&lt;/a&gt; as its own company with a distinct lineup and a tailored retail experience. Harley-Davidson plans to unveil the “first LiveWire branded motorcycle” on July 8th to coincide with the International Motorcycle Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v9piF"&gt;It’s a similar move to how Harley-Davidson approached its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;new electric bicycle company, Serial 1&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that LiveWire continues to benefit from its relationship with its parent company while also forging its own brand identity that is distinct from Harley-Davidson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiBVgY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Harley-Davidson is interested in letting its electrified models stand on their own terms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfsiAO"&gt;It’s a shift from how the company approached its current LiveWire model, in which the Harley-Davidson logo is front and center, while the LiveWire brand is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692388/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-test-drive"&gt;practically nonexistent&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s a sign that going forward, Harley-Davidson is interested in letting its electrified models stand on their own terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e2LcZ"&gt;“With the mission to be the most desirable electric motorcycle brand in the world, LiveWire will pioneer the future of motorcycling, for the pursuit of urban adventure and beyond,” Jochen Zeitz, chairman, president, and CEO of Harley-Davidson, said in a statement. “LiveWire also plans to innovate and develop technology that will be applicable to Harley-Davidson electric motorcycles in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oj7upFuTMLjIrIytH908nZF8v08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504479/3_LiveWire_Black_CMYK_PRIMARY_LOCKUP.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SS4KX6"&gt;There’s a new logo and a new “virtual” headquarters, with engineering teams stationed in Silicon Valley and Milwaukee. LiveWire will work with Harley-Davidson dealerships as an independent brand, with a blend of digital and physical retail formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdrrBe"&gt;Asked whether this will include online ordering, a Harley-Davidson spokesperson responded with a cautiously worded statement. “It depends on the state in which you live,” the spokesperson said. “LiveWire is creating a purchase path that allows us to meet the expectations for a digital-first purchase experience, supported by a network of committed dealers that allow customers to choose their path and engagement model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfrJJB"&gt;The question is whether this branding strategy will lead to better sales for Harley-Davidson’s electric models. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-electricbike-focus/harley-struggles-to-fire-up-new-generation-of-riders-with-electric-bike-debut-idUSKBN1WM10N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s plan to appeal to a younger generation of motorcyclists with the LiveWire was struggling, with most of the preorders coming from older or preexisting customers. Harley-Davidson’s overall sales have been stagnant lately after hitting a low point in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IwDlC"&gt;The problem could be that the price, which starts at $29,799, isn’t that much cheaper than a Tesla Model 3. Dealers told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;that many younger customers were turned off by the price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVKmE6"&gt;Harley-Davidson is also facing some stiff competition from rivals like Zero Motorcycles, which recently teamed up with power sports manufacturer Polaris on a new lineup of electric-powered ATVs and snowmobiles. And as the broader world of transportation shifts to electric, the company will be under increasing pressure from its shareholders to prove its vision for the future can be profitable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has run the numbers to see how vloggers open their videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HjqD1R5jYjt_vZXO6oJ4NDaLwUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264132/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2b8UnS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;YouTube has run the numbers&lt;/a&gt; and discovered what greeting its vloggers most use to open videos: “Hey, guys.” Those findings may not be surprising if you’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the report actually shows a lot more, including what the runners-up are, how greetings have changed in popularity over time, and how video genre affects the most common openings. Let’s just jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRxQVj"&gt;To get these findings, YouTube did quite a bit of data analysis, looking at the auto- and creator-generated captions from over a million videos. YouTube picked videos that had over 20,000 views from channels that had over 20,000 subscribers, so it is worth noting that the results are more reflective of how relatively popular videos open, rather than of every single video on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTOOlBTlhg5z-ukWLhW8C8S7170=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504241/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.05.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The runners-up have changed over time, but “Hey, guys” has always been dominant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNiKuG"&gt;YouTube also breaks down how creators of different genres open their videos. For example, sports videos are way more likely to start with “What’s going on?” while travel videos start with a “Good morning” 9 percent of the time. “Hey, guys” comes in second for opening tech videos, with “Ladies and gentlemen” barely edging it out (though I do prefer &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i09V6SkVkz8?t=46"&gt;Tom Scott’s&lt;/a&gt; “Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErESGkQHEuG5rtKgeElr11hdpxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504243/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.34.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There sure are some outliers here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuBeG"&gt;The article also takes a look at international greetings from Brazilian, French, German, and Mexican creators. Surprisingly, only one has a phrase in the top spot that translates to “Hey, guys,” making it seem like more of an English-speaking opening than a global one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co16-ezXisx7CloZ_d9LidhJ_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504222/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.22.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Coucou tout le monde” is how I’m greeting everyone from now on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBHviN"&gt;To play around with the interactive timeline of greetings for yourself (and get a look at some famous channel openings from the infamous “Hey VSauce, Michael here” to “What’s up, Greg?”), you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;head over to YouTube’s article&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it’ll do a breakdown of how people end their videos next so I can get a good idea of how I should be ending these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
