    <title>Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyyVPOyR-LKOLEQSzv0Lb2MUIQw=/30x0:2610x1720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112364/Udelv_Driven_by_Mobileye_night.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhdxCh"&gt;Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQP6q0"&gt;Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3sCG3"&gt;“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0Z5wy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a real commercial deployment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKb4N4"&gt;Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ90MT"&gt;The company is also testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities&lt;/a&gt; around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sZLzJ"&gt;“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bpvIX"&gt;Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvDBXf"&gt;The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506125/einride-self-driving-truck-pod-aet-reveal"&gt;Einride&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SLZNKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0kIv3h"&gt;Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgIeYX"&gt;While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhzrHU"&gt;That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmAe0D"&gt;“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft buys AI speech tech company Nuance for $19.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft logo stock 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2xd47oiKf3dDVrVBs61TM5m8dQ=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112249/microsoftlogostock1_1020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaDsZe"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/"&gt;buying AI speech tech firm Nuance for $19.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant’s prowess in voice recognition and giving it further leverage in the health care market, where Nuance sells many products. Microsoft will pay $56 per share for Nuance, a 23 percent premium over the company’s closing price last Friday. The deal includes Nuance’s net debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWrE7z"&gt;Nuance is best known for its Dragon software, which uses deep learning to transcribe speech and improves its accuracy over time by adapting to a user’s voice. Nuance has licensed this tech for many services and applications, including, most famously, Apple’s digital assistant Siri. (Though to what degree Siri currently relies on Dragon to answer users’ queries is unclear.) Dragon is an industry leader in terms of transcription accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fabTd"&gt;The $19.7 billion acquisition of Nuance is Microsoft’s second-largest behind its purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 for $26 billion. It comes at a time when speech tech is improving rapidly, thanks to the deep learning boom in AI, and there are simultaneously more opportunities for its use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zBEx4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Digital transcription has improved rapidly in recent years, thanks to advances in AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELAYEM"&gt;Digital transcription has become more reliable in a range of settings, from medical consultations to board meetings and university lectures. The uptick in remote work has also created new opportunities. With so many meetings taking place via video, it is easier to offer customers transcriptions via software integrated directly into these calls. Zoom, for example, offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;automatic transcription&lt;/a&gt; via integration with third-party services like Otter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hhsj3s"&gt;For Microsoft, which makes roughly two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise software sales and cloud computing, improving its transcription services for scenarios like these makes complete sense. The company could integrate Nuance’s technology into its existing software, like Teams, or offer it independently as part of its Azure cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klm9uJ"&gt;The immediate focus, though, will be on health care, where the two companies have already worked together. &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/nuance-exam-room-of-the-future/"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, they announced a “strategic partnership” to use Nuance’s software to digitize health records for Microsoft’s clients. Nuance’s health tech, including its Dragon Medical One platform, which is tuned to identify medical terminology, is reportedly used by more than half a million physicians worldwide and in 77 percent of US hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vibdWE"&gt;“By augmenting the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare with Nuance’s solutions, as well as the benefit of Nuance’s expertise and relationships with EHR systems providers, Microsoft will be better able to empower healthcare providers through the power of ambient clinical intelligence and other Microsoft cloud services,” said Microsoft in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVS7WO"&gt;“Nuance provides the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery and is a pioneer in the real-world application of enterprise AI,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzzcRi"&gt;News of the Nuance acquisition was first reported over the weekend by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s the latest example of Microsoft’s purchasing spree. Last month, the company completed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;$7.5 billion acquisition of games company&lt;/a&gt; ZeniMax. Last year, it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;considering an acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of social video app TikTok, and the company is also reportedly in “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;exclusive talks&lt;/a&gt;” to purchase communications app Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot has been taught to pee beer on command</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yT93Vb9vbniBMJbrcEmkiESLolQ=/59x0:542x322/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112240/spot_pee_beer.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="arLwyn"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot exists in two realities. In one, it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;terrifying harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of a dystopian future when robots hunt and kill humans. In the other, it’s the plaything of YouTubers who &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tqsy9Wtr1qE"&gt;teach this robot quadruped&lt;/a&gt; to “piss beer” on command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lz3Lel"&gt;The latter example comes from the talented, imaginative, piss-focused YouTuber Michael Reeves, who managed to get his hands on a unit before using his tech expertise and dirty mind to turn Spot into the ultimate drinking buddy. With some quick code and a few feet of tubing, Spot can identify cups on the floor, position itself over them, and release a stream of &lt;s&gt;piss&lt;/s&gt; beer into the awaiting receptacle. It’s the future Isaac Asimov could only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDnLEU"&gt;As Reeves notes in the video, it’s hardly a polished product. “Piss bot is working flawlessly. 35 percent of the time,” he says. But it’s still an absolutely amazing thing to make.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z9d6gQrra9oF7HtGLSaPBAtxYtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437703/spot_pee_beer.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video by Michael Reeves / YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A little wide of the mark there, Spot, but everyone makes mistakes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b7J3T9"&gt;Now, just to put on my “I’m a journalist, and I like to overthink things” hat for a second: what also fascinates me about this video is what it means for Boston Dynamics. This is a firm that has previously worked to tightly control footage of its machines and their public reception. Since making Spot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;commercially available&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s had to relinquish some of this control, leading to instances where its machinery is used in ways it doesn’t approve of (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295091/mschf-drop-boston-dynamics-spot-paintball-gun-art-gallery"&gt;equipping Spot with a paintball gun&lt;/a&gt;). This includes non-jokey military uses. When we reported on the French army using Spot in simulated combat exercises &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, Boston Dynamics told us it was unaware these particular tests were being carried out (though it did know the French military had access to its machines). Is greater access to Spot going to create more problems for the company in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2FJUL"&gt;Spot is definitely not easy to get a hold of. It costs $75,000 for one. But it’s plainly much more accessible than it was a year ago. That has the potential to not only create PR headaches for Boston Dynamics but also genuine enforcement issues. How much visibility does the company have over its robots and how they’re being used? What happens if someone uses it in the wrong way? This doesn’t have to be malicious for people to get hurt. I, for one, cringed watching Reeves grapple with Spot by putting his hands &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the machine’s joints at around the 12-minute mark. Those are called “pinch points” for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVaDUk"&gt;So right now, Spot exists in two realities: as a threat and as a joke. What happens if the line between them blurs? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flappy Bird clone hacked into playable macOS push notification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07-hKgcJXAJlQCnfNrD3PxsoCD0=/151x0:2310x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112203/msedge_L9EISOzg3c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video shows the game playable in a push notification.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJnCPF"&gt;In a new video, a developer has shown off a playable version of viral hit &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS push notification. It’s the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;, who previously &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/mac-pong-on-a-dock-icon-is-cute-as-hell"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; with a clip of &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS app icon. The hack has yet to receive a public release, but it’s still a neat proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIC5Ez"&gt;According to Sardesai, the feature works by loading a web version of the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380942741224484871"&gt;into the notification&lt;/a&gt;. This playable version is technically a browser-based clone of the original app &lt;a href="https://playcanv.as/p/2OlkUaxF/"&gt;made by Will Eastcott of PlayCanvas&lt;/a&gt;. Sardesai notes that the feature relies on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649830175932421"&gt;UserNotificationsUI framework&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Apple with macOS Big Sur, though he says it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1381008674060177418"&gt;should also work on iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enCvwY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know you can put a whole game inside of a push notification &lt;a href="https://t.co/LlMx2AjvHH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LlMx2AjvHH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neil Sardesai (@neilsardesai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RoN6H7"&gt;Distracting notifications are bad enough when you’re trying to get some work done, but combining them with a playable version of an infamously addictive game is the final straw. Sardesai doesn’t appear to have released his work publicly for anyone to try out, which is probably a good thing for the sake of our sanity. After all, the last thing humanity needs right now is for our devices to be able to compel us to play several rounds of &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; with just a simple notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxYSuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt;’s addictive nature was cited by its developer as one of the reasons he removed it from the App Store after it became a hit in 2014. “It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,” Dong Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"&gt;said in an interview at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Although the original game is gone from the App Store, numerous clones have surfaced in its wake, including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761627/flappy-royale-bird-fortnite-battle-mobile-gaming-developers"&gt;excellent battle royale version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing an Apple TV with a built-in camera and speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm0pc9afyC78oZ3WRjASjHfdkLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111969/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K, released in 2017.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnHWwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon’s Echo Show or Google’s Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekAI8e"&gt;The unannounced TV accessory would have the hardware to fulfill a variety of roles. As a TV accessory it could offer access to games and the streaming video services supported by Apple TV today; while its built-in speaker would likely be an upgrade over those found in most TV sets, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. It would also support HomePod features like music playback and Siri voice assistant controls, much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637225/sonos-google-assistant-how-to-set-up-one-beam-home"&gt;Sonos Beam offers&lt;/a&gt; with Alexa and Google Assistant. Finally, the camera would let it serve as a video calling device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;like a Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt; TV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s potentially a lot of functionality in a single Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AbEOj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HomePod, Apple TV, and video conferencing device in one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JFsFd"&gt;The second device is a smart display similar to what competitors Amazon and Google already offer, combining features of an iPad and HomePod. Apple’s work on the device was previously &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG#lazy-img-370126915:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20developing%20new,such%20a%20launch%20isn%E2%80%99t%20imminent.%20Apple"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. Like the TV accessory, this device would also offer video chat features, but via its built-in screen rather than a connected TV. Apple is said to have explored using a robotic arm to rotate the display and track users, similar to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;2020 Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0wj9z"&gt;While Apple’s existing smart home devices have focused on one or two key areas, the functionality offered by the two rumored devices would be much broader. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple merged its HomePod and Apple TV engineering groups in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BZsva"&gt;Apple’s smart home lineup could use a shot in the arm. The company hasn’t updated its Apple TV hardware lineup since 2017, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;discontinued its high-end HomePod&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. A hardware update for the Apple TV has been rumored &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;for several months now&lt;/a&gt;, and recently discovered code suggests it might include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Facebook loophole is allowing politicians around the world to fake support and criticize opponents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyWw5XgJWLiqQUhyDOAT7UQGZzQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111943/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BFYXIc"&gt;Governments and politicians around the world are using a loophole in how Facebook polices inauthentic activity to fake popular support and harass opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKVoQV"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-loophole-state-backed-manipulation"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on internal documents and the testimony of a former Facebook data scientist, Sophie Zhang, shows how the company selectively chooses to take action on this activity. Facebook moves swiftly to deal with coordinated campaigns to sway politics in wealthy countries like the US, South Korea, and Taiwan, while it de-prioritizes or simply ignores reports of similar activity in poorer nations like Afghanistan, Iraq, Mexico, and much of Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyNdNe"&gt;“There is a lot of harm being done on Facebook that is not being responded to because it is not considered enough of a PR risk to Facebook,” Zhang told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “The cost isn’t borne by Facebook. It’s borne by the broader world as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lFEEC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cost isn’t borne by Facebook. It’s borne by the broader world as a whole.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98pYwc"&gt;The loophole identified by Zhang concerns the use of Pages to create fake supporters used by governments to appear popular and criticize opponents. Although Facebook bans people from operating more than one account, any individual can create multiple Pages with similar results. Pages are usually used to represent businesses, charities, nonprofits, or other organizations, but can easily be changed to look like individual accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4IYwR"&gt;One case utilizing this loophole took place in Honduras, where administrators operating the Facebook page of the country’s president, Juan Orlando Hernández, created hundreds of Pages to like their own posts and create the appearance of popular support. (The election of Hernández in 2017 was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/honduras-election-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-declared-winner-amid-unrest"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for fraud.) Similarly, in Azerbaijan, which has experienced years of authoritarian rule under President Ilham Aliyev, the ruling party used dummy Pages to harass opposition politicians and criticize news stories by independent outlets. The video below from &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; shows how these operations work: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CE2YFg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYigm8R2ep8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8YPuP"&gt;Zhang, who worked on Facebook’s integrity team to identify such fake activity, was fired by Facebook in September 2020 for poor performance. In a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo"&gt;memo she shared on her final day&lt;/a&gt;, she described how she’d found “multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O53Eo5"&gt;When Zhang reported such networks of fake Pages to her managers, Facebook’s response was inconsistent. The company was slow in responding to some reports (it took “nearly a year” to remove the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/07/removing-cib-thailand-russia-ukraine-honduras/"&gt;Honduras network&lt;/a&gt; and 14 months to take down the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-september-report/"&gt;Azerbaijan campaign&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;) and ignored others Zhang found, e.g. in Bolivia and Albania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9fIEL"&gt;As Facebook’s vice-president of integrity, Guy Rosen, told Zhang in 2019 after she complained about slow responses: “We have literally hundreds or thousands of types of abuse (job security on integrity eh!) [...] That’s why we should start from the end (top countries, top priority areas, things driving prevalence, etc) and try to somewhat work our way down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBs4Vy"&gt;In order to speak out about Facebook’s inaction, Zhang turned down a $64,000 severance package with the company. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518093898289153"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; this morning accompanying the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;’s investigation, Zhang said: “I joined FB because I’d naively hoped to fix the company from within. I am coming forward, because I failed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxOoez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Facebook is not my enemy. In the end, their goal - like that of any corporation - is profit. We cannot expect them to fix the world out of the goodness of their hearts, any more than expecting Philip Morris to make cancer-free cigarettes. &lt;br&gt;Instead, we hold them responsible. (4/8)&lt;/p&gt;— Sophie Zhang（张学菲） (@szhang_ds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518201855430657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8ceR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And we also hold responsible the politicians who chose to abuse Facebook to manipulate their own populace. &lt;br&gt;I caught two national governments red-handed without any effort, knowing nothing about their country beyond Google and Wikipedia. Because they never bothered to hide. (5/8)&lt;/p&gt;— Sophie Zhang（张学菲） (@szhang_ds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/szhang_ds/status/1381518320474615814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="celYB3"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian, &lt;/em&gt;Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said: “We fundamentally disagree with Ms Zhang’s characterization of our priorities and efforts to root out abuse on our platform. We aggressively go after abuse around the world and have specialized teams focused on this work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9BnN7"&gt;Bourgeois says Facebook has taken down “more than 100 networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior” and that “combatting coordinated inauthentic behavior is our priority.” The company did not dispute the facts of Zhang’s time working at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise is bringing its driverless robotaxis to Dubai in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHIudg_UXdeXPe5Q-Eg5gwidyrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111722/vpavic_200121_3874_0010.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NyNpXZ"&gt;Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company backed by General Motors and Honda, will launch its first international robotaxi service in Dubai. The company will start testing its vehicles in the kingdom in 2023, with plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service soon after — though it hasn’t specified an actual date. The news was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HamdanMohammed/status/1381541036028125184"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; early Monday by Dubai’s crown prince, Hamdan bin Mohammed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7TS9Q"&gt;As part of the ride-hailing service, Cruise will use its fully autonomous Origin vehicles, which it first unveiled in 2019. The company does not plan on utilizing its Chevy Bolt electric vehicles that it currently uses as part of its test fleet in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqeOqo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;The Origin is designed&lt;/a&gt; to be a shared vehicle, and when it goes into production, it won’t have any controls typically associated with human driving, like a steering wheel or pedals. Cruise said the goal is to scale up to at least 4,000 vehicles in Dubai by the year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f55jSt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cruise still intends for San Francisco to be its first market for its commercial robotaxi service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVcjxp"&gt;Cruise still intends for San Francisco to be its first market for its commercial robotaxi service. The company had planned to launch a commercial service in its hometown in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but failed to do so&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to announce a new date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwvKzn"&gt;The Cruise Origin will go into production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2022. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative effect on shared ride-hailing, Cruise recently unveiled a new set of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527014/cruise-self-driving-origin-covid-safety-ruls-nhtsa-exemption"&gt;safety protocols&lt;/a&gt; intended to keep people socially distant during trips and the vehicle sanitized between fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A497u2"&gt;Cruise is among the best capitalized autonomous vehicle companies in the world. Over the last three years, the company has raised over $9.25 billion from a number of investors including SoftBank, Honda, GM, T. Rowe Price Group, and Microsoft. Cruise is currently valued at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjy9id"&gt;Dubai may be a natural fit for Cruise’s fully autonomous vehicles. The kingdom has the goal of 20 percent of its trips taking place in autonomous vehicles by 2030. Dubai has also invited a number of urban air mobility companies, like Volocopter,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16365614/dubai-testing-uncrewed-two-person-flying-taxis-volocopter"&gt; to test their electric aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFHa5k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified the Dubai launch plans and corrected the amount invested in Cruise to date. It’s $9.25 billion, not $7.4 billion as originally stated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘Heads Up’ feature nags distracted Android users to look up while walking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bgd1q9RPbx0YyxE0FAV-bXo3GL0=/0x0:1517x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111704/EyrbTZOVoAUnpai.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration from the feature’s settings page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google (via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157364791832579" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Prakash Kamat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IsMLv0"&gt;Android’s Digital Wellbeing service is getting a new “Heads Up” feature, which will prompt users to stop staring at their phones while walking, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/digital-wellbeing-preps-heads-up-stop-you-using-phone-while-walking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature appears to be rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381244945252581380"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of the Digital Wellbeing app, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157095064539137"&gt;one Twitter user&lt;/a&gt; reports receiving the feature on their Pixel 4A device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vDfU2"&gt;“If you’re walking while using your phone, get a reminder to focus on what’s around you,” says the Heads Up setup page. The reminders include brief notifications with instructions like “Watch your step,” “Stay alert,” and “Look up,” judging by an app teardown last year &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/18/digital-wellbeing-heads-up-notifications-walking-distracted/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOAIB5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/FUPMuSnwqB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FUPMuSnwqB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jay Prakash Kamat (@jay__kamat) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jay__kamat/status/1381157364791832579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVMomS"&gt;“Use with caution. Heads Up doesn’t replace paying attention,” says Google despite the obviousness of such advice. Nevertheless, the feature seems necessary with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/technology/personaltech/distracted-walking-twalking.html"&gt;distracted walking becoming increasingly dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IIbT6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en-GB"&gt;Digital Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; is a service built into some Android phones to help manage your usage. It can be used to set limits on the amount of time you spend in specific apps, or set up a “Bedtime mode” to make a phone less distracting late at night, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0C3qE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports that Heads Up seems to be coming to Pixel phones first. We’ve contacted Google for more information on the rollout. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pro still coming soon but supply could be short, says Bloomberg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xqWDa"&gt;Apple’s next iPad Pro may face supply constraints at launch due to issues in production, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s suppliers are said to be having trouble with low manufacturing yields for the new Mini LED display rumored to be the key feature of the new 12.9-inch model; one manufacturer has reportedly paused production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Ae6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that iPad production had been delayed by a shortage of displays and display components, though the publication didn’t specify which models had been hit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1381456421607202820"&gt;According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, the new iPad Pro lineup is still expected to be announced later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk6vNj"&gt;It’s possible, though, that the larger model may have a later shipping date. The smaller model reportedly won’t use the Mini LED display, but other upgrades across the line are said to include a faster processor similar in power to the M1 chip in Apple’s new Macs, as well as an upgraded USB-C port and better cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ewlRu"&gt;So yesterday I watched the first episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH18cKTmwZ8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;Netflix documentary &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; about the 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and the accents alone made me homesick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBVvWb"&gt;For those who did not grow up in the land of dropped R’s: two thieves dressed as cops stole 13 works from the museum, valued at a total of $500 million. The art, which included paintings by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas, and Manet, has never been found and no arrests have ever been made. The museum is &lt;a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft"&gt;offering a $10 million reward&lt;/a&gt; for information leading to the recovery of the stolen works. I’m trying to avoid spoilers because even though I grew up in Boston and I’m familiar with the story, a few headlines about the doc have teased that it “solves” the case. Very interested to see the filmmakers’ theory of what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3H7md"&gt;The trailer roundup for this week has villains, shut-ins, and Ghostbusters. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdCn9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZIaqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_0GJg_Jnlo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ngEfhO"&gt;The Woman in The Window &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjiK81"&gt;Getting strong &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m01YktiEZCw&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear Window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vibes from the second trailer for this movie, which was supposed to premiere in theaters last May. Amy Adams stars as Anna Fox, a severely agoraphobic woman who suspects she witnessed the murder of her friend (played by Julianne Moore) in the neighboring building. Some serious gaslighting ensues. &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; also stars Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie, Tracy Letts, and Gary Oldman. It hits Netflix May 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bx9sVK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpZrVxvG3mk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wHepYG"&gt;Cruella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kaz0F7"&gt;This is the second trailer for the upcoming origin story of the villainess from &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;and it makes me think we’re supposed to be rooting for Cruella? Even though in the original movie she wanted to make a coat out of puppies? And is literally named “cruel devil”? I’m still not totally sold on the whole notion of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899422/joker-movie-review-todd-phillips-joaquin-phoenix-incel-violence-dc-comics-batman"&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt; for a movie villain (and more are coming), but if Emmas Stone and Thompson are involved (Thompson’s character is the Baroness von Hellman... literally has “hell” right in her name) then it’s worth a look. &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters and on Disney Plus (for an additional fee)  on May 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RE5o13"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9eh37VDAG0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jzUgiB"&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5uBqRG"&gt;OK so this is a character-specific teaser trailer for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZFCF--uRY&amp;amp;t=2s&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequel with Paul Rudd, introducing us to some cute? Scary? Menacing? Stay-Puft marshmallow... creatures. Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, Carrie Coon, and some of the original Ghostbusters will be in &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which is slated for release in theaters November 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z08ffA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW948Va-l10?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF3Tp0"&gt;Loki &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JAdHYl"&gt;The next spinoff series from Marvel is all about Loki, the trickster god of Asgard, and introduces the Time Variance Authority and Owen Wilson as Mobius. Tom Hiddleston is so good as Loki that perhaps I should retract or at least rethink my earlier statement about movie villains. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; comes to Disney Plus on June 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlr6nZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0gdgE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uKyQn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvdlm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
