  &lt;p id="A0VKDI"&gt;Google’s Project Jacquard touch-sensitive fabric technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8682957/touch-sensitive-fabric-and-tiny-radar-chips-hands-on-with-ataps"&gt;first revealed&lt;/a&gt; at Google I/O in 2015, now has a way for interested third-party developers to integrate the tech with their own software via the new &lt;a href="https://atap.google.com/jacquard/jacquardsdk/"&gt;Jacquard SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMFUjP"&gt;Previously only a handful of companies signed up for Jacquard, including Levi’s, Samsonite, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20849788/google-project-jacquard-yves-saint-laurent-smart-backpack-cit-e-bluetooth-fabric-control-price"&gt;Yves Saint Laurent&lt;/a&gt;. Now developers can use the SDK to integrate the Jacquard tag, connecting its sensors with their apps to communicate touch and motion data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsonite Konnect-i" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NpdZPSxE9TqXB39e_PthgqepRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21925987/cfaulkner_200929_4215_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsonite’s Konnect-i backpack is one of very few products to integrate the touch-sensitive fibers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4V6OFK"&gt;Google’s ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects) team announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8687613/levi-google-atap-partnership-announced"&gt;first partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Levi’s in 2015, and put Jacquard technology into customers’ sleeves two years later with the 2017 release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16354712/google-project-jacquard-levis-commuter-trucker-jacket-price-release-date"&gt;Levi’s commuter jacket&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU3g5x"&gt;We thought the jacket was neat but also pretty expensive with a price that started at $350. Two years after the initial 2017 drop, Jacquard got redesigned into a smaller tag and integrated into another line of Levi’s products at a lower price. The 2019 release of the Jacquard and Levi’s trucker jacket was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20888909/google-levi-project-jacquard-available-trucker-sherpa-jackets-price-design"&gt;solid update on a shaky idea&lt;/a&gt;, which has historically been a prelude to Google &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com"&gt;sunsetting things&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSFxAm"&gt;It remains to be seen how well outside developers will embrace Jacquard, and how much support they can expect from Google. The FAQ section of the &lt;a href="https://atap.google.com/jacquard/jacquardsdk/"&gt;SDK site&lt;/a&gt; only asks one question: “Can someone add new abilities to the official Jacquard app?” to which Google responds in short: “No. The current Jacquard app remains as built.” Thankfully, the release of an SDK means that Google ATAP can hand off what seems to be their burden child and give Jacquard a fighting chance to prove it can do more than just skip your music tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VESA’s new eDP 1.5 might give your next laptop slightly better battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell G5 15 SE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mu26ih0-Du8k2Uzu6KLL73EqBKY=/99x76:1818x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063696/cfaulkner_200714_4098_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbwkZe"&gt;Don’t you love standards? I do, for the most part, particularly when they’re fixing things, and the new VESA Embedded DisplayPort 1.5 (or eDP 1.5 for short) looks likely to do that in future fancy-screened laptops. It’s promising more power savings with adaptive-sync screens, OLED panels, and displays that come with their own embedded memory for the battery saving Panel Self-Refresh (PSR) feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbfZ9X"&gt;eDP is the standard for cables and ribbons that connect your high-res screen to the rest of your laptop or tablet, and technically it’s supported all those things before — but they haven’t necessarily played nicely together. For example, I had to turn off PSR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;when I reviewed the OLED-equipped Dell XPS 15 in 2019&lt;/a&gt; because the screen was constantly flickering, even though manufacturers &lt;a href="https://pcper.com/2011/09/panel-self-refresh-a-new-way-to-save-power/"&gt;have had a decade&lt;/a&gt; to figure out the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_ip8F84MUJ9zOfXOTo5CS2ISjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967236/VESA_eDP_1.5_Panel_Replay_scaled_e1635348221890.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;VESA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panel Replay can update part of an image, instead of the entire frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJOnW"&gt;You probably shouldn’t expect &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; additional battery life here: in each of these cases (adaptive sync, OLED and PSR), VESA’s generally talking about additional runtime when your screen isn’t working very hard — perhaps not even moving at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bVUJH"&gt;Adaptive sync can tell your GPU to spit out fewer frames to match a slower refresh rate of your screen, saving power. Panel Self-Refresh can tell your GPU to produce no additional frames at all since the memory in your display could just store the current screen image in its frame buffer. And with an OLED screen, which has some natural persistence (it’s why blacks can sometimes smear), you may be able to forgo some frames as well. In each case, your GPU gets to power down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wI8GLJ"&gt;Now, VESA says eDP 1.5 adds Panel Replay, a feature also coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230654/displayport-2-monitors-delay-vesa-statement"&gt;the delayed DisplayPort 2.0&lt;/a&gt; for external monitors and desktop GPUs — it allows your computer to update &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of your screen while leaving the rest untouched, and it works with adaptive sync. eDP 1.5 also formally supports lower refresh rates for OLED screens without the frame buffer, allows adaptive sync to fine-tune the framerate to avoid skipping or repeating frames during video playback, and specifically addresses flicker. There’s also a new “ability to disable the display interface during normal operation (when not using panel self-refresh) during the vertical blanking period, which provides added power savings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dudn1"&gt;Overall, “eDP 1.5 achieves power saving by enabling the GPU to briefly power down between frames, which combined with the capability to adjust the frame rate based on workload, allows for additional power saving opportunities,” writes VESA’s chairman. “ We look forward to the increased battery life this will enable across a broad spectrum of laptop PCs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncharted creative director Amy Hennig is making a Marvel game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BAFTA LA Celebrates Amy Hennig" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c00A8bL4rnQXoJXEB0gd-JjIe44=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063580/539785444.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for BAFTA LA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsAHFQ"&gt;Amy Hennig, a former creative director at Naughty Dog who currently leads Skydance New Media, will be working on a new Marvel video game. &lt;a href="https://skydance.com/news/skydance-new-media-joins-forces-with-marvel-entertainment-to-create-an-all-new-interactive-title/"&gt;Skydance describes the game&lt;/a&gt;, which is its first, as a “narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure game, featuring a completely original story and take on the Marvel Universe” but hasn’t said which superheroes will be featured in the game. The studio also hasn’t shared a release date (or even a release timeframe) and hasn’t said which platforms the game will be available on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIO9zV"&gt;Despite how little we actually know about the game, Hennig’s involvement in a story-driven Marvel project is an intriguing proposition. Hennig served as a writer and creative director for the first three &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games, so hopefully, this new Marvel game will similarly blend action and heart to make for a compelling experience. (The combination worked well in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; game released this week&lt;/a&gt;, after all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM8icE"&gt;Skydance’s new game also joins an impressive lineup of Marvel games on the horizon, which include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641590/midnight-suns-marvel-tactics-rpg-xcom-firaxis-trailer-release-date-gamescom"&gt;tactical RPG &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from XCOM developer Firaxis and Insomniac’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665533/spider-man-2-insomniac-games-peter-parker-miles-morales-venom-ps5-2023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a Marvel fan, there are some exciting games to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new wave of lo-fi games is reshaping horror</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZk_ucYrLUYRnBo3mikdqLOCEr8=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063156/If_on_a_WInter_s_Night_Four_Travelers_alt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If on a Winter’s Night Four Travelers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Indie developers are turning pixels into scares&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="I2bUwl"&gt;Something writhes in video game horror’s dark underbelly; it has been doing so for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ooOV"&gt;But lately, convulsions have grown violent and the hideous mass threatens to spill over into the mainstream where more respectable nightmares reign. The likes of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; are now adhering to the same rules governing spectacle as the latest &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; installment, terrifying you at pristine 4K resolutions. This is the ninth console generation currently shaping our entertainment landscape, after all, and there are certain expectations as regards visual fidelity. Have you seen how the sun’s rays reflect on Castle Dimitrescu’s marble floors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJa2Ct"&gt;New retro horror scoffs at such notions of verisimilitude. It will draw the curtains to keep volumetric lighting out and puke all over the exquisite tiling so you’re not distracted by its intricate patterns. A steady procession of brash alternatives to the handful of dominating franchises (as well as the mid-budget imitations) has been making its presence felt recently. These games are inspired by long-obsolete genres implementing unconventional mechanics and evoking memories from the medium’s rich past. Wildly divergent, this new generation of lo-fi horror games is united by a shared philosophy: treating earlier, era-specific styles from the crude polygons of the original PlayStation to 1-bit monochrome palettes not as intermediary failures on the path to some dubious ideal of “realism,” but embracing them as valid aesthetic springboards in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3XMRJ"&gt;And people have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21120144/world-of-horror-steam-panstasz-lovecraft-early-access-launch-preview"&gt;paying attention&lt;/a&gt;. In the last couple of years, the scene has exploded. Puppet Combo — who has been turning his favorite childhood VHS slashers into low-poly gore-fests for about a decade — has just started his own production company, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Torture%20Star%20Video"&gt;Torture Star Video&lt;/a&gt;, mobilizing his popularity to highlight the talents of other creators in the niche. Two ongoing anthology series, &lt;a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/18324/Dread_X_Collection_Year_1_Bundle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread X Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have revitalized a format oddly neglected in the medium. And themed game jams have imposed time and theme constraints on developers consistently producing some of the most imaginative work in the field, exemplified by Teebowah’s Game Boy-inspired creepy excursion in &lt;a href="https://teebowah-games.itch.io/fishing-vacation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fishing Vacation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Ben Jelter’s trailer-park enigma of &lt;a href="https://benjelter.itch.io/opossum-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opossum Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But what has prompted the sudden surge of popularity for such archaic iconography? And why the disproportionate focus of such efforts on horror?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JzvMpsagW7JGwDW7WdChDw_g76w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962894/Dread_Delusion_alt.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread Delusion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOlwNT"&gt;A partial answer to the first question is glaringly obvious. Nostalgia has emerged as a pervasive cultural force in the last decade, from synthwave YouTube playlists to &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;. Why should gaming be exempt from its influence? Under the alias -IZMA-, Adam Birch released &lt;a href="https://izma.itch.io/deadeus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Game Boy in 2019, a Lovecraftian small-town mystery in the vein of classic JRPGs. He admits nostalgia is part of what motivates him. “When I was a kid growing up, I had a Game Boy and had friends with Mega Drives and SNES. That era is seared into my brain because of [these consoles]. It stands to reason that, when people finally achieve the ability, they’d attempt to make games similar to those that made them fall in love with it all in the first place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Myy6"&gt;The generational angle is certainly consistent with the timeline of the phenomenon. Roughly a decade separates the establishment of pixel art as a viable aesthetic even for mainstream games (such as the 2011 iOS hit &lt;em&gt;Superbrothers: Sword &amp;amp; Sworcery EP&lt;/em&gt; which sold more than a million copies) from the crude polygons and grainy video currently in the ascendant. The time span neatly corresponds to the gap between the heyday of the 8-bit platforms referenced by the former and the release of Sony’s groundbreaking PS1 console that inspires the latter — or the period during which a new crop of indie developers could have come of age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LA5Ilz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s also something about the tactility of physical media which is gratifying.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2jX9A"&gt;James Wragg, creator of standout &lt;em&gt;Haunted PS1 Demo Disc&lt;/em&gt; entry &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread Delusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, corroborates, albeit with an important caveat. “A lot of it is nostalgia, sure — the PlayStation start-up music will forever stimulate a cluster of neurons in my head. [But] there’s also something about the tactility of physical media which is gratifying; just as book lovers will relish the smell of a new book, flipping through a manual before you pop a disc in a PS1 drive is a more enticing ritual than clicking a ‘download’ button.” Nostalgia may be a universal impulse, but its siren call is most effective when it responds to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/smarter-living/why-we-romanticize-the-past.html"&gt;a certain lack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qW6LY"&gt;Birch believes the lack is not so much about the paraphernalia that used to accompany a game’s packaging (even as he catered to that need by also releasing &lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt; as a physical cartridge) but of a sufficiently diverse range of stories and experiences within the blockbuster sphere. “It has almost become a cliche that there will be a bloated overworld map with 1,000 similar tasks and some watchtower to climb. This on top of a climbing price tag and an almost ‘safe’ approach to subject matter all paves the way for completely off-the-wall, cheaper indie games to go down some dark story paths and fill the void.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGMkO-ymgBSN-2ClulNWI99mbAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962898/FAITH.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ispzvr1UwH34vvGhcZD14DIB_hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962899/FAITH_alt.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVJpka"&gt;As for developers, a different sort of lack may account for new retro horror’s appeal: the ability to compete with big-budget spectacle. “Using low-poly models or creating 1-bit visuals is a much more sensible option for most indie devs who might be more interested in telling a story or inducing specific feelings than in movie-realistic graphics,” says Laura Hunt, co-creator of the decidedly unrealistic but visually stunning cosmic-horror adventure &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603980/If_On_A_Winters_Night_Four_Travelers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If On A Winter’s Night, Four Travelers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While she has worked on perennial favorite Adventure Game Studio, a wider range of accessible specialist tools are increasingly facilitating the creation of perfect simulacra of a Commodore 64 or an SNES title. Birch even acknowledges that the genre and mood of &lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt; were shaped by the limitations of GB Studio, the engine he experimented with while developing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsf7T"&gt;While arguments based on generational nostalgia apply equally to most retro-styled games, the growing availability of intuitive middleware points to an aspect of the phenomenon that is more horror-specific. Ted Hentschke, the mind behind the &lt;em&gt;Dread X Collection &lt;/em&gt;project, believes that, as with the flood of found-footage movies that followed &lt;em&gt;Paranormal Activity&lt;/em&gt;’s wide release in 2009, “the current popularity of retro-styled horror games has less to do with nostalgia than it does with the idea that any one of us can do it. When you look at Airdorf’s &lt;a href="https://airdorf.itch.io/faith"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FAITH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that little pixel guy walking around, it doesn’t seem impossible that I could do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BqzH43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They can prime the player’s mind to be surprised and creeped out.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pr6Cq"&gt;There’s a reason for that. &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt; may be one of the most famous titles in the scene, an exorcism simulator that put to rest any silly notions that pixel art can’t scare the wits out of you, but it looks as if it could run on a 1982 Atari console. Mason Smith, better known as Airdorf, has an explanation for the capacity for such unorthodox visuals to unsettle that circles back to the blockbuster-fatigue argument. “Since retro-styled graphics have this innocent lo-fi quality to them, I think they can prime the player’s mind to be surprised and creeped out when the game goes after the player themselves, more so than your advanced 3D graphics.” While the homogeneity of marquee franchises will put off a segment of the audience in any genre, it is horror that, by its very nature, thrives on the unexpected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7eFV0"&gt;This framing also serves to illuminate a deeper link between new retro horror and the cursed-media fad manifesting in the form of &lt;em&gt;Ringu&lt;/em&gt;-inspired movies, explicitly meta games (such as Ivan Zanotti’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/429720/IMSCARED/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imscared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and umpteen creepypasta threads. As &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt; oscillates between pixel-art gameplay and jarringly incongruous rotoscoped cutscenes, the latter are so much more obviously advanced that they generate an impression of the game clambering up the ontological ladder and coming alive. Airdorf concedes that “although it was never meant to be a ‘cursed’ meta-game, I still admired the long-lasting effects those had on players. There are a few details that came from the ‘cursed’ game phenomenon, like the chromatic aberration effect that glitches the screen a little bit when something spooky happens.” Paradoxically, the flexibility of retro visuals allows for a broader arsenal of scares than the mandates of realism dictating the direction of big-budget horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U3OXg"&gt;At the same time, the question arises whether, with an expanding fan base and the arrival of the PS1 as an in-vogue reference point, the scene is inching toward an impasse. The long-running appeal of pixel art has already led to it being assimilated into the mainstream and, to some degree, stripped of its power to surprise. Could that be the future for other strains of new retro horror? More fundamentally, while people will always feel a personal sense of nostalgia for the console they grew up with, the PS1 was arguably the last piece of hardware to effect deep cultural change while introducing an instantly recognizable iconography. It is not that it’s too early to adopt, say, an Xbox 360 aesthetic; it’s that the very notion of it seems inconceivable. It is not unreasonable to suspect that we are running out of distinct visual styles to reclaim from the medium’s history, but whether that spells doom for the movement as a creative endeavor remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHFTJy"&gt;Wragg offers a thoughtful rebuttal. “Like impressionism in painting, the PS1 style portrays reality through the subjective vision of an artist. With smaller budgets and less at stake, these artists are free to create worlds that are surreal, strange, or uniquely beautiful in a way that you might not see in the mainstream industry. The intentional jankiness of the scene is like when punk music incorporates noise and reverb, a postmodern acceptance of the seams and imperfections within art that becomes part of the artwork itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4GIsmA"&gt;In this light, it’s not the fondness for a particular era’s visuals that defines this haphazard movement whose instruments of revolution consist of blocky pixels, garish colors, and a whole lot of visual static. Instead, it’s the impetus to seek a language of creative expression outside accepted conventions. New retro horror is just the latest iteration of that never-ending quest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make a modern slasher movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JT5lr-wG-JXn7MsGwuybaFZ8FYA=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062845/TSIYH_20190829_01578r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s Someone Inside Your House.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: David Bukach / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InoNQm"&gt;When Stephanie Perkins sat down to write her first horror novel, &lt;em&gt;There’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Someone Inside Your House&lt;/em&gt;, she looked somewhere very specific for inspiration: slasher movies. “I loved those movies as a teenager, and they had a huge influence on me,” she says. “There actually aren’t a ton of slashers in novel form, and I learned while trying to write one that there’s a pretty good reason for that: it’s a really visual and auditory medium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFEeGa"&gt;The book tells the story of a killer in a small Nebraska town who loves a gruesome murder and centers on high school student Makani, who recently moved from Hawaii for a fresh start after a tragic incident. The book has since been turned into a slasher movie itself, which debuted this month on Netflix. &lt;em&gt;There’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Someone Inside Your House&lt;/em&gt; is part of a resurgence for the subgenre — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579993/fear-street-netflix-horror-trilogy-summer-movie"&gt;earlier this year, Netflix turned a &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; trilogy into a summer movie event&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722404/scream-smart-home-locks-phones-apps-horror"&gt;classic franchises like &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; are making a comeback — and it’s a great example of how slashers are being updated for modern audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrnYBq"&gt;First, the big question: just what is it that makes slashers in particular so enduring? The genre is best exemplified by iconic characters like Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers, who came into existence in the late ’70s and early ’80s and expanded to classics like &lt;em&gt;Candyman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Child’s Play&lt;/em&gt;. For Perkins, what makes slashers work so well, and what has made them popular for so long, is that they’re the most approachable form of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4H6Yv"&gt;“There’s this catharsis and a space to explore dark ideas,” she explains. “One of the things that I personally get out of the slasher genre is that it typically comes with a good sense of humor, and there’s often a romantic element to it as well. Even if it’s your baseline ‘teen couple having sex.’ Those elements — the humor and the romance — they tend to provide a pretty good balance and make it a good entry point for people who maybe don’t consume a lot of horror. I really feel like slashers are horror-light, and they tend to have a broader audience because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udRwV8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IdZ43OuZXjQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHvRWD"&gt;Henry Gayden, the screenwriter for the film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;There’s Someone Inside Your House&lt;/em&gt;, adds that “[t]he other component that makes them endure is the age range of the characters in them. Usually — not always — they’re teenagers. And I think that’s for a reason. The ones that really endure are usually somewhat coming of age stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oz5NNA"&gt;The trick to making a new one, he says, is finding a hook to set it apart from the many, many blood-soaked slashers from the last few decades. (As part of preparing to adapt the novel, Gayden says he watched 153 different slasher movies for research, from genre-defining titles to more obscure and forgotten fare.) In the case of &lt;em&gt;There’s Someone Inside Your House&lt;/em&gt;, there are a few things the movie tries to do differently. One is pulled directly from the source material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3o5tlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hknVve"&gt;“What really made me want to write a slasher movie was the way Stephanie wrote the book,” he says. “Most slasher movies, with the exception of the big ones — &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; — don’t really have memorable characters, don’t really care about emotional investment. What her book brought was that background into a genre that doesn’t usually have feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaK9wX"&gt;This, in turn, connected to the most fun part of the genre: the kills. Gayden was able to not only come up with inventive and gruesome ways for characters to die but also find ways for those deaths to connect to the hidden secrets that caused them to be targeted in the first place. (In an unsettling twist, the movie’s killer wears a 3D printed mask of the impending victim.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYi7Ad"&gt;“I wrote the first two set-pieces first because I wanted to figure out the tone and make them scary and funny if I could,” Gayden says of the process for coming up with kills. “I wanted to have something emotional in those two, which is why I brought this idea of not only are you killed by someone, but you’re going to be killed by someone who knows the one thing about you that you don’t want anyone else to know. And when you die, they’re going to tell the world about it. Not only that, they’re wearing your face.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGI-HFbg19TvFq4DLFP1qqG2ZCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964519/TSIYH_20190830_02063r2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: David Bukach / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s Someone Inside Your House.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XKWGrG"&gt;For the original novel, Perkins had a slightly different mandate for the deaths. “What’s the grossest way that I can do this? That’s what I was genuinely interested in,” she says. “For me, that was the most fun part. It’s like a cartoon level of violence; it’s not something we typically see in the real world. So as someone who watches lots and lots of horror, I really do get — as terrible as it might sound — really excited to see cool deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Oqept"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve always been afraid of the same things.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XaoeDN"&gt;One of the great things about horror is how the core element — the scares — often stands the test of time. The classics persist because they still have the ability to frighten, even if they’re lacking in modern special effects. The slasher movie canon is filled with movies that are almost timeless in a strange, blood-soaked way. And Perkins has a theory for why that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9hS9Y"&gt;“We’ve always been afraid of the same things,” she says. “And those are never going to go away. You’ll see things change in the genre, in terms of victimology or how we’re discussing the characters, but if you can scare someone 40 years ago, you can scare them with that same material now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota’s new electric SUV has a solar roof and a steering yoke like Tesla </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9nPj8avbV75HdD4puDDG6vd0f2k=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062765/20211029_01_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n9LvNC"&gt;Toyota released new details about its upcoming electric compact SUV, the BZ4X, which includes an optional solar roof and a steering yoke similar to the one featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;the latest version of the Tesla Model S&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALZr9h"&gt;The steering yoke, which Toyota describes as having a “wing-shape,” employs a steer-by-wire system, where there is no mechanical connection between the steering wheel and tires. The yoke only needs to turn up to 150 degrees from side to side and the driver doesn’t ever need to remove their hands. This will eliminate the need to change grips when steering, which the company argues will make U-turns and other maneuvers easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBSBh7"&gt;Toyota first revealed the BZ4X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;earlier this year at the Shanghai Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, along with an electric vehicle strategy that the company said will result in 15 new battery-electric vehicles released by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mcp6uC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The yoke only needs to turn up to 150 degrees from side to side&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXBFTd"&gt;The BZ4X will be built on a flexible platform that it developed in partnership with fellow Japanese automaker Subaru. (Toyota currently owns a small stake in Subaru.) The e-TNGA platform will enable several characteristics, including a steer-by-wire system, all-wheel drive, improved visibility, and a regenerative braking system that is common among electric vehicles. Toyota said the BZ4X would be released globally by the middle of 2022. Subaru is said to be designing its own electric vehicles built on the e-TNGA platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GneHBJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834580"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7nxeU"&gt;The BZ4X will also come with a standard steering wheel and system, for those not interested in going full yoke. (The Model S yoke has been controversial, with &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports &lt;/em&gt;saying it can make driving awkward.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OJErI"&gt;The interior of the car features a unique instrument cluster, with the screen set back from the steering wheel in a way that Toyota says will improve driver visibility. The central infotainment screen appears to be floating above the dash as opposed to embedded within it. And there are a number of physical buttons in the center console and on the steering wheel, proof that Toyota is not fully embracing the digital user experience like companies like Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4recZ"&gt;Toyota’s designers took some inspiration from the hammerhead shark when outlining the BZ4X’s exterior. That said, it still retains a conventional shape and appears to be similar in size to a Toyota RAV4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGYsx9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota’s designers took some inspiration from the hammerhead shark when outlining the BZ4X’s exterior&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XklZvB"&gt;It will come with two powertrains: a 201-horsepower front-wheel-drive, and a 215hp all-wheel-drive that will have estimated ranges of 310 and 286 miles per charge, respectively. (Those estimates are based on the global WLTC rating, which tends to be higher than the EPA’s estimates.) The vehicle is equipped with a 71.4kWh battery pack, which is on par with the Volkswagen ID 4 and the Nissan Ariya in terms of energy capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNKejk"&gt;There are other quirky options, including a solar roof that Toyota says can generate electricity “equivalent to 1,800 km of driving distance per year.” It’s also capable of bidirectional charging for vehicle-to-home capacity, much like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford F-150 Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUiMy0"&gt;The electric SUV is expected to land first in Japan in mid-2022, though Toyota hasn’t said whether it would be available in the US. More details about pricing and production are expected in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgoBQq"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Toyota’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup. Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, it reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9Fdq2cbCOno63VPkrLW_l1q9i4=/0x114:3722x2595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062458/51637033819_8899737def_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(From L to R) ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, along with NASA astronauts Tom Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron during a dress rehearsal ahead of flight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BFPCCc"&gt;SpaceX is launching another crew to space this weekend, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-month-long stay in orbit. Traveling inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, the crew will get an early start on their mission, with liftoff scheduled for 2:21AM ET on October 31st out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5T1RE"&gt;The mission is called Crew-3, and it will carry NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. This will be the first trip to space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari — the mission’s commander. For Marshburn, this will be his third flight to space, and for each of his missions, he’s flown on a different vehicle. His first flight was on the Space Shuttle and his second flight was on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. Now he’ll get to experience the Crew Dragon, which the astronauts have nicknamed “Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erkIUc"&gt;Crew-3 is SpaceX’s third operational crewed flight for NASA as part of the space agency’s Commercial Crew Program — an initiative to use private vehicles to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As part of its initial contract with NASA, SpaceX is slated to perform up to six crewed flights for the agency, with two flights tentatively scheduled for next year. However, NASA recently indicated it is already thinking of how to transport astronauts beyond those initial missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rkf4Sp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUrHY9"&gt;While this is SpaceX’s third operational mission, it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit on the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. In order to prove the Crew Dragon’s safety for NASA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. That first successful test flight paved the way for SpaceX to start doing routine flights with Crew Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmXRG8"&gt;And in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX launched a crewed flight called Inspiration4&lt;/a&gt; that carried four non-NASA astronauts to orbit. Touted as an all-civilian crew, the passengers included a tech billionaire — who paid for the trip — a childhood cancer survivor, a professor, and an engineer. The foursome, who stayed in orbit for just three days, used the launch as a way to raise charity for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. It was SpaceX’s first truly private human spaceflight mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkObwH"&gt;Though Inspiration4 wasn’t a NASA mission, SpaceX learned a few things from that flight that will help with the upcoming Crew-3 trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pih5I7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NUMBER ONE PROBLEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="POENO3"&gt;The Crew Dragon that flew the Inspiration4 flight operated pretty smoothly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681339/spacex-inspiration4-crew-return-earth-splashdown"&gt;except for one key element&lt;/a&gt; inside the spacecraft: the toilet. This week, SpaceX revealed that a tube in the toilet that transports urine into a storage tank came unglued. This caused urine to spray into the toilet’s fan system instead and pool under the floor. It wasn’t really a problem during the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaRu5"&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back,” William Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of flight. “We got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor, and we saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DeEBBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFcVb6"&gt;After seeing this, SpaceX worried that the same problem might be happening on the Crew Dragon used for Crew-2, which is currently docked with the International Space Station. Sure enough, the astronauts on the space station went inside that Crew Dragon and found similar urine contamination under the floor of the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hFNFEZz19ju3KBbqe8cZrij2VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966250/51137531971_c3db77a39c_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESA / NASA / Thomas Pesquet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the toilet inside the Crew Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsOEbW"&gt;The main concern with this pooling is that it’s not just urine collecting under the floor; SpaceX adds a compound to the urine called Oxone, which removes the ammonia from the liquid to help get rid of odor and prevent bacteria from growing. But SpaceX became worried that the mixture of Oxone and urine in the floor could actually corrode the spacecraft itself. The company did tests that involved combining the urine and Oxone mixture with aluminum — the primary metal used to make Crew Dragon — inside a chamber that simulated the same temperature and humidity on board the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5I071"&gt;The toilet issue was more of a problem on Inspiration4, since the crew spent their entire mission inside Crew Dragon, using the bathroom for multiple days, leading to more potential corrosion. Most of SpaceX’s other Crew Dragon missions send people straight to the International Space Station, so astronauts are typically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only using the toilet before docking. Also SpaceX claims that the aluminum alloy it uses on Crew Dragon is “very insensitive” to corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMn9zN"&gt;SpaceX opted to fix the toilet issue anyway by making the toilet an “all-welded structure” so that there are no longer any parts or tubes that can come unglued. That way no unwanted liquids will cause any trouble again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IgarsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SIX-MONTH STAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3WYsrg"&gt;Crew-3 is set to take off from SpaceX’s launch site LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The crew will then spend a little less than a full day in orbit before rendezvousing with the International Space Station. Crew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously with the ISS, but the astronauts can jump in during the process if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="agdKd7"&gt;Once Crew-3 arrives, there will be a changing of the guard. The four Crew-2 astronauts already on board the space station will greet the incoming astronauts and get them settled. Then in mid-November, the Crew-2 members will climb into their own Crew Dragon and return back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPXkLz"&gt;As for the Crew-3 astronauts, they’ll be on board the ISS for six months, scheduled to come back sometime in the spring of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7AaTft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-3 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will take off on Sunday, October 31st, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWQqcV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 2:21AM / San Francisco: 11:21PM / London: 7:21AM / Berlin: 8:21AM / Moscow: 9:21AM / New Delhi: 11:51AM / Beijing: 2:21PM / Tokyo: 3:21PM / Melbourne: 5:21PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geralt fights giant monsters, and Jaskier befriends rats in new Witcher season 2 trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5PDuBW28YSEzQbw5Z3WdVIpmNE=/285x0:1938x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062441/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_10.02.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfZ6Hx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX6e6ZLNmtA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; has gotten its official, full-length, real trailer today, giving the best look yet at the monsters, magic, and mayhem that await Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill), Ciri (Freya Allan), and Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra) when the show arrives on Netflix on December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SST9dg"&gt;The new trailer teases a lot more about what to expect from the upcoming second season, including the upcoming war with the Nilfgaardian Empire, Ciri’s training to become a witcher, Geralt’s usual monster hunting, and the long-awaited return of everyone’s favorite bard, Jaskier (Joey Batey).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-crTYTOwhfbd2fvV4S6qiP4E8F8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966537/W_202_Unit_01821_RT20210913_4450_f7e3m6.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oeoeIt"&gt;It’s also the latest salvo in Netflix’s marketing bombardment for the show, which has so far included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;the teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;first look clips and behind-the-scene videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;brief Twitter teases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;the release date announcement&lt;/a&gt;. It’s no wonder that Netflix is going all-in on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season, though — the first season was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of its most popular series ever&lt;/a&gt; (even if it’s since been surpassed by other shows like &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwY9qh"&gt;The expanded &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe isn’t stopping with season 2, either. Netflix has already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;prequel anime film, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/25/22692068/netflix-tudum-season-3-anime-film-kids-family-series"&gt;announced a third season of the main series&lt;/a&gt;, a second anime film, and a family-friendly series set in the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India will get this $87 JioPhone Next instead of the Pixel 6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mm3IS7wIeZ_bGX__tklWV6kXoxI=/0x197:720x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062385/jiophone_next_blue_edition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new JioPhone Next is a collaboration between Google and Indian telecom Jio Platforms. | Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlzir3"&gt;Google and Indian telecom company Jio Platforms finally unveiled their budget smartphone for India on Friday, the JioPhone Next. The phone is designed as an affordable 4G device to serve “the unique needs of the Indian consumer,” Android India engineering lead Ram Papatla said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f5mRA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-india-3042428/"&gt;India won’t be getting&lt;/a&gt; Google’s new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, and those phones’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;premium prices&lt;/a&gt; put them out of reach of many smartphone consumers in the country. But Google and Jio have designed this new device as a more affordable 4G option. It’s priced at 6499 Indian rupees, or $87, and is available at Jio Mart retailers in India or &lt;a href="https://www.jio.com/jiophone-next/specifications"&gt;on Jio’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Google said users can also put a down payment of 1999 rupees and choose a payment plan through Jio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0eJsl"&gt;The JioPhone runs Pragati OS, which Google says is an optimized version of Android, and can access apps in the Play Store. The device has read-aloud and language translation for on-screen text, a camera with India-centric Snapchat Lenses, and embedded voice-first features that support 10 different languages spoken in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4GaAJ"&gt;“Among the many rich features of JioPhone Next, the one that has impressed me the most — and one that will empower common Indians the most and take their digital journeys to the next level — is its contribution to India’s linguistic integration. India’s unique strength is our linguistic diversity,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms. “Those Indians who might not be able to read content in English or in their language can get it translated, and even read out, in their own language on this smart device.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyvRem"&gt;The phone has a 5.45-inch HD plus Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display, a 60Hz refresh rate, a 13-megapixel rear camera with support for HDR, an 8-megapixel autofocus front camera, a 3,500mAh battery, a Qualcomm quad-core QM-215 chipset, with 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable storage. It’s dual-SIM capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iblSns"&gt;The JioPhone Next will be available beginning November 4th, which is the first day of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8X2Yg"&gt;Google and Jio announced their collaboration on a budget smartphone in 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google providing a $4.5 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in the telecom company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday that the JioPhone Next was “inspired by the belief that everyone in India should benefit from the opportunities the internet creates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcUDyf"&gt;India passed the US as the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/25207/countries-with-the-highest-number-of-smartphone-users/"&gt;second-largest smartphone market&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, with more than 400 million smartphone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkALRg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update October 29th 12:33PM ET: Adds details of payment plan price option for the JioPhone Next&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricket Wireless removes speed caps from several plans and offers 5G to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SPAIN-TELECOM-WMC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfQs7GcvbqyYi3yy4Rxla4kgcNQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062348/1233713968.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzij4E"&gt;Cricket Wireless suddenly has several more options if you’re looking for access to 5G on a prepaid wireless plan. That’s because starting today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fthe-cricket-connection%2Fsubscriber-milestone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will offer nationwide 5G access across all of its plans&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397001/cricket-wireless-5g-samsung-att"&gt;launched a year ago with support for only one device&lt;/a&gt; and only on its more expensive unlimited plans. Cricket Wireless also revealed it’s added 2 million customers in the last two years and is now serving some 12.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzFH24"&gt;The other big change for Cricket Wireless is removing an 8Mbps speed cap on its cheaper $30, $40, and $55 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fcell-phone-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;. How much bandwidth Cricket Wireless can reliably provide — using AT&amp;amp;T’s network — after the caps go away is something we’ll only find out as people try it out. Reading the fine print at the bottom of the announcement points us to Cricket’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fmap.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coverage map&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lists of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fgreat-big-network%2F5g-compatible-phones.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;compatible 5G devices&lt;/a&gt;. It also points out that the $55 per month plan still carries a stipulation that “Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnyUSw"&gt;Of course, the benefits customers see from 5G, no matter which wireless carriers they use, have been pretty disappointing so far. With the changes, now you can potentially get 5G access for as little as $25 per month, per line, on a plan with four phone lines. And with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to expand the reach of its mid-band 5G connections over the next couple of years&lt;/a&gt;, even if things aren’t significantly faster for you right now, that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
