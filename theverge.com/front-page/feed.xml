    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a flood of leaks, the company formerly known as Facebook is getting more secretive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6o45y1"&gt;Last month, a researcher for Meta prepared a talk for colleagues that they knew would hit close to home. The subject: how to cope as a researcher when the company you work for is constantly receiving negative press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHTXP7"&gt;The talk had been approved and taped to show at the company’s annual research summit for employees in early November. But shortly before the event, Meta’s legal and communications department determined that the risk of the contents leaking were too great. So it disappeared from the research summit’s agenda days before, along with another pre-taped talk describing efforts to combat hate speech and bullying. Both talks never saw the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3bklE"&gt;The pulling of the talks highlights how a barrage of leaks and external scrutiny has chilled the flow of information inside the company formerly known as Facebook. Many of the changes appear designed to thwart the next Frances Haugen, who worked in the Integrity organization responsible for making the social network safer before she quit earlier this year, taking thousands of internal documents with her. Those documents served as the basis for a series of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;damning stories in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of other news outlets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Some of them, such as internal research showing Instagram and Facebook can have negative effects on young people, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;led to congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; and lawsuits. And as the bad press continues, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;Meta executives have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the documents were cherry-picked to smear the company and paint an incomplete story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfjTKe"&gt;While the documents Haugen leaked haven’t yet caused Meta to make meaningful changes to its products, they’ve already left a lasting mark on how the world’s largest social network operates, particularly in its research and Integrity divisions. Ten of the 70 preapproved talks presented at the internal research summit a couple of weeks ago received a second, more stringent review to minimize leak risk. Senior leaders, including policy and communications chief Nick Clegg, have in recent months slowed the release of Integrity research internally, asking for reports to be reviewed again before they’re shared even in private groups. In some cases, researchers have been told to make clear what is defensible by data in their work and what is opinion, and that their projects will need to be cleared by more managers before work begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F2UBYv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Last month, Meta rolled out a new “Integrity Umbrella” system designed to thwart leakers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vjMDGf"&gt;Last month, Meta rolled out a new “Integrity Umbrella” system designed to thwart leakers. The Umbrella maintains a list of employees in Integrity and gives them automatic access to join private Integrity groups in Workplace, the internal version of Facebook used by employees. When it was introduced, several employees internally pointed out that the system wouldn’t have stopped Haugen, since she worked in the Integrity division when she gathered the leaked documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exl3Ts"&gt;It’s not just the Integrity division that is locking down access to Workplace groups. The change has become so widespread that it recently prompted the creation of a dedicated group in Workplace titled “Examples of Meta Culture trending towards ‘Closed,’” where employees across the company post screenshots of previously open groups they belong to being set to private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJQxKt"&gt;This story is based on conversations with current and former Meta employees and internal Workplace posts from the past month obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; In response to this story, Meta confirmed that the company was making changes to internal communication. “Since earlier this year, we have been talking about the right model of information sharing for the company, balancing openness with sharing relevant information and maintaining focus,” said Mavis Jones, a Meta spokesperson. “This is a work in progress and we are committed to an open culture for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EcUgpa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1E8SOz"&gt;One of the core company values shared with new employees who join Meta is “Be Open.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIwF9l"&gt;“Informed people make better decisions and make a greater impact — so we work hard to ensure that everyone at Facebook can access as much information about the company as possible,” its &lt;a href="https://www.facebookcareers.com/facebook-life/"&gt;recruiting website&lt;/a&gt; reads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpjnRW"&gt;The philosophy comes directly from Mark Zuckerberg, who, until around 2016, would regularly share sensitive information with all employees during a weekly town hall — the contents of which would rarely, if ever, leak. Facebook — now Meta — has been unusually open internally, especially by Silicon Valley standards where companies like Apple preach a culture of secrecy. One former employee with a long history of working in tech marveled to me when he joined Meta’s consumer hardware group and saw detailed product roadmaps for unannounced products in which he wasn’t involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htrdWu"&gt;You barely have to read the news nowadays to know that Meta has become perhaps the leakiest and most scrutinized company in the world. Many of the leaks stem from the historically free-flowing access employees have to Workplace, which behaves like a more sanitized version of the real Facebook with a similar penchant for making things go viral. At the same time, the company’s headcount has continued to grow steadily: over 68,000 people now work at Meta full-time, up from 17,000 people at the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Phvirh"&gt;It’s within that context that Andrew Bosworth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22752986/meta-facebook-andrew-bosworth-interview-metaverse-vr-ar"&gt;one of Meta’s most powerful executives&lt;/a&gt;, wrote to employees one morning in late October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMRskF"&gt;“‘Be Open’ is one of our company values and I like to think that in my 15 years here I have lived up to that, if not even helped shape it somewhat,” he wrote in an internal post that was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps it’s no surprise then that I am getting a lot of questions about my feelings as we reconsider how we manage information internally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUzUJj"&gt;A close confidant of Zuckerberg, Bosworth is seen by many as a cultural torchbearer inside of Meta. A &lt;a href="https://boz.com"&gt;prolific&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes controversial writer, he has personally &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data#.upw3jdyR8"&gt;been the subject of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo.html"&gt;numerous leaked memos&lt;/a&gt; over the years. And with his recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;promotion to chief technology officer&lt;/a&gt;, he is now over the division that makes Workplace and sells it to other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pXo7LO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFykc"&gt;“I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we also have lost some of the good faith that once bound us as well,” Bosworth wrote in the post titled “Information and Effort.” “But even without the consideration, serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was. Not only because the cost has gone up but because the value has gone down as the odds of stumbling on useful information diminish.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH86KA"&gt;For many, Bosworth’s comments crystalized the reasoning behind the tightening of access to Workplace groups across the company: the employee base has grown too large to make the openness worth it. And even though Bosworth said in the comments that it wasn’t a response to a specific leak, it was clear the last few months of scandals had accelerated the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIPTZJ"&gt;In Integrity, the new Umbrella tool created last month tries to strike a balance. It’s essentially a master list of employees in the Integrity organization, which now numbers just over 6,000, and people from related departments based on the company’s org structure, according to documents seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re on the list, you are automatically approved to join a private Integrity group in Workplace for something like, say, combating fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JLB3I"&gt;“The Umbrella encourages open collaboration while maintaining access to closed groups to individuals who work on Integrity issues as part of their day to day work,” one of the documents read. Others who need access to an Integrity group for a specific reason can request it through a specific form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FwC0IN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it’s totally prudent and I think it will have a negative consequence for decision making”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHyeW1"&gt;Matt Perault, a former policy director for Facebook for almost nine years and current professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, thinks that the policy is long overdue. But he also said there could be negative side effects, since fewer people will have access to information that could make them better at their jobs. “I think it’s totally prudent and I think it will have a negative consequence for decision making,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvAFcc"&gt;Employees in Meta’s Integrity org agree. I looked through dozens of comments on a Workplace post from last month announcing the shift to closed groups in Integrity — news that was earlier reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/technology/facebook-workplace-transparency-leaks.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The overwhelming majority of commenters disapproved of the move to make Integrity groups private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yt2OYh"&gt;“This is [an] extremely worrisome decision,” wrote one senior engineer in the comments. “As someone who has worked both inside and outside of Integrity, I commonly see the lack of understanding of the Integrity space and challenges by the rest of the company. It hinders our efforts of building safe products with integrity by design. Sandboxing and isolating integrity discussions will further widen that empathy gap and could ultimately harm our users in the long run.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmHrBv"&gt;Others in the comments worried that walling off Integrity discussions on Workplace will marginalize the work and make it harder to collaborate with colleagues in other departments. Several made the point that the change could have the opposite of its intended effect by encouraging more leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDCCXI"&gt;“This could have a serious impact on employee satisfaction,” another engineer added, “and possibly lead to more leaks from disillusioned employees who have an incomplete view of FB’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcYQdN"&gt;You can read Bosworth’s full internal post from Oct 20th below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VWYCLz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVT0AN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.”&lt;/em&gt; - Stuart Brand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUM6hS"&gt;I have written more than a few essays on the importance of open and effective communication. “Be Open” is one of our company values and I like to think that in my 15 years here I have lived up to that, if not even helped shape it somewhat. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that I am getting a lot of questions about my feelings as we reconsider how we manage information internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmCZG3"&gt;A few years ago I wrote (in response to leaks) that those of us who communicate internally need to take care not to write less but rather to write more. As our audience grows and the threat of context collapse looms we must take care to write with complete context. The extra effort required is a natural impediment to the frequency and candor of communication but one I continue to encourage people to work through. I still believe this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCTH41"&gt;But communication is a two way street and today I want to talk about the other side of the coin. While most of my writing has gone into the art and importance of communicating, that is only half the story. There is also an art to gathering information. Each of us brings our own context (or lack thereof) to everything we stumble across and as the company grows we naturally have less of a shared understanding. We often may not even have sufficient context to ask the right question. And our misunderstanding can easily compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3KWVF"&gt;I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we also have lost some of the good faith that once bound us as well. But even without the consideration, serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was. Not only because the cost has gone up but because the value has gone down as the odds of stumbling on useful information diminish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bam7Zr"&gt;If my previous advice in response to leaks is to be more intentional when writing, my current advice is that we must insist people be more intentional when reading. But reading and writing require asymmetric effort and so to accomplish that goal I believe we must manage our information more carefully. I would be disappointed if well-meaning people could not get access to information which had a legitimate chance of improving their work, but I don’t consider requesting access to such information to be too high a bar any more than I consider asking people to write more clearly to be too high a bar. These are the natural consequences of our scale and importance and to deny them would be to stick our head in the sand in an act of wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EN3uBT"&gt;If Nothing at Facebook is Someone Else’s Problem then the problem of widespread context collapse belongs to all of us. I believe a culture can Be Open without access to information being entirely unfettered. We already have plenty of proof of that internally as there have always been areas where information was not shared broadly (matters of employment, of personnel, of acquisitions, etc…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLp44V"&gt;Closed groups simply don’t need as much context to be added to each post because people in these groups already share more. It is precisely to avoid the overlap between people without sufficient context and content without sufficient context. I think focusing our information ecosystems even has a chance of returning to us some of that serendipitous information discovery we once had. The chance that a random post from another group is useful to me is low and its presence crowds out some content that is closer to home and might actually make a difference to my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlC4lL"&gt;Those that want or need more information should be able to get it, provided it isn’t a category akin to the ones listed above. It will just take more effort. And in exchange I hope our internal dialogues are filled with more context and some of the burden of being pitch perfect can be shifted off of our authors. Because the alternative to this is that everything is open but nobody is talking. And that would be much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Cowboy Bebop: everything you need to know about Netflix’s live-action adaptation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stay up to date&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="z8NyQU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most influential anime of all time, and now it’s a live-action series on Netflix as well. The new show — which stars John Cho, Mustafa Shakir, and Daniella Pineda — is based on Shinichiro Watanabe’s classic series and even features the return of composer Yoko Kanno. The translation to live action hasn’t been without its controversy, but if you want to keep up with the latest developments — reviews, trailers, and more — this is the place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surprise: Amazon has four new smart switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jgjtTeorUjPE0pQoOdSoxwAG1R8=/0x213:1500x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145615/713t73yvUpL._AC_SL1500_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Basics new smart switches add simple smart control to existing lighting.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJP0eE"&gt;A new line of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X911T8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Basics Smart Switches&lt;/a&gt; has landed on &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the Amazon-branded smart home gadgets count up to seven, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt; and smart &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Smart-Quality-Monitor/dp/B08W8KS8D3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;indoor air quality monitor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a big leap from the one, lonely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882918/amazon-smart-plug-price-release-date-alexa-voice-control-routines-lights-ac"&gt;Amazon smart plug&lt;/a&gt; the company had left after discontinuing its indoor smart security camera last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCUPoX"&gt;Spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danwroc/status/1460277219503353864"&gt;Dan Wroclawski of Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;, the four smart switches launched on November 11th and include a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X911T8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single-pole switch ($17.99)&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5H16X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single-pole dimmer ($19.99)&lt;/a&gt; both for controlling one lighting circuit, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Switch-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X8YD3Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-way switch ($18.99) &lt;/a&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Dimmer-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5HTLS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-way dimmer ($20.99)&lt;/a&gt;, which can control one circuit from two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQofml"&gt;A smart switch turns existing hardwired lighting into smart lighting, adding app and voice control. It’s a good alternative to smart bulbs when you want to automate lighting in a room with lots of lightbulbs or decorative fixtures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwkK0sC4-vHi6f7fKYOtjCL6M8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016479/71pPnO0kwHL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Basics 3-Way Smart Dimmer Switch needs a neutral wire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WWfFfg"&gt;One advantage of Amazon’s own smart home devices is that they work with Amazon’s Frustration Free Setup and Certified for Humans programs, which means they should be simple to set up, especially if you already have an Echo smart speaker in your home. The downside is that these switches will not work with any other smart home system or voice assistant; they are only Alexa-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuArjs"&gt;You also have to install them. These smart switches need to be hardwired into your home’s wiring and require a neutral wire. If you have an older home with no neutral, then &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-Wallplate-Assistant-Incandescent-PDW-6WCL-WH/dp/B07SJJBTYY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lutron Caseta&lt;/a&gt; or GE Lighting &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GE-3-Wire-Smart-Switch-Motion-Sensing/dp/B082LK4X4X/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=ge+cync+no+neutral+wire+switch&amp;amp;qid=1636995782&amp;amp;sr=8-3-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFSlk4MDBGTVdVRDImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxODI0MzgzQ1BHSkhBWVRIN1I2JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNzgwNDkxRjg3MEVTUlFZNVFMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cync’&lt;/a&gt;s neutral-wire free options will be a better fit. But if you have the right wiring, these are a good value for a smart switch, prices for which generally range from around $25 to upwards of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klEIDj"&gt;The new Amazon switches do not require a smart home hub to connect to the internet for automation and will work with Alexa for voice and app control. Once installed, they can be used as a traditional light switch, with the added smarts that come from being able to ask the voice assistant to turn them on and off with an Echo speaker, add them into Alexa Routines in the Alexa app, and create schedules for them. The two switches with dimming capability can also adjust the brightness with voice or app control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PABHh4_s1t0no5MmOX1bOeNq6nM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016521/61Kt4yA1e5L._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The single-pole smart switch costs $17.99 and adds smart control with Alexa to a single lighting circuit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgDEOq"&gt;As is the theme with Amazon Basics devices, these are simply designed. The single-pole switches look just like a regular paddle switch and have a small status light LED at the bottom. The dimmer options have a plus or minus button above the paddle to adjust the brightness and a row of green LEDs up top for a visual indicator of brightness level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2j1EJy"&gt;It’s surprising, however, to see Amazon stating on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5H16X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt; that these smart switches are for exclusive use with Alexa and will not support other voice assistants or smart hubs, especially considering the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;recently reaffirmed its support of Matter&lt;/a&gt;, the open smart home standard coming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izOHni"&gt;I asked Amazon this question and Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told me: “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed so we designed the product to work over WiFi without the need for a hub to make it accessible to the broadest number of customers.” When the Matter SDK is released and Amazon has a clearer idea of the range technical details, DeCenzo said it will have more to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd4mua"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 16th, 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added a response from Amazon regarding compatibility with the new Matter standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PztXdK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Wheel of Time tries a little too hard to be Game of Thrones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m25LLGaLGMAYabGC7BeloG32fBg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149903/WOFT_S1_UT_102_191105_THIJAN_00081_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fyMrHa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; is Amazon’s second-biggest TV bet ever. “I want my &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;,” CEO Jeff Bezos is &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/inside-amazons-wheel-of-time"&gt;reported to have said&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;, along with Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-cost-465-million-one-season-4167791/"&gt;eye-wateringly expensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;show coming in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;September 2022&lt;/a&gt;, are the results. It’s a big adaptation of even bigger fantasy novels, an attempt to beat HBO’s blockbuster hit at its own game and give Amazon a prestige genre series of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7sMyh"&gt;But for all the money and effort that’s gone into the show, Amazon hasn’t made a &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;successor, try as it might. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting attempt at adapting Robert Jordan’s behemoth of a book series, but it’s also dragged down both by its unwieldy source material and its efforts to twist itself into a second coming of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY8mmG"&gt;To understand the difficulty of what Amazon and showrunner Rafe Judkins are attempting, you need to understand the sheer scale of the source material, which spans 14 novels and a prequel. The original books weigh in at over 10,000 pages (over twice as long as the completed A Song of Ice and Fire books) and were published over a span of 30 years by two authors (with Brandon Sanderson stepping in to finish the saga after Jordan’s death in 2007). There are no fewer than 2,782 named characters mentioned over the course of the series, 148 of which are &lt;a href="https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Point_of_View_Characters"&gt;point of view characters&lt;/a&gt; at one point or another. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="owV7PO"&gt;What distinguishes the initially generic &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; from other &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-inspired fantasies is its setting. Thousands of years before the show begins, magic was corrupted, tainting the source of power such that any man who tried to use it would go mad. Women, on the other hand, were still spared that disaster, leading to a group of powerful magic-wielders known as the Aes Sedai, who hold considerable sway — both sorcerous and politically. The world of the Wheel of Time is a cyclical one, though, where people are reborn in each age. That includes the Dragon, the person who caused magic to be tainted in the first place and who is destined to either destroy the world again or save it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2JAO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does its best to ease viewers into all that, paring down some of the more esoteric names and concepts and spreading out the minute details of how the world and its magic works over time. Amazon is also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheWheelOfTime/status/1459223681687699458"&gt;promising animated shorts&lt;/a&gt; that will be available alongside the show to help explain some of the backstory and lore (although those weren’t made available ahead of the premiere). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YUw2B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does its best to ease viewers in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0t0XP"&gt;The show starts off leaning heavily on cookie-cutter fantasy tropes, though. One of the Aes Sedai, Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), is searching to try and find the prophesied Dragon Reborn to usher them onto their path of destiny. She, along with her Warder (a warrior ally who travels with and protects an Aes Sedai), Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney), follows the trail to the Two Rivers, a town far in the mountains and recruits five young individuals who might fulfill the prophecy. There’s Rand (Josha Stradowski), a shepherd boy; Perrin (Marcus Rutherford), a blacksmith; Mat (Barney Harris), a gambling thief; Egwene (Madeleine Madden), the innkeeper’s daughter; and Nynaeve (Zoë Robins), the village’s healer — any of whom could be the Dragon Reborn. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; mention that there were a lot of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sm6sS"&gt;Judkins does make some key changes to update the series. The cast is aged up and far more diverse than Jordan’s iteration of his protagonists. Egwene and Nynaeve are given bigger roles, in particular, whereas Rand, Perrin, and Mat tend to take up most of the spotlight in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQxf00mQ45KkncO9NSSZor2ryYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018833/WOFT_S1_UT_102_191029_THIJAN_00637_v1__1.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3hivRN"&gt;Other changes are less thoughtful. One male character, for example, is paired up with a spouse that’s created from whole cloth for the series &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of fridging her in the first episode so that he can have something to be sad about over the course of the season. And the first season over-commits to making the central mystery of the series the basic question of which of the five main characters is going to be the prophesied Dragon Reborn, capable of wielding massive power and challenging the Dark One. It feels like an odd choice, given that it’s a fairly easy-to-guess answer, unless the show plans to diverge in far greater ways than it has in the six episodes that I got to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqdKP5"&gt;The series also focuses more on Rosamund Pike’s Moiraine as the protagonist for the show, fleshing out her role in the story and her screen time. That’s not a bad thing, given that Pike is both one of the most recognizable members of the cast and one of the best parts of the show. But it does stand out, much in the same way as making Dumbledore the main character in the first &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2hPAY"&gt;The show does generally look good, with sweeping shots of the lovely Czech landscapes, impressive costumes, and expensive-looking sets. The depiction of the primary form of magic (“channeling”), where characters are meant to be drawing in power from the world around them and weaving it into blasts of fire or bursts of air, is more hit or miss. Some scenes manage to portray it as powerful and compelling magic, while others consist of characters just standing around while white wisps of smoke fly around them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Z8DjqqOPyLeGBkR0Mw-7NnSn-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018834/WOFT_S1_FG_101_435109_Still090.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s hit or miss channeling in action&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TaoEBa"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; influence is problematically strong, though, with extra sex, blood, and gore added in. It’s enough to be jarring, although nothing here quite reaches the often-gratuitous levels of its HBO predecessor. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;is also a much grimmer show than its source material, having excised nearly all the levity and humor in an effort to be more mature, to its detriment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6aiZt"&gt;And that’s a big part of &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s problem. It spends too much time trying to be Game of Thrones, even as it tells a very different kind of story. &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; reveled in its darker world, characters, and the machinations to try and seize power. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, doesn’t have the games, and it doesn’t have the throne. There are few, if any, grey areas; the big bad of the world is literally “The Dark One,” served by his army of bestial, unthinking Trollocs (think orcs, crossed variously with wolves, bears, and boars) who literally eat people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mBpU0T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Wheel of Time might actually succeed — if it stops trying so hard to be another Game of Thrones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2UAtg9"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does fire on all cylinders, it’s proof that it might actually be possible to fit the book into a coherent TV show. And Amazon is definitely confident that it’ll be able to find some success; the company has already renewed the show for a second season, out of a planned eight that &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/the-wheel-of-time-mat-cauthon-role-donal-finn-rafe-jenkins-plans-amazon-series-1234870995/"&gt;Judkins has envisioned&lt;/a&gt;. A story this big definitely needs some time to get going — and at the very least, Amazon seems to be giving &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W98lbp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first three episodes of the Wheel of Time debut on Amazon Prime Video on November 19th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Avatar is being shot on a Mandalorian-style virtual stage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwvZLX66dRBBNhgNdENbiMrRmbo=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149893/Avatar_Group_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HFEpSc"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; has kicked off production in Vancouver, and the show will be utilizing some notable tech to create its fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSFsg0"&gt;Netflix says it has partnered with effects studio Pixomondo on a custom-built facility that’s 84 feet across, 28 feet high, and features 23,000 square feet of stage and more than 3,000 LED panels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;It’s similar to the virtual sets utilized most famously by Disney on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to Netflix, the set “allows for visual effects to be done in real time in camera, combining multiple environments on a single stage.” The company calls it “one of the biggest virtual production volumes in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga4b9t"&gt;The upcoming adaptation has not been without controversy; last year &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365329/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-michael-dante-dimartino-bryan-konietzko-departure"&gt;left the project citing creative differences&lt;/a&gt;. Albert Kim has since taken over as showrunner. This summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621540/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-cast"&gt;Netflix revealed the initial cast for the show&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company has revealed three new roles: Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (&lt;em&gt;Kim’s Convenience) as&lt;/em&gt; Uncle Iroh, Ken Leung&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Lost&lt;/em&gt;) as Commander Zhao, and Lim Kay Siu&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Anna and The King&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Nightwatch&lt;/em&gt;) as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Gyatso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnpwpQ"&gt;There’s no word yet on when Avatar is expected to hit Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Photos gets overhauled, at least on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjNxCn4kIqqfCH3iwz3mv-jOhdM=/112x0:1288x784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149805/amazon_photos_overhaul_ios.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIe8uO"&gt;Amazon Photos on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-photos-cloud-drive/id621574163"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; just got a major redesign, as outlined in a post on the &lt;a href="https://amazonphotos.blog/introducing-the-redesigned-amazon-photos-app-for-ios-6dba18d0fb2b"&gt;Amazon Photos blog&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Amazon might be trying to level the playing field with Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qO8ROb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yGdL6no4E4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MrH26"&gt;The update aims to bring smoother navigation, essentially placing all options within “a thumb’s reach.” From the home screen, you should be able to singlehandedly access your photos and account information. The home screen also features a customized slideshow that displays a reel of memories, highlighting vacations, photos of the current date from previous years, and a random selection of photos that change on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDKejz"&gt;Once you select a gallery, Amazon notes that you’ll no longer have to keep scrolling to find a specific picture — swiping up on the screen reveals a control panel that lets you filter through photos by people, place, and year. There’s no word on when (or if) Amazon will update the Photos app on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kVBJl"&gt;Despite Amazon offering free unlimited photo storage for Prime users, the service has lagged considerably behind Google Photos, so much so that some Echo users &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-show-10-would-be-best-smart-screen-ever-if-it-just-added-one-feature"&gt;prefer using Google Photos&lt;/a&gt; on their devices — something that Amazon has yet to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2XcLf"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;October interview with David Limp&lt;/a&gt;, the senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Limp about integrating Google Photos with Echo devices. His response suggests that Amazon would welcome the integration, but the decision would depend on Google: “Amazon Photos is in my organization, but I’d also love to entertain a deal with Google with their photos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tb1Yfg"&gt;It looks like Amazon is starting to focus more of its resources on its Photos service, though, as demonstrated by the age of the &lt;a href="https://amazonphotos.medium.com/"&gt;Amazon Photos blog&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon published its first post in August of this year and seems to be continually providing updates about Photos. While the establishment of a new blog doesn’t really mean much, it seems that Amazon is ready to remind people it has a Photos service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ohio suing Facebook, says it misled the public about the effect its products have on children</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChuX_3q-btk-mm_eCWtB_gbXbhc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149649/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ohio is suing Facebook | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SEu2CI"&gt;Ohio is suing Facebook’s parent company, Meta, claiming the social media platform misled the public about the effects its products have on children. The lawsuit, filed November 12th on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), is seeking more than $100 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JYMEN"&gt;The suit alleges that between April 29th and October 21st, Facebook and top executives violated federal securities law when they intentionally misled the public and deceived shareholders about how its products can negatively affect children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R6VNZ"&gt;“Facebook said it was looking out for our children and weeding out online trolls, but in reality was creating misery and divisiveness for profit,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost &lt;a href="https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2021/Attorney-General-Yost-Sues-Facebook-for-Securities"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday. He added that when the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began publishing a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=article_inline"&gt;series of articles&lt;/a&gt; based on internal documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, “the truth began to emerge.” According to the documents, Facebook’s own internal research showed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;Instagram photo-sharing platform might be harmful&lt;/a&gt; to the mental health of teenagers, especially girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmPhUg"&gt;After the reports were published, Facebook’s stock dropped, causing the retirement system and other investors in the company to lose more than $100 billion, Yost said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hJq3"&gt;According to the lawsuit, OPERS manages assets worth approximately $125 billion on behalf of 1.1 million active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. The system “purchased shares of Facebook Class A common stock at artificially inflated prices” in 2021 and “suffered damages as a result of the violations of the federal securities laws alleged.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BT5W13"&gt;Meta spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the suit is “without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0GG0U"&gt;In addition to recovering the lost $100 billion, Yost said, the lawsuit “demands that Facebook make significant reforms to ensure it does not mislead the public about its internal practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
