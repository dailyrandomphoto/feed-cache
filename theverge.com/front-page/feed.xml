    <title>Tesla starts using in-car camera for Autopilot driver monitoring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AP6vhO8otzX9VpYDVatUiaKtGQ=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353677/d3d70c40_031e_480a_85d6_4bff05670ea3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBw4zB"&gt;Tesla is starting to use the camera above the rear-view mirror in the Model 3 and Model Y to help make sure people pay attention to the road while using Autopilot, the company’s advanced driver assistance system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Kayb"&gt;Until now, the main way Tesla’s cars measure driver attention is through torque sensors in the steering wheel that look for resistance — a crude way of ensuring drivers keep their hands on the wheel. If it doesn’t register enough feedback, the car performs a series of escalating visual and audible warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owJ7hd"&gt;The change comes after regulators and safety experts spent years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;begging&lt;/a&gt; Tesla to add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;better driver monitoring to its cars&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even admitted that crashes involving Autopilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt;stem from complacency&lt;/a&gt;. But he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17352814/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-face-tracking-gm"&gt;previously rejected his own engineers’ calls&lt;/a&gt; to add more robust driver monitoring to the company’s cars. Musk said at the time that the tech was “ineffective.” Companies like General Motors and Ford currently sell cars with camera-based eye-tracking systems that are meant to make sure drivers pay attention while using hands-free driving features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCWazs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla ignored safety board’s Autopilot recommendations, chairman says","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"},{"title":"Tesla Autopilot, distracted driving to blame in deadly 2018 crash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fsF3qS"&gt;A Twitter user who says they just took delivery of a new Model Y &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spleck/status/1398015162255298560"&gt;posted an image Thursday that shows software release notes&lt;/a&gt; describing the new safety feature: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0udB3j"&gt;The cabin camera above your rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged. Camera data does not leave the car itself, which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65s2we"&gt;In subsequent tweets, the Model Y owner said the steering wheel sensor alerts were still active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaNfI7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; has also &lt;a href="https://t.co/82d3tZACu3"&gt;seen the release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWkClX"&gt;Model S and Model X vehicles made before 2021 do not have a cabin camera, though the redesigned versions announced in January (which have still not shipped) are supposed to have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h1DSKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It will watch for “driver inattentiveness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKCpKF"&gt;Tesla doesn’t define the term “driver inattentiveness” that it uses in the release notes, or what happens if it decides someone isn’t paying sufficient attention. Earlier this year, hacker @greentheonly and an accomplice were able to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWR4MQBI4M"&gt;tease out &lt;/a&gt;what a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTCbBsMJ3ts"&gt;work-in-progress version&lt;/a&gt; of the camera-based driver monitoring system could see. It was particularly good at noticing when the driver looked down at a phone, though it struggled in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB0Ydo"&gt;The in-car camera was pretty much benign in the early going with the Model 3 and Model Y, though Tesla started using it to make sure that drivers in the beta test of its “Full Self-Driving” version of Autopilot were paying attention to the road. Musk said in March that Tesla removed some beta testers from the program because they “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1370522745709158407"&gt;did not pay sufficient attention&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZS71o"&gt;The addition of camera-based driver monitoring feature also follows a fresh wave of scrutiny on Autopilot, which rose up after a pair of fatal crashes where it initially appeared the driver assistance system may have been involved — though, in one case, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-business-technology-204e5600ec902d0bfda10feca74a9ed0"&gt;officials walked back the claim that Autopilot was active&lt;/a&gt;, and in the other, an early report from the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429198/tesla-ntsb-texas-crash-driverless-preliminary-report"&gt;made it seem unlikely that the system was in use&lt;/a&gt;. There have also been a number of recently documented cases of social media users posting videos that show them fooling Autopilot into thinking someone is still in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cQjx2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oscar Isaac will star in Disney Plus’ Moon Knight series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRg4pa"&gt;Marvel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1397987590075129861?s=20"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that Oscar Isaac will star in the Disney Plus &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; series, bringing the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; star to another highly lucrative side of the Disney empire. Moon Knight is one of several Marvel characters who seem to be inspired by DC Comics’ Batman, and is certainly more of an obscure character to adapt, but as the company pivots into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;the next phase of movies and now shows&lt;/a&gt;, weirdness is on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfPPuP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/moon-knight-marc-spector/in-comics"&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, or Marc Spector, is a mercenary possessed by an ancient Egyptian moon god named Khonshu. That possession is what gives him his superpowers but also multiple conflicting personalities, including a taxi driver, wealthy playboy, and masked vigilante. Marvel and Isaac’s announcement — “WE ARE MOONKNIGHT” — seems to directly reference the character’s complex psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="blik1u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

The show’s head writer is Jeremy Slater, who co-created the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18214426/netflix-umbrella-academy-review-tv-series-gerard-way-my-chemical-romance-x-men-ellen-page"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Netflix show and also created and executive produced the extremely underrated &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/em&gt; TV adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilk9zl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have an announced release date, but there are several other Marvel shows on their way soon to Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is set to premiere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;on June 9th&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;are still planned for the back half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is now embroiled in a full class-action lawsuit over whether it underpaid women</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/voSFbGnH10BPJWznDWyPFTmex2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353511/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u2bdxV"&gt;Four women who used to work for Google have won class-action status for their gender equity lawsuit against the search engine company, allowing them to represent some 10,800 women, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/google-women-suing-over-gender-bias-win-class-action-status?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMo7tp"&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Google pays men more than women for the same work, in violation of California’s Equal Pay Act, and that Google paid its female employees nearly $17,000 less per year than male counterparts in the same roles. The women&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16308740/google-class-action-sexism-gender-pay-lawsuit"&gt; filed the suit in 2017,&lt;/a&gt; claiming they were put into lower career tracks than their male colleagues— so-called “job ladders” that resulted in them receiving lower bonuses and salaries. The women have since left Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHmJMc"&gt;“This is a significant day for women at Google and in the technology sector, and we are so proud of our brave clients for leading the way,” Kelly Dermody, an attorney representing the women, wrote in an email to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “This order shows that it is critical that companies prioritize paying women equitably over spending money fighting them in litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qzp1r"&gt;The plaintiffs weren’t the only ones accusing Google of systematically underpaying female employees in 2017; the US Department of Labor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14170226/google-anti-discrimination-audit-lawsuit-department-of-labor"&gt;also sued Google that year&lt;/a&gt; for withholding compensation data, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/8/15229688/department-of-labor-google-gender-pay-gap"&gt;concluded three months later&lt;/a&gt; that Google was responsible for “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261263/google-pays-3-million-us-department-labor-settlemt-allegations-pay-discrimination"&gt;Google agreed to pay $2.5 million to employees and job applicants earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; over alleged pay and hiring discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzL65y"&gt;A Google spokesperson said in an email to The Verge that the company “strongly believes in the equity” of its policies and practices.  The spokesperson did not directly address the lawsuit’s class action status, but said the company has performed a “rigorous pay equity analysis” annually for the past eight years. “If we find any differences in proposed pay, including between men and women, we make upward adjustments to remove them before new compensation goes into effect,” the spokesperson added, saying that last year alone Google made “upward adjustments” for 2,352 employees across the company, for a total of $4.4 million. Google had over 135,000 employees as of December, and pulled in $17 billion in profit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22404046/google-alphabet-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;last quarter alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwdhKj"&gt;Dermody, the attorney, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; she expected a trial to start sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUnfFj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check if your Verizon or AT&amp;T phone will keep working after the networks’ 3G shutdowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell tower (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDf8X3YimwrbxzTcsIyKJga5Z18=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353302/cell-tower-stock_1020.1419980290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;US wireless carriers plan to shutter their old 3G networks next year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="93mvKT"&gt;Major US wireless carriers are gearing up to shut down their old 3G networks — a process that has been fraught with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; as companies alert customers with older phones that it’s time to upgrade. To that end, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have published guides to which devices will stop working after their 3G networks go offline next year. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP1RJt"&gt;Verizon has delayed its CDMA 3G network shutdown several times but is now firmly committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;shutting the network down by December 31st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. All 3G basic phones and smartphones will lose service, but some 4G devices will be impacted as well — namely, those that don’t support VoLTE (Voice over LTE). A few connected devices are affected, too; take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s full guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7DbZk"&gt;Taking the opposite approach, AT&amp;amp;T has published a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=100122946&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=38f3c68bbf2911eb81ee1d8c0a1c0e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-my-phone-work-on-att-after-3g-shutdown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) of exactly which phones, tablets, and smartwatches &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep working after its 3G shutdown on February 22nd, 2022. (Separately, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/atandts-3g-shutdown-plans-are-harmful-even-deadly-warns-alarm-industry/d/d-id/769737"&gt;concern in the alarm industry&lt;/a&gt;: many home security devices use AT&amp;amp;T’s 3G and it’s possible that users won’t be able to replace them in time.) In any case, AT&amp;amp;T makes it easy to understand which mobile devices will keep functioning after the network shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnH2r5"&gt;T-Mobile’s 3G shutdown is a bit more complicated. It operates a UMTS 3G network, which the company will &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/02/t-mobile-shutting-down-3g-network-on-october-1st/"&gt;reportedly shut down in April 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and Sprint’s former CDMA 3G network, which the company says it will sunset on January 1st, 2022. T-Mobile hasn’t published a list of affected devices, but customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresources%2Fbring-your-own-phone%23find-IMEI&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22457255%2Fverizon-att-3g-shutdown-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check their device’s IMEI&lt;/a&gt; to see if it’s LTE and VoLTE compatible, which should indicate whether the device will keep working after the 3G networks are taken offline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned the PS5’s controller can buzz along to your music on Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siG790W6r0aZmKNj9GxVHxqN2Cw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353225/vpavic_4261_20201023_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t need a PS5 for this trick.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DMHSEz"&gt;The DualSense controller for PS5 has great haptic feedback for games like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;. But today I found out that it’s also good at humming along to tunes on Spotify when plugged into a PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKj31x"&gt;While browsing Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/jlmlm4/dualsense_haptic_feedback_works_with_spotify_on_pc/"&gt;I stumbled across an ancient thread&lt;/a&gt; from six months ago where a user explained that, by plugging in a DualSense and tweaking a few settings, the device’s built-in haptics motors will do their best to play your music from the Spotify app on Windows 10. If you press your ear to the controller, it’s like listening into the world’s smallest rave ever, perhaps with a few Astro Bots in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8oweH"&gt;I assume you just ran to go get your controller to try this out — because that’s the same reaction that I had. Okay, but first lower your expectations before you get started. The haptics likely won’t blow you away, as they aren’t tuned for this particular use case — this is just for fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TCgo4B"&gt;Plug your controller into your PC via a USB-C cable and wait for Windows to automatically install the driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XYlJmp"&gt;Once it’s installed, tap the speaker icon near the bottom-right corner of your display where the time is shown. Set “Speakers (Wireless Controller)” as your audio output. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tRHE3r"&gt;Open the Control Panel and click “Sound.” From there, click on your current audio output and select the “Properties” button just below that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BgENbD"&gt;Click “Enhancements,” the third tab from the left on the pop-up window. Check the box next to “Speaker Fill,” then hit “Apply.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A6sJeM"&gt;You’ll need to restart the Spotify app for the haptic playback to begin. Once you start the app up again, you should be able to feel your music. You might even be able to hear the haptics motors doing their best at playing the music if you press the DualSense to your ear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YAmG41"&gt;If you actually want to listen to your music, in addition to feeling it in haptics form, just plug a set of headphones into the DualSense’s 3.5mm jack and the audio will be passed through. Your audio setup will look a little silly this way, but who cares?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sMEEVu"&gt;Here’s a track that I feel shows off the effect well. Click the Spotify logo in the top right of the embed to have the track open within the PC app:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch 14 minutes of stunning Horizon Forbidden West gameplay</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2vjZ2Z"&gt;Sony showed off 14 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; gameplay on a PS5 in a new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQATS4HOxdo"&gt;State of Play presentation on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. In the footage, protagonist Aloy fought against some giant animal-like machines and some human enemies on a beautiful post-apocalyptic beach settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFQ3Gf"&gt;The presentation revealed that Aloy has some new tools to get around in &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, like a diving mask to let her dive underwater and a &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;-like hang glider. And much like in the first game, it looks like you’ll still be slinging a lot of arrows against your enemies, both human and machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

The game is also coming to PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtOB52"&gt;We still don’t know when it will come out, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294561/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-release-date-2021-guerrilla-games-details-playstation"&gt;In 2020&lt;/a&gt;, developer Guerrilla Games said that it’s “aiming” to release &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, but &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/05/27/14-minutes-of-new-gameplay-for-horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Guerrilla’s Ben McCaw said that “we don’t have an exact release date yet, but development is on track and we’ll have an update for you very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A company wants to build a massive solar project in Montana — of course it’s for crypto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Berkeley Pit Superfund Site Forms Largest Body Of Contaminated Water In U.S." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9XLBH7TRANcy6yGv4gdhlUw7cw=/0x1:2171x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352908/811975228.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Janie Osborne/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tW0wB4"&gt;A company looking to build a massive solar project in Butte, Montana claims it would provide 300MW of renewable power and cost $250 million, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-solar-crypto-mine-plan-is-stranger-than-fiction-1846966085"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. That’s according to Madison River Equity LLC, whose parent company &lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/giant-solar-project-proposed-in-south-butte-landowners-concerned/article_653a61a1-d565-5f21-9639-0052f3df86e7.html"&gt;also manages cryptomining outfit Atlas Power&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;reports, Madison would build the solar array, then sell it to Atlas, which hopes to use it to power its cryptocurrency mining operations. If the solar farm, dubbed the Basin Creek Solar Project, is actually built, it could be one of the largest in the US, but it raises questions about the impact of such projects, and about crypto’s impact on energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60fFMI"&gt;While the project would theoretically allow Atlas’ mining and other data center operations to run on renewable power, there are arguments that green energy doesn’t actually make crypto itself green. There’s still the problem of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;e-waste that’s generated when hardware is no longer profitable&lt;/a&gt;, and the question of what will happen if there isn’t enough solar power available to fuel the mining operation. And while the massive solar project does seem to be in line with the goals of some (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451900/elon-musk-bitcoin-miners-council-sustainability"&gt;including Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;) in the crypto community who are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;trying to move away from fossil-fuel powered mining operations&lt;/a&gt;, it also shows the problems that can crop up when trying to create a green energy project, especially one that will be run by a company focusing on crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2k8qG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/giant-solar-project-proposed-in-south-butte-landowners-concerned/article_653a61a1-d565-5f21-9639-0052f3df86e7.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Montana Standard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Butte-Silver Bow zoning board recently turned down another energy project that was also looking to use residential land, citing nearby residents’ aesthetic concerns. The &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt;’s report also includes similar concerns from Butte residents about ruined views regarding the Basin Creek Solar Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3HjLP"&gt;There are also some community members concerned about whether the extra electricity generated will actually benefit Butte, or if it will be sold elsewhere. Add to that the allegedly colorful past of Atlas Power’s owners — the company &lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/atlas-power-kevin-washingtons-emerging-data-and-energy-vision/article_85d3a633-4a8a-5196-80c4-5f4a9a866ec2.html"&gt;used to be called CryptoWatt&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s understandable why residents would be wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A32lX8"&gt;At the moment, the fate of the Basin Creek Solar Project (and possibly the fate of Atlas Energy’s mining expansion) seem to be in the hands of the Butte-Silver Bow zoning board, which will meet on June 17th to discuss whether to allow the solar array to be built on what is currently private land.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Industry groups sue to stop Florida’s new social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Holds News Conference In Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9PlbO4oCVGw__P_iykqdT1IMy4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352761/1311497710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LU2mm"&gt;Two tech industry organizations have &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SB-7072-One-Pager-1.pdf"&gt;sued Florida&lt;/a&gt; over its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;newly passed rules&lt;/a&gt; for social networks. NetChoice and the CCIA — which represent Amazon, Google, Intel, Samsung, Facebook, and other tech giants — say SB 7072 violates private companies’ constitutional rights. They’re asking a court to prevent the law from taking effect, calling it a “frontal assault on the First Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKypyf"&gt;SB 7072, which Florida Governor Ron DeSantis &lt;a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/05/24/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-to-stop-the-censorship-of-floridians-by-big-tech/"&gt;signed earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, restricts how large social apps and websites can moderate user-generated content. It makes banning any Florida political candidate or “journalistic enterprise” unlawful, lets users sue if they believe they were banned without sufficient reason, requires an option to “opt out” of sorting algorithms, and places companies that break the law on an “antitrust violator blacklist” that bars them from doing business with public entities in Florida. Notably, it includes an exception for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;companies that operate a theme park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="STpCNW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A frontal assault on the First Amendment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eAP8j"&gt;NetChoice and the CCIA say SB 7072 conflicts with both constitutional protections and federal Section 230 rules. “As private businesses, Plaintiffs’ members have the right to decide what content is appropriate for their sites and platforms,” &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NetChoice-CCIA-Complaint-for-Declaratory-and-Injunctive-Relief-5.27.21.pdf"&gt;their complaint says&lt;/a&gt;. “The Act requires members to display and prioritize user-generated content that runs counter to their terms, policies, and business practices; content that will likely offend and repel their users and advertisers; and even content that is unlawful, dangerous to public health and national security, and grossly inappropriate for younger audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEm7vK"&gt;The lawsuit claims Florida lawmakers and DeSantis specifically tailored the law to punish services whose moderation policies they disagreed with, while adding the arbitrary theme park exception to pacify Disney, Comcast NBCUniversal, and a handful of other big companies. “The law is crony capitalism masquerading as consumer protection,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBsB2L"&gt;The law’s supporters argue it fights “deplatforming” of users based on political speech, saying social networks have “morphed into the town square” and become public spaces. Courts have contradicted the latter claim outside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20688860/trump-loss-knight-institute-second-circuit-court-twitter-block-lawsuit-analysis"&gt;extremely specific exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, determining that Section 230 mostly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272066/social-media-bias-laura-loomer-larry-klayman-twitter-google-facebook-loss"&gt;lets social networks&lt;/a&gt; make their own moderation decisions — and states can’t simply supersede that federal rule. However, the Florida bill let lawmakers and DeSantis signal support for a Republican backlash against Silicon Valley, whether or not it actually takes effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this incredible web series about a Cyberpunk Salad Merchant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRYrb23zfl5Ma-doa_AVj7TqMlo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352726/dynamoDreams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BHq5k8"&gt;After three years of production, Ian Hubert, king of the one-minute Blender tutorial, has uploaded &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGZ_2RuJ2A"&gt;the first episode&lt;/a&gt; of his sci-fi series, &lt;em&gt;Dynamo Dream&lt;/em&gt;. And it’s been worth the wait. The series is a mix of live-action and CGI that follows a salad merchant on a seemingly normal day through the dense streets of the Sunset District, a futuristic metropolis filled with fax machine drones, giant mutant crabs blocking traffic, and flying assassin bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2T1vf"&gt;The episode is visually stunning and seems to be endlessly filled with details. Every frame can be paused and observed, each containing hints to an expansive world that stretches beyond the camera’s frame. The world is convincing and surprisingly charming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HcLJR"&gt;While bearing resemblance to other gritty dystopias, the folky music, calm atmosphere, and moments of pause let you know that humanity isn’t totally lost in the world of &lt;em&gt;Dynamo Dream&lt;/em&gt;. There are still small joys to be found in the hustle and bustle. This continues into the protagonist, a merchant with a green thumb who sells salads in mugs. She’s a flower growing out of the cracks of the concrete, though things may not stay peaceful for long. Hopefully it won’t take another three years to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfDOmZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFJ_THGj72U?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shdszH"&gt;Over the years, Hubert has shared behind-the-scenes looks at this project and has become a well-known figure in the 3D art community — namely, for making impressive work with ingenious animation methods spotlighted in his Lazy Tutorials series on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmxZRQk-X0p-TOxd6PEYJA"&gt;his YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. His videos show you how to make a lot out of a little, often in under a minute’s time. Even more impressively, all 3D models used in this series were created using Blender, a free 3D package. Compositing was done using Adobe’s After Effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IW9Rg"&gt;You can check out a few of those tutorials below and support Hubert through his &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/IanHubert"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, where he shares tutorials and 3D assets with his patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s fantastic Chromebook Spin 713 is $329 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls9459Dk7Ed5zSMBhuRyEsAKPic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352519/mchin_181029_4126_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A84CFr"&gt;Acer just announced a new iteration of its Chromebook Spin 713 2-in-1 laptop, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;we’ve already reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps by coincidence (or not), the previous model has received a big price cut at Best Buy. You can get the starting model for $329, and it offers much more than many other Chromebooks in this price range. My colleague Monica Chin currently rates this 2020 Spin 713 as the best Chromebook that you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;Check out their buying guide&lt;/a&gt; to see how it stacks up to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgWQcw"&gt;The Spin 713 has a 13.5-inch 2K (2256 x 1504) 3:2 aspect ratio display that can show more content at once than comparatively squished 16:9 screens. Its battery life and build quality are great, and its 10th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage should provide a smooth experience for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H0r0tt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdleG2"&gt;In case this deal seems familiar, we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/19/22443621/roku-streambar-acer-chromebook-apple-watch-se-iphone-11-pro-deal-sale"&gt;a similar offer last week&lt;/a&gt; for the Spin 713 for $429, but that was for the upgraded model that has an i5 processor, and double the RAM and storage counts. That deal isn’t happening, unfortunately, but this is still a fantastic offer if you’re willing to take a small hit in those departments. The difference in performance isn’t likely to be drastic, but if you push your hardware to the limit, it might be worth waiting for another deal on the step-up configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
