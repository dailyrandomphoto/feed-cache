    <title>Steve Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson is writing a book about Elon Musk, says Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xdOO7uAIPsP47VoXgqfFckUun_8=/181x0:2131x1300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681691/elon_wario.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musk has an interesting relationship with his self-image, as evidenced by his appearance on SNL as Wario. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: SNL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngiZwA"&gt;Like most of the super-rich, Elon Musk has one eye on his legacy, keen to shape how his huge fortune is perceived now and in the future. This perhaps explains why he recently shared the fact that Walter Isaacson, biographer of Steve Jobs, is writing a book about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX69b5"&gt;“If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp;amp; my general goings on, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson"&gt;@WalterIsaacson&lt;/a&gt; is writing a biography,” tweeted Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTqGsh"&gt;He added in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423155872524558341"&gt;subsequent tweets&lt;/a&gt; that Isaacson has shadowed Musk “for several days so far,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423136151813050372"&gt;and that&lt;/a&gt; he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s biography of US founding father Benjamin Franklin. He also repeated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423105264010530821"&gt;that he will&lt;/a&gt; “maybe one day” write his own autobiography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4SGOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk says he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s book about Benjamin Franklin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmmV4x"&gt;There have been a number books written about Musk’s life and his career, including a 2015 biography, &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,&lt;/em&gt; by Ashlee Vance. The book, which Musk contributed several interviews to, was well received by reviewers. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10baeaea-ffab-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “a riveting portrait of Silicon Valley’s most driven entrepreneur [...] personal flaws and all,” while &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/books/elon-musk-a-biography-by-ashlee-vance-paints-a-driven-portrait.html"&gt;offered similar praise&lt;/a&gt;, though noted that the work occasionally veered “toward hagiography and the diction of news releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2iD8f"&gt;Musk has been less happy with other books written about him, though, including Tim Higgins’ recent &lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century, &lt;/em&gt;which was published earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmWxfR"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;review from &lt;em&gt;The LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says Higgins’ book “takes the shine off” Musk, showing him to be “a hair trigger of an executive who’s quick to fire people whether they deserve it or not.” The book has generated numerous news stories, including a particularly wild tale that Musk demanded to be made CEO of Apple after the iPhone-maker approached Tesla about an acquisition. Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;both denied that this ever happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwOxr"&gt;With Isaacson, though, Musk will likely know what to expect. Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was written with “unprecedented” access to the Apple founder and praised for its detail, readability, and emotional insight. But, as we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/27/2517152/book-review-steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson"&gt;noted in our own review&lt;/a&gt; from Laura June in 2011, the biography is also “in some respects [...] a book told through the often discussed ‘reality distortion field’ of Steve Jobs himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkFp0h"&gt;“[T]hough other opinions or sides to a story are presented, Steve always has the last, blunt word,” says June of Isaacson’s biography. That sounds like something Musk would like, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden wants half of new cars sold in 2030 to be hybrid or all-electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYfFbhG9on1mizR_sf6xbXNIWe0=/57x0:5064x3338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681656/1232967835.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gq7DU8"&gt;President Biden wants 50 percent of all new cars sold in the United States in 2030 to be all-electric, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen-powered — a goal he will lay out in an executive order later today, according to senior administration officials. In addition, his administration will propose new fuel economy and emissions standards that will more or less erase the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;rollback&lt;/a&gt; of the previous Obama-era rules covering cars made through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwuofZ"&gt;Biden will also sign an executive order that tasks the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop aggressive long-term rules to support his 2030 target, ones that include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOq35a"&gt;“When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking,” read a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627"&gt;tweet from the President on Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LnqGOd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking. Tune in for big news tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/riIClqPYnw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/riIClqPYnw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— President Biden (@POTUS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7KPgD"&gt;This planned shift away from internal combustion engines is not as aggressive as the approaches that have been proposed or set in motion around the world. The European Union has proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;a de-facto ban on sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, though France has pushed back on the phaseout of hybrids, which still use fossil fuels. The United Kingdom wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;stop selling new combustion engine vehicles by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. China &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/27/china-plans-2035-gas-car-ban-that-doesnt-actually-ban-gas-cars/"&gt;wants all new cars sold in 2035&lt;/a&gt; to be hybrids at the very least, but is aiming for 50 percent to be plug-in hybrid, battery electric, or hydrogen-powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="occUb0"&gt;California, ever the leader on state-level environmental regulations, is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to ban new gas cars&lt;/a&gt; by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoXcC8"&gt;On the policy side, the proposed rule from the NHTSA will look to lock in average annual fuel economy increases of just under four percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and an ultimate fleet-wide average of around 52 miles per gallon for 2026 model-year vehicles. Under the Obama-era rule, automakers had to increase the average fuel economy of their fleets by five percent each year, with the goal of hitting a fleet average of 54 miles per gallon in the 2026 model-year cars. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;lowered this dramatically&lt;/a&gt; — during a climate crisis and a respiratory virus pandemic, no less — to yearly increases of just 1.5 percent and a target average of 40 miles per gallon. It did this despite the EPA previously determining that automakers were “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17226192/epa-emissions-standards-old-data-fuel-automakers"&gt;over-complying&lt;/a&gt;” with the Obama-era rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC6QAY"&gt;The EPA, meanwhile, will propose a rule that requires emissions reductions that scale with the proposed fuel economy gains, as fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions are intrinsically linked. The two rule proposals will now go through a months-long public comment process before final rules are proposed and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5TVXu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Big Three Detroit Automakers are on board, mostly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9C7PXq"&gt;The Biden administration’s new proposals have already won support from some major automakers, which will separately announce their own goals for electrifying their fleets later today. Representatives from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (the company that was created when Fiat Chrysler merged with France’s PSA group) will appear alongside Biden as he announces the executive orders and proposed rules, as will leaders of the United Auto Workers union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiKaRc"&gt;That said, as was reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;those three Detroit automakers are only committing to a “shared aspiration” of 40 to 50 percent of new car sales being plug-ins by 2030. They’re also asking for the government to pitch in big time, not just on incentives for new electric vehicles, but also “incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States,” according to a press release. The Biden administration has been pushing to support electric vehicle adoption in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;the bipartisan infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, though some proposed investments (like for charging stations) have already been cut back in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CMuKE"&gt;GM has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;be carbon neutral by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and that eliminating tailpipe emissions from its vehicles by 2035 is merely an “aspiration.” Ford, which has found early success with the Mustang Mach-E, has committed to going all-electric by 2030 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker plans to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;40 percent of its fleet all-electric by that year&lt;/a&gt; globally. Stellantis had previously said more than 40 percent of its North American sales in 2030 &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/stellantis-ev-plans/"&gt;would be plug-in vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjurNO"&gt;While the Detroit automakers have announced massive investments in electric vehicles, they were certainly not as united on policy during the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjBYca"&gt;After the EPA and NHTSA moved to roll back the Obama-era standards under Trump, Ford (as well as Volkswagen, Honda, BMW, and Volvo) struck a deal with California to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;keep aiming at a relatively strict target&lt;/a&gt;. GM and what was still Fiat Chrysler at the time, meanwhile, actually joined the Trump administration’s fight in court over California’s right to set its own emissions standards. The automakers (along with Toyota) have maintained that they joined the court bid because they believed it should be up to the federal government to set these types of standards. But they have since abandoned that fight — GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;just after the 2020 election&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2021/02/02/fiat-chrysler-toyota-dump-trump-california-fight/4357446001/"&gt;Stellantis earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Biden’s EPA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;already moved to restore California’s emissions regulation authority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xo7i6b"&gt;All-electric vehicles currently only make up about &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/"&gt;two percent of total sales in the US&lt;/a&gt;, though they’ve jumped sharply in recent months as the new and used car markets have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;gotten red hot&lt;/a&gt;. More than 100,000 fully electric vehicles were sold in the US in the second quarter of 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/electrified-vehicle-sales-accelerate-in-q2/"&gt;Kelley Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, driven in large part by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;success of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV&lt;/a&gt;. But hybrid vehicle sales were up, too, with more than 250,000 sold — a 200-percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo profits decline year-on-year as Switch hits 89 million sold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kvkkg6ZtST_5x51GN6u6_8e6h74=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681638/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kM5x0e"&gt;Nintendo has released its earnings for the April-June quarter, and while the figures would normally be strong for what’s usually a slow period, revenue and profit are both down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356750/nintendo-earnings-q1-2020-switch-animal-crossing-sales"&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. That’s perhaps not surprising given the company was then riding a surge in demand for video games during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and had just released the mega-hit &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58WzGM"&gt;By comparison, Switch hardware sales were down 21.7 percent to 4.45 million units, and software sales decreased 10.2 percent to 45.29 million units. Nintendo has now sold 89.04 million Switch consoles in total; for comparison, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;just hit 10 million&lt;/a&gt;. Revenue decreased 9.9 percent to 322.6 billion yen ($2.94 billion), while operating profit was 119.6 billion yen ($1.09 billion), a 17.3-percent decline year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s now sold nearly 34 million copies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l1MRj"&gt;Nintendo’s biggest release this current quarter is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which came out last month. The company can expect a boost in Switch hardware sales next quarter due to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;new OLED model&lt;/a&gt; in October, even though it isn’t bringing the widely expected upgrade in power. Nintendo’s slate of games for that all-important holiday quarter includes &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, and remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines will let you watch 30 minutes of TikTok in the air for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airfield At Miami International Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TlDp_ZUENTpTBOyZ58ZSzQeHdg=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680846/1323904371.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGSpgm"&gt;Free TikTok has arrived on some of American Airlines’ flights, according to &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Passengers will be able to use the app for up to 30 minutes for free, which gives them time to watch at least ten of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;new, longer TikToks&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have the app already installed, the airline says you’ll be able to download it for free while in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gHbI"&gt;The move to make TikTok available to travelers comes as airlines are trying to get attention back on flying, after the &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/march-2021-airline-passenger-volume-shows-signs-aviation-recovery"&gt;number of people traveling&lt;/a&gt; by air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;dropped during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. One of its competitors, United, has also been adding tech upgrades to its fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596430/united-airlines-preorder-food-drink-website-app"&gt;allowing passengers to pre-order in-flight snacks&lt;/a&gt; and adding planes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;support bluetooth audio for the in-seat screens&lt;/a&gt;. American has &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2020/12/16/american-airlines-to-offer-free-inflight-messaging-and-new-priority-boarding-perks/"&gt;recently allowed passengers to use Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; for free in-flight, giving them at least some connection to the outside world — something that some of its competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16375474/delta-free-in-flight-messaging-whatsapp-imessage-facebook-planes-gogo"&gt;have done for years&lt;/a&gt; for it and other messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3cFsL"&gt;According to the airline’s press release, the promotion is a “trial.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that customer response will determine how long the trial will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peD9CB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline suggests TikToks about travel and finance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJKNh"&gt;If you’re planning your flights around free TikTok, it’s probably worth keeping in mind that it doesn’t seem like every flight will have access to it. American Airlines specifies that the promotional offer is limited to narrow-body aircraft that have Viasat Wi-Fi systems. A lot of planes in &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/planes/planes.jsp"&gt;the airline’s fleet&lt;/a&gt; seem to count as narrow-body, but planes like the Boeing 787 &lt;a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/widebody/"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. American also uses &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/entertainment/wi-fi-and-connectivity.jsp"&gt;a few Wi-Fi providers for its flights&lt;/a&gt;, so even if a flight has Wi-Fi there’s a chance it won’t be from Viasat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUy2wE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;airline’s press release&lt;/a&gt; tells its passengers that they can expect to find a ton of content on the platform, including “travel inspiration” and “career advice.” While it’s hard to imagine many people sitting on a plane watching TikToks about how to make a resumé, spending a half hour looking up short videos about wherever you’re going isn’t actually the worst idea. Let’s just hope that your time isn’t eaten up by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610175/amazon-tiktok-fake-ad-flo-rida-low-roblox-apple-bottom-jeans"&gt;bizarre fake ads with Flo Rida songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Draw like it’s 1989 with this Kid Pix web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4aEg4mzod4J2sK3tu2QmiVWMAaA=/45x0:1212x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680744/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.18.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rSr7iX"&gt;Kid Pix, an iconic piece of kid-friendly desktop art software, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000/status/1423014244644122627"&gt;has been ported to Javascript and HTML&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000"&gt;Vikrum Nijjar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;The web version of Kid Pix&lt;/a&gt; is based one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix#Kid_Pix_5:_The_S.T.E.A.M._Edition"&gt;the original 1.0 version released for Macs in 1989&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Kixm8"&gt;It has the expected tools like paint brushes, rubber stamps, shapes, and letters, all scored by Kid Pix’s highly memorable sound effects. The sounds and Kid Pix’s somewhat inscrutable interface are the real draw here. The program’s inherent playfulness encourages you to explore, even if you’re not a kid anymore. You can see a spokesperson from Kid Pix’s first publisher Broderbund &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TayProAkmBE"&gt;talk through some of the original app’s features&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rRjjlG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TayProAkmBE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6D1qw9"&gt;I didn’t remember using Kid Pix at first, but pulling up the web version of Kid Pix and stamping a random assortment of strawberries only to be greeted with the app’s distinct THWACK sound effect, immediately confirmed that yes, I am child of the 90s. You might be similarly stirred by the dull KABOOM paired with Kid Pix’s “Firecracker” tool. Or the bizarre WOOOW that accompanies the “Doorbell” tool. Kid Pix is refreshingly weird in a way that most software isn’t in our polished, user-friendly 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0fb5ZKdwh5ZJrMCCvleJZgwN1J0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762429/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.09.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some casual Kid Pix art can be quite good, in my opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ob8CDg"&gt;It’s fun to take a trip down memory lane, and loading up a website in your browser is a lot easier than digging up a version of Kid Pix that will actually run on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YvEEg"&gt;You can try Kid Pix now, &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;right from your browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 may give the iPhone’s camera an upgrade: fewer green flares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1EEmaRhJrnLZ3NJ4cvReKzmsJg=/0x199:2388x1791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680500/IMG_2220.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtVSH9"&gt;The latest version of Apple’s iOS 15 beta seems to be making subtle improvements to photos by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor pictures (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). News of the feature was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted to the iOSBeta subreddit&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit user Doubleluckstur, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to see it in action by testing with an iPhone 12 Mini running the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xNJPR"&gt;Many iPhone users will be familiar with the green blobs, and while taking a picture it seems like nothing’s changed — the flare still shows up in the viewfinder. But when you go to view the final picture, the flare is nowhere to be seen (in some cases; we’ll get to that in a bit). It does seem to be the result of all the post-processing that’s done to the picture, as the flare shows up in the alternate (and less-processed) frames that are available if you’re using Apple’s Live Photo feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxjdgr8cE301KrCX9jJufRFYiWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762173/RPReplay_Final1628109977_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green dot shows up in the viewfinder and Live Photo, but not the processed still.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="AsRhIt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10686247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYq911"&gt;So far it’s a bit unclear which iPhone models the processing happens on. In the Reddit thread, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7mecjl?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one user reports&lt;/a&gt; also seeing the green dot removal on their iPhone XS, while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7ohj3r?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;another says&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t work on their iPhone 8 Plus. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the feature could be limited to phones with an A12 Bionic processor or newer (so the XS and XR onward). The feature only being available on newer phones wouldn’t necessarily be surprising: some of iOS 15’s features, like Live Text or Portrait mode for FaceTime, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;already have the A12 Bionic listed as a requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCaB9M"&gt;Of course, with this discovery came people trying to chase it down and find its limitations. Reddit user -DementedAvenger- &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7lopz8?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted examples of the flare still showing up&lt;/a&gt; on top of trees or mesh bug-proof window screens, as well as flares that came from a bathroom light instead of the sun. I was also able to replicate his tree example, as well as get some indoor flares of my own (though it’s worth noting that they’re not the same green bubble flares that so often occur from the sun).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hZxs_ku6WSu6_mljI9EFsGlbqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762112/IMG_2212.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get flares if you’re really trying, especially indoors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgXtxl0S2tqx2T5xF7vvSu3o7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762119/IMG_2215.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the flare on the right side of the tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOvsrd"&gt;Another limitation is video: I couldn’t find any scenarios where flares showed up any differently in the final video than they did in the viewfinder. Of course, removing a lens flare from 30 or 60 frames per second 4K footage would be quite a bit more computationally intensive, and have a greater chance of looking a bit weird, so it’s not necessarily surprising that the feature seems to be photo-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GK_C-ZGCEC5do2EfQTAGN9UifT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762271/RPReplay_Final1628115178_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gif compression turns it white, but the flare is still clearly visible in this video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNn8s7"&gt;As always with beta features, the functionality we’re seeing here could be different with the next release, or gone altogether. Still, it seems that Apple is at least experimenting with getting rid of the green blobs that can crop up in images from time to time, and it would be a welcome thing to see in the final version of iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook streamlines the settings page on mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeaYdozU55jXG8f3rO9Z0346mqc=/10x0:1398x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680466/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.36.00_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Facebook settings page compared to the new one on mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS, mobile web, and Facebook Lite. You might already have the redesign — I just checked the Facebook app on my iPhone 12 Mini and it loaded up. It was present on the mobile web for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Job alert: ‘Spaceport Mixologist’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWdvmKssy8krvMlsL_TsZbrgxhE=/0x44:921x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680227/Es7VmxuXEAASF3t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Two since-destroyed Starship prototypes stand erect at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas Starship facilities. | Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TKrWkf"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is seeking a “Spaceport Mixologist” who can whip up space-themed drinks next to the company’s sprawling rocket factory in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdZiaL"&gt;While space itself likely won’t be in their future, an experienced bartender — who will have one of the coolest job titles — will be tapped to join the hundreds of employees working on SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket system in rural Boca Chica, Texas. The mixologist will probably work out of the small house next to SpaceX’s budding spaceport that Musk calls the Starbase Tiki Bar and sling tiki drinks like the Test Pilot or Jet Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoHyQA"&gt;“Experience pairing drinks with a themed menu” is on the list of preferred skills. “SpaceX has a number of food service outlets and formats serving our workforce and are looking to add many more. We are searching for candidates who have superior mixology experience with a focus in resorts, bars, and full service restaurants,” the &lt;a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/5417887002?gh_jid=5417887002"&gt;job description&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7FZX_9P9raomLH92Iochok7z6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762142/Ek4Pea_X0AAJC6b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of a drink at SpaceX’s tiki bar, according to Musk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYlqGE"&gt;Also at SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1347973060943609856?s=20"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; and another bar in one of the company’s rocket-building towers that overlooks the whole spaceport. Musk calls that bar “High Bar” — in the “high bay” of the tower — and has described it as a “futuristic bar” with “360 degree windows &amp;amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory.” SpaceX &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TylerG1998/status/1408984275354013697?s=20"&gt;hosted a party&lt;/a&gt; at the High Bar in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BgsWkd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Real pic of 2 ships next to Starbase Tiki Bar on right &lt;a href="https://t.co/E4awziEdDQ"&gt;https://t.co/E4awziEdDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1405597886826512386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHuoof"&gt;SpaceX is staffing dozens of food service jobs at locations in Texas and California to feed the company’s growing workforce. Cooks, baristas and sous chefs are among the open positions under the food services category of SpaceX’s jobs page. While SpaceX’s food establishments mainly serve its own employees, the public might not be left out for long. “I super support public spaces around our production &amp;amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347977322364694528?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in January. “When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp;amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr4Aq"&gt;It’s not unusual for big tech and aerospace companies to employ chefs and baristas to serve their employees. From Facebook to Google to Boeing, they all have chefs and baristas, according to LinkedIn, and SpaceX has several chefs and baristas as well. But &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been able to find evidence of any in-house mixologists at other companies. One of Musk’s other companies, Neuralink, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421622513918955524?s=20"&gt;just built it’s own bar&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear whether the brain interface startup employs its own mixologist yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLucCb"&gt;SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is in its infancy, but it could one day send humans to the Moon — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;won a contract from NASA in April&lt;/a&gt; to launch the first US astronauts to the lunar surface since 1972. But before that moonshot happens, and probably before the tiki bar and restaurant open to the public, SpaceX has a ways to go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22352366/elon-musk-spacex-faa-warnings-starship-sn8-launch-violation-texas"&gt;‘maturing’ the more critical functions&lt;/a&gt; at Musk’s Starbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONzepy"&gt;Apple has placed senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik on indefinite administrative leave after she tweeted about sexism in the office. The company is currently investigating claims Gjøvik made about a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaR7F"&gt;“For months, I have been raising concerns with Apple employee relations about years of experiences with sexism, a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, and retaliation,” Gjøvik says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added that if there was no other option they could give me paid administrative leave. They apparently made no effort to set boundaries and instead said they were placing me on administrative leave and implied they did not want me on Slack where I had been vocal about my concerns with certain policies at the company. They also implied they didn’t want me to meet one-on-one with other women at the company about their concerns with Apple policies, which I had been doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYW22k"&gt;This afternoon, Gjøvik set an out of office message informing colleagues that the employee relations team had placed her on indefinite paid leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dpRzyx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, following raising concerns to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hostileworkenvironment?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hostileworkenvironment&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unsafeworkconditions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unsafeworkconditions&lt;/a&gt;, I'm now on indefinite paid administrative leave per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations, while they investigate my concerns. This seems to include me not using Apple's internal Slack.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1423014977661591552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTXTo"&gt;This is the second time Apple has investigated Gjøvik’s claims about sex discrimination at the company. The employee relations team closed an earlier investigation, allegedly finding that nothing was wrong, prompting Gjøvik to tweet screenshots with what she says is just a small portion of what she experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4YgO7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wanted to share: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations confirmed this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tonepolicing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#tonepolicing&lt;/a&gt; is totally ok feedback for me to get from my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigtech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bigtech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/male?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#male&lt;/a&gt; leaders &amp;amp; not &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexist?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As this investigation rolls on, I've decided to start Tweeting the stuff they say is "ok." I mean, they did say it was ok? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EImLTjRTBl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EImLTjRTBl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422380335703101443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z3eNab"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In today's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations said its fine update, here's the heartfelt email I sent my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigtech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bigtech&lt;/a&gt; male leadership in 2018 during the Kavanaugh hearings. I asked for support of women &amp;amp; to condemn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexualassault?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexualassault&lt;/a&gt;. The reply: a text saying "FWIW, RBG thinks he's ok." &lt;a href="https://t.co/0GTthZNEgH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0GTthZNEgH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422953562724737024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="f11v2A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This happened to me at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; too: they offered EAP and suggested medical leave after I spoke up about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/discrimination?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, and a hostile work environment. They also suggested requesting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ADA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/disability?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#disability&lt;/a&gt; accommodations after I raised concerns about unsafe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/workconditions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#workconditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LW0Ueq1Leb"&gt;https://t.co/LW0Ueq1Leb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcnq6"&gt;Apple is currently contending with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism&lt;/a&gt;, including multiple women tweeting about their dissatisfaction with the company culture. In May, employees wrote a letter demanding an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, who’d written a book about Silicon Valley with descriptions of women many people found offensive.  Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvqKiC"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playdate’s first season of games won’t hit every handheld at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2B-kXc-6jJ_pGhWGuNVo3EU3fo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679840/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ktTm2"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Panic’s Playdate&lt;/a&gt; — besides its lovely crank — is the unique game delivery method that will bring 24 free games to the device. Panic plans to release a season of games (Season One), two games at a time each week. &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/games/season/"&gt;In a new FAQ released on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Panic explains a bit more about how that’ll work and reveals that, due to limited manufacturing capacity, not everyone will be playing new games at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYcxYQ"&gt;All Playdates will download new games weekly on “New Game Day” as long they’re connected to Wi-Fi, starting with the first two games when you connect your device. The catch is that not everyone will connect their Playdate to the internet on day one due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;limited preorders&lt;/a&gt;. That means rather than being in sync with the entire Playdate population (what Panic’s original “season of games” pitch implied), players will instead receive games in more or less the same cadence as the people in their preorder batch. Panic explains that this slight adjustment is due to what level of manufacturing and distribution is possible during the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xlGUGp"&gt;Our initial dream was a fully synchronized season for every owner, but that turned out to be really really hard to do with the reality of manufacturing (the factory can only make so many a week!) and distribution (international package delivery is only so reliable!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZFI1h"&gt;If Panic does decide to do a Season Two of games,  it says it should be able to pull off its original plan since many people will already own Playdates. The company also makes it clear that even though the Playdate will automatically download games, you don’t have to be committed to them. You can delete and re-download games at any time if you need to make room on your device for other homemade titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfUTqk"&gt;You can see our impression of the Playdate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;in our hands-on here&lt;/a&gt; and a preview of what games Panic has lined up for Season One &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;on its Playdate site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
