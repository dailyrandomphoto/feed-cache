    <title>Targus announces an antimicrobial keyboard light and backpack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEbt0Y08-IstlMd97Qt0ZBiJdYk=/21x182:616x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652214/20_340___Press_Release_UV_C_Light_1024x1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GOj2h2"&gt;Targus is an accessory manufacturer that’s been around for a long time, and its &lt;a href="https://content.targus.com/ces21/"&gt;slate of CES products&lt;/a&gt; this year center on three main themes: portability, sustainability, and, of course, staying healthy during a pandemic (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCt1tqFmUL4zDqcth4vEOsydmL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228534/20_340___Press_Release_UV_C_Light_1024x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UV-C LED Disinfection light uses UV light to kill microbes on anything in its cleaning area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AfR7vV"&gt;The company’s banner products for pandemic health are the 2Office antimicrobial backpack and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Fstrong-targus-named-ces-2021-innovation-awards-honoree-for-its-uv-c-led-disinfection-light&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225509%2Ftargus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UV-C LED Disinfection Light&lt;/a&gt;. The light is designed to sit above your keyboard and mouse and bathe them in UV-C light to help eliminate microorganisms that may be kicking around on your high-touch accessories. It automatically turns on for five minutes every hour, but you shouldn’t have to worry about it interrupting your work: it uses motion sensors to detect if you’re using your computer, and will wait to begin its cleaning cycle until you’re away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZSeKF"&gt;If you’re not interested in a UV light to clean off your keyboard and mouse (though, really, it could be used for anything), Targus also announced that it’s working on antimicrobial mice and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaZrGBbH56DwluJjaD6NHjUJARw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228597/c8bb423b_tbb615gl_70_detail2_10pa0p80pa0i600002e028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The backpack and tablet cases promise to kill microbes on “key touchpoints.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MSBt62"&gt;The 2Office backpack, which can hold laptops that are up to 17.3 inches, has an antimicrobial coating on “key touchpoints.” The bag could be useful if you have to go out in a pandemic, but I can think of other uses for an antimicrobial bag when travel starts back up again. (Who else has felt weird hanging their backpack on a bathroom door?) If you’re not looking for an entirely new backpack, the company also announced antimicrobial tablet cases, along with antimicrobial privacy screens for select computer monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQbnXC"&gt;The company has also announced a dock and rugged case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3. The dock uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837263/samsung-dex-note-10-plus-palm-foleo-motorola-atrix-celio-redfly"&gt;Samsung’s DeX software&lt;/a&gt; that lets you connect the tablet to a monitor for a more desktop-like experience. For iPad owners, Targus has also announced an EcoSmart case, which is made out of recycled materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hYbyl"&gt;Finally, Targus has announced new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fcollections%2Fprivacy-screens&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225509%2Ftargus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;antimicrobial privacy screens&lt;/a&gt;, which cost anywhere between $35 and $185, depending on the devices they are meant for. The screens are available now, with the rest of the announced devices coming this spring. Currently, no prices or exact dates have been provided for those. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable has a 12-inch screen that’s, well, detachable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Detatchable in laptop mode, angled to the left side." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoPozd3QEHV1mTLhJzC2dcS-QA4=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652122/03_Thinkpad_X12_Hero_Front_Facing_Right.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pt5ZdU"&gt;Lenovo is introducing a new ThinkPad — with a twist. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is a 12.3-inch business laptop with a screen that you can pop off and use as a tablet. It’s one of several new ThinkPads Lenovo has launched this week, which are powered by Intel’s newest 11th Gen vPro processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuAOX1"&gt;Take a look at this thing, and you’ll see that it’s a similar idea to Microsoft’s Surface Pro line. The display is essentially a 12.3-inch Windows tablet that you can attach to and detach from a folio keyboard. It has a kickstand on the back, which is how it stands up on its own, and it’s compatible with Lenovo’s Precision Pen and Digital Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wXBRG"&gt;The form factor is meant to offer extra versatility to business users. If you’re in a meeting or class, for example, and need to read presentation notes off your computer, you can pop the screen off without having to lug the keyboard up with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Clwiqx"&gt;Even with the keyboard attached, though, portability is still a selling point. The tablet is less than 9 mm thick and weighs just over 2.5 pounds with the keyboard attached. It also supports LTE Cat9 for on-the-go work, and Lenovo says it’s undergone MIL-SPEC 810G testing to certify that it’s durable enough to withstand drops and jostles during travel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detatchable in tablet mode, being written on with a stylus." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fq5wgnlqZEBw-sJNUkkyFH68JA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223439/05_Thinkpad_X12_Screen_Hero_Front_Facing_Right.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBfbsd"&gt;But despite its tablet-esque form factor, the ThinkPad X12 is still very much a laptop because it has laptop chips inside. It’s powered by Intel’s 11th Gen Core vPro processors (up to a Core i7 ) and Iris Xe integrated graphics. Intel’s vPro platform brings a number of security features for business users. In terms of other specs, you can get up to 16GB of LPDDR4x memory and 1TB of NVMe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtOD3"&gt;In terms of ports, don’t get too excited: there’s a whopping one Thunderbolt 4, one USB 3.2 Type-C, one NanoSIM, and one audio jack. Remember that one of those ports will sometimes hold the charger, so if you’re buying the X12 and will need to plug other things in, you’ll probably want a dock of some sort (such as Kensington’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219031/kensingtons-sd5700t-thunderbolt-4-dock-90w-charging"&gt;SD5700T Thunderbolt 4 station&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detatchable in laptop mode, seen from the back with the kickstand unfolded." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5uodAMeGuIeFsL-9PusxILxoDHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223441/04_Thinkpad_X12_Hero_Rear_Facing_Right.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpIudm"&gt;A feature I’m quite excited about is the aspect ratio. The X12 has a 3:2 display, the same dimensions as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been nice to see manufacturers across the board abandon the cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, and 3:2 is my favorite kind of screen to use. It gives you a bunch of extra space for multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qty4Q"&gt;I recently reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, another device built like a tablet that comes with a keyboard. It’s a very cool device, but at $2,499, it’s too expensive for me to recommend any human actually buy. The X12 Detachable is what I’d call a more pragmatic implementation of the X1 Fold. It’s not as fancy (for one, the screen doesn’t fold in half) but it’s significantly less expensive with a starting price of $1,149, and it looks like it comes with a full-sized keyboard rather than the tiny cramped one that came with the Fold. For many users looking for a convertible ThinkPad, the X12 Detachable may be a more sensible choice (though I’ll have to see how it performs before making an official recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9LrNt"&gt;The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is expected to be available in January 2021, starting at $1,149.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga is less than half an inch thick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga seen from above, with dotted swirls around the locations of the speakers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOZlpHQKlZAQ3w-jZxT0plXniAU=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652123/06_TP_X1_Titanium_Hero_Dolby_Speakers.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The ThinkPad X1 Titanium supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. | Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OOu7M"&gt;Lenovo announced a bunch of additions to its ThinkPad line today, headlined by the new X1 Titanium Yoga. The convertible X1 Titanium is covered in what Lenovo calls “titanium material” and is just 0.45 inches (11.5 mm) thick. It also has a 3:2 2K touch display that can reach 450 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvjhQ4"&gt;Inside, the X1 Titanium Yoga is powered by Intel’s latest 11th Gen Core i7 vPro processors. It’s Intel Evo certified (meaning Intel vouches for its performance, features, and battery life) along with most of the X1 portfolio. You can configure it with up to 16GB memory and 1TB of of PCIe SSD storage, and it includes 5G connectivity and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVOmdx"&gt;The X1 Titanium Yoga will start at $1,899. You should be able to buy it this month. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 seen from the front." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6i13r4ugs_1yWuP157qVxn1OPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227515/01_X1_Carbon_G9_Hero_Front_Facing_CARBON.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 comes with optional 5G and Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h063Ks"&gt;Lenovo has added a few other ThinkPads to its lineup this year. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 and ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 are the first two laptops to support Dolby Voice, which Lenovo says will deliver a videoconferencing experience that “feels more natural, reduces listener fatigue, and sounds stunningly clear.” They also include a low blue-light feature, fingerprint readers integrated into the power button, and presence-detection sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xceeYN"&gt;The X1 Carbon Gen 9 has a new 16:10 screen and rear venting, as well as a wider touchpad and larger battery than its previous generation. It’ll be available starting at $1,429 in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The X1 Yoga Gen 6 angled to the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AiVjWXjJzCwlvcH3Z9B7jXXtlfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227532/05_X1_Yoga_G6_Hero_Front_Facing_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the X1 Yoga Gen 6 delivers up to 15 hours of battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7CvCiF"&gt;The X1 Yoga Gen 6 also has a 16:10 display, bigger battery, and wider touchpad, but also comes in a new “Storm Gray” color. That will also be available in February, starting at $1,569. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNdUlW"&gt;Last week, Lenovo also announced a new batch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217872/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-laptop-amd-ryzen-ces-2021"&gt;IdeaPad laptops&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217345/lenovo-aio-7-rotating-display-all-in-one-ces-2021-desktop"&gt;all-in-one system&lt;/a&gt; with a rotating display. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dolby wants to boost the audio quality of your laptop’s video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihipCxoYYR36UDZbGSbjNMjnJRA=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652116/dolby_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOBzoH"&gt;Two of Lenovo’s upcoming laptops will be the first to feature Dolby Voice, an audio technology that’s aimed at making it easier to hear people during conference calls. The feature combines elements like background noise reduction and dynamic leveling to make meetings sound “clearer, more natural, and feel less fatiguing,” Dolby says. Lenovo’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21988798"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 and X1 Yoga Gen 6&lt;/a&gt; laptops will both include the technology, but Dolby declined to say which other laptops it might come to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJABT"&gt;Dolby Voice isn’t exactly a brand-new piece of technology. Dolby has previously used similar underlying tech for its &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/product/dolby-voice/dolby-conference-phone/"&gt;Dolby Conference Phone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/product/dolby-voice/dolby-voice-room/"&gt;Dolby Voice Room&lt;/a&gt;, which were both business-focused conferencing solutions. The difference is that now it’ll be available directly in a pair of laptops without needing separate &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/communications/"&gt;Dolby hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fafiEo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The aim is to make calls sound “clearer, more natural, and feel less fatiguing” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5hX3g"&gt;The technology includes a couple of different features that work together with your speakers and microphones to make call audio easier to hear. “Full room pick up and dynamic leveling” adjust a call’s audio to make it easier to hear people who are quieter or farther away from the microphone. Voice also includes noise reduction to eliminate echo and background noise. Finally, Dolby says Voice makes speech easier to hear when there are multiple people talking on the same call thanks to a “voice separation” feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45RlhA"&gt;The technology works on both incoming and outgoing audio, so you should sound clearer to the people you’re talking with, and you’ll also hear a benefit. Dolby Voice’s features can be controlled via the Dolby Access app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjBntj"&gt;Your combination of hardware and software will determine which of these features can be used. Dolby says full room pick up, dynamic leveling, and noise reduction all work “out of the box” with the two laptops, regardless of which software is being used. External 3.5mm microphones plugged into a laptop can also benefit from noise suppression and dynamic leveling. However, the requirements for the voice separation feature are a little higher, and the feature will only work when using the laptop’s built-in microphones with select services including Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9wUvB"&gt;Since many people have been staying at home over the past year, there’s been a surge of interest in using software to improve the quality of audio during calls. Some chat services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216534/discord-background-noise-suppression-krisp-beta-feature"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285011/google-meet-background-noise-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt; have built background noise reduction tech directly into their services, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;Nvidia’s Broadcast software&lt;/a&gt; works across different chat apps, so long as you have the right (Nvidia) hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibsS6B"&gt;Dolby Voice could combine the best parts of the two approaches. Its features aren’t necessarily confined to any one chat service, nor does it require a ray tracing-capable graphics card. We should know how well it performs when Lenovo’s two compatible laptops launch in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s latest 11th Gen H-series chips promise the fastest ultraportable gaming laptops yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRhha4Hl6SowhPlAp9ZSo9ezvCw=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652117/intel_core.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QrFK2"&gt;After releasing its first wave of 11th Gen Tiger Lake processors last year, Intel is kicking things up a notch at CES 2021 with its first H-series 11th Gen Core chips, which will bring the benefits of Tiger Lake (like the 10nm process and the overhauled Xe integrated graphics) to even more powerful machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2fYgH"&gt;There is a catch, though: the first wave of 11th Gen H-series chips will be the lower end of that bracket, maxing out at 35W processors — instead of the more powerful 45W chips that represent the top of Intel’s gaming laptop range. (The company is still working on those models, which it promises to have more details on in the near future.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2OdJFQnnIoVkPgDmGs3Pej8W9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228391/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_2.55.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8UJorc"&gt;So while the new 35W H-series chips won’t be the processors found in the beefiest and best gaming laptops money can buy, they will offer some pretty impressive performance — meaning smaller or lighter laptops could start punching above their weight class, even with smaller core counts and less thermal headroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30FdHkI-3EHjbIGART_PgD348Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228273/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_2.23.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vnYPGS"&gt;Specifically, Intel is touting that its new i7-11375H — the top-of-the-line model in the H35 lineup, with four cores, eight threads, and a boosted clock speed of up to 5GHz — offers the fastest single-thread performance of any laptop, matched only by Intel’s best 45W H-series chip from last year. It’s impressive, especially considering that the new model has less raw power to work with here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YcnUDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s new 10th Gen chips bring 5.0GHz clock speeds to gaming laptops","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21203222/intel-10th-gen-h-series-laptop-processors-comet-lake-14nm-5-ghz-clock-speeds-gaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DFa0sU"&gt;The new chips will also support Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, feature integrated Thunderbolt 4 support, DDR4 memory at up to 3,200 MHz and LPDDR4/x at up to 4,266 MHz, and PCIe Gen 4.0. As for graphics, hardware companies will be able to either rely on the already impressive integrated Xe-LP graphics or add additional discreet options from companies like Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDLwCg"&gt;And while the lack of even more powerful 11th Gen laptop chips may be disappointing to some, Intel did start teasing what to expect next: an 8-core processor that will start shipping “later this quarter” with speeds up to 5GHz, although details on that are still slim.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BU3gG0Pcxvi5L6IYreWGIA-b1z0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228687/bandicam_2021_01_11_16_28_28_853.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dHEaeH"&gt;The first laptops powered by the new 11th Gen H35 chips are expected to be announced at CES 2021, including models from Acer, Asus, MSI, and Vaio, with Intel expecting over 40 designs released in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen chips look to challenge Arm and Apple’s M1 CPUs later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y43DoI3WsPyzDM0YT-AheS0TnHw=/169x0:2095x1284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652131/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.30.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQM1CZ"&gt;Intel took the time at CES to offer a preview of its &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; major chip release: its hybrid Alder Lake chipsets, which — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/13/21365544/intel-tiger-lake-11th-gen-xe-graphics-gpu-preview-first-look-architecture-day-2020"&gt;like its Lakefield predecessor&lt;/a&gt; — will utilize an approach similar to &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/big-little"&gt;Arm’s BIG.little&lt;/a&gt; technology, using high-performance and high-efficiency cores in a single package to maximize both power and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXtwj1"&gt;But where the Lakefield chips were largely focused on mobile devices, Intel says that Alder Lake will help serve as the foundation for future desktop and mobile processors instead, with the first products using this “most power-scalable system-on-chip” set to arrive in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9YPAQn-oSLjFjW42W4tKSjISgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228697/bandicam_2021_01_11_16_30_54_671.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DwMLl7"&gt;The 12th Gen Alder Lake chips will feature a “new, enhanced version” of the 10nm SuperFin designs already found in Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips, with a combination of new high-power cores it’s calling Golden Lake and new Gracemont cores for efficiency. (Tiger Lake’s CPU cores were known as Willow Cove.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO5Y8c"&gt;But what’s notable is Intel’s scope here, with plans for hybrid chips that will scale far beyond simple mobile devices. The timing is particularly apt: the Alder Lake chips represent Intel’s closest product to Arm-based chips that are built like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;the game-changing M1 processors that Apple introduced in November&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that Intel is looking to scale its hybrid chips across its lineup could indicate that the company is looking to emulate Apple’s Arm success with its own technology going forward — an intriguing idea, particularly as Intel’s more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;traditional chip strategies&lt;/a&gt; continue to face delays. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s new Core i9-11900K flagship processor will arrive in early 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nuzJfhB22O7yY35Q0NCSu7v8XAU=/79x0:1003x616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652118/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_3.46.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qevLC8"&gt;Intel’s new flagship Core i9-11900K processor will arrive in the first quarter of 2021. The chipmaker has provided the latest preview for its first 11th Gen (Rocket Lake-S) desktop chips at CES today. Headlined by the flagship Core i9-11900K, the new chips are said to bring up to 19 percent higher IPC (instructions per cycle), up to 50 percent better integrated graphics, and better AI performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfCzLl"&gt;And while Intel isn’t quite ready to take the lid off the full 11th Gen Rocket Lake-S lineup just yet, it did preview the flagship Core i9 model: an eight-core, 16-thread chipset with boosted clock speeds up to a whopping 5.3GHz. The processor also includes support for DDR4 RAM at 3,200MHz, a total of 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and even backwards compatibility with Intel’s 400 Series chipsets. Unfortunately, there’s no word on pricing or a release date for the new model just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnk1ZMXiRA78RVVfeSAbir8VeDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228475/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_3.27.59_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X7PG44"&gt;Despite the 11th Gen moniker, though, the new Rocket Lake-S chips are still technically 14nm chips — they don’t use the 10nm process. However, they do feature Intel’s Cypress Cove cores, which bring improvements from the 10nm core designs back to the 14nm production process, allowing for faster speeds along with Intel’s faster Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPWTIT"&gt;According to Intel, the drop in core count compared to last year’s Core i9-10900K (which had 10 cores and 20 threads) is due to that move (the 10nm chips are currently only designed for up to eight cores right now), although it promises that the overall performance on the new 11th Gen model will still be better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCNqCM"&gt;There’s no official release date yet for the upcoming Rocket Lake-S chips, but Intel promises that they’ll be released in the first quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz2XYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:47pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details for Intel’s Cypress Cove cores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kevin Hart signs deal with Netflix for four exclusive movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 Winter TCA Tour - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44RSgIboZAYvxamONck_iMbrHTA=/0x34:2973x2016/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651981/1198527349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Sussman / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1vrj6"&gt;Netflix has signed &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/kevin-hart-along-with-hartbeat-productions-ink-exclusive-partnership-with"&gt;a multiyear deal with Kevin Hart&lt;/a&gt; and his production company HartBeat Productions for four exclusive films starring Hart and first dibs on films the comedy star develops with his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YT7Rh"&gt;Hart partnered with Netflix most recently for his comedy special &lt;em&gt;Zero F**ks Given,&lt;/em&gt; which Netflix says was the “#1 Netflix comedy special in 2020,” but this new deal would bring the lucrative comedy star even deeper into the fold. Hart’s films have grossed a combined $4 billion in the global box office, according to Netflix, so taking advantage of that star power to draw users to the streaming service and keep them around makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UboHUV"&gt;Relying on recognizable comedy stars has been a successful formula for Netflix. Adam Sandler’s deal with the company has produced films that consistently rank among the top of Netflix’s charts. Sandler’s films on Netflix have been so popular that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019"&gt;Netflix has renewed its deal with the former &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; star twice&lt;/a&gt; just to keep him around. Beyond that, Hart and Sandler share a similar broad appeal, generally enjoyed by all ages in the US and fans around the world. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21142065/netflix-streaming-wars-subscriber-growth-disney-international"&gt;Netflix expands globally&lt;/a&gt;, films with stars who are recognizable everywhere become more and more important to keep growing its subscriber base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQmbGd"&gt;Hart’s not without his controversies — most notably, a pattern of homophobic behavior (and tweets) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18131221/kevin-hart-oscar-hosting-homophobia-twitter-tweets"&gt;that cost him a gig hosting the Academy Awards in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The star has since &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/kevin-hart-oscar-controversy-looking-back"&gt;acknowledged his mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, but Hart’s past remarks could be a concern for some Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dickinson’s second season trades death for fame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiM1UN0z03sOspJS7L9gwFDnlBU=/126x0:1314x792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651910/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_3.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UK0uk6"&gt;Writing is often the domain of obsessives, and Emily Dickinson — at least, the witty, chaotic version of her portrayed by Hailee Steinfeld on Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; — gives herself over to her obsessions fully. In the first season of the show, which is an irreverent, &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the life of the famed young poet, her obsession was Death, played by Wiz Khalifa. (Like I said: irreverent.) In the latest season, Steinfeld’s Emily is obsessed with fame. Lovers of dramatic irony have a lot to dig into here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brnbxJ"&gt;The new season of &lt;em&gt;Dickinson &lt;/em&gt;is a lot like the first: equal parts over-the-top comedy and earnest teen soap. But this time around, the show has a touch more restraint. It keeps the outrageous excess — &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is still an anachronistic comedy whose teens behave as if they were in a modern CW soap, while its adults are all caricatures of 19th century historical figures — but it builds in a little more self-control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Deuqiw"&gt;In the show’s first season, the ethos of transgression for transgression’s sake resulted in some moments of poor taste; the show, which is about teens in white middle-class Amherst, would frequently drop hip-hop beats to underline how edgy they were, for example. The series often undermined its irreverence by calling too much attention to it, and if there’s one big improvement in what’s been shown of season 2 so far — the first three episodes of which are streaming now — it’s in that particular regard. In season 2, &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is content to merely be the show it is: which is, in fact, pretty great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy5nVe"&gt;In the second season’s premiere, &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; breaks the proverbial fourth wall and addresses the viewer directly, calling attention to the difference between the show and the actual history of Emily Dickinson’s life. It notes, curiously, that the story is moving into a portion of Emily’s life that is not as well-documented: the start of what would be a 30-year seclusion where the only thing scholars know she did for sure was write, and write &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Future episodes may or not make this clear, but this kind of prologue makes you wonder about the show’s intent. &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is a tongue-in-cheek retelling of history that’s already inventing a lot. What might noting the ambiguity of historical record signal? &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; departures from history? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qn3iQq"&gt;And so &lt;em&gt;Dickinson’&lt;/em&gt;s new season wrestles with what could have been. Emily is tempted to forgo her longstanding practice of writing only for herself and her friend and former paramour Sue — who’s now in a troubled marriage with Emily’s brother Austin — and she’s entertaining the thought of being published. Meanwhile, new players enter. Samuel Bowles (Finn Jones), the editor of the &lt;em&gt;Springfield Republican&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;might have an interest in publishing her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQiYTz"&gt;Returning characters have their storylines develop. Henry (Chinaza Uche), a Black man who does work for the Dickinsons, for example, is starting to secretly publish and organize Amherst’s Black community. This is all to say that the second season of &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt; is starting to make a more pronounced effort to be more than a progressive take on a white woman’s story, albeit one played by an actor of color. It seems to have ambitions to be a progressive and very funny take on the era as a whole, and that makes the world of the show even richer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMX9Jx"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;, Emily’s world is expanding, even as we know from history that tragedy looms. Soon, she will recede from the world; soon, the nation will split in two and erupt in open warfare; and soon, all of these young people will find their perceptions of their equally young nation challenged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2lPuP"&gt;It’s the sort of thing Emily would write a poem about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Yd24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdcGDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ouv9KO"&gt;Western Digital is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F2021-01-11-western-digital-delivers-unmatched-line-up-of-high-capacity-portable-ssds&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225044%2Fwestern-digital-portable-ssds-storage-4tb-price-announced#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;doubling the maximum storage size&lt;/a&gt; of several of its portable SSDs to 4TB. Previously, Western Digital’s SSD lineup maxed out at 2TB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtAgGE"&gt;The 4TB storage configuration will be available under Western Digital’s My Passport and WD_Black black brands, along with its subsidiary SanDisk’s Extreme series. All of the products will also include a five-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcCw24"&gt;Starting at $680, Western Digital’s My Passport SSD, which received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/20/21376091/western-digital-my-passport-ssd-portable-storage-backup-second-gen-faster"&gt;model refresh last August&lt;/a&gt;, promises up to 1050MB/s read speeds and 1000MB/s write speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THuwtQrJtr0xZn2WCZCYfKHYNvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227999/WD_Black_P50_TopOrtho_LightOn_3.jpg.thumb.840.840.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD is great for console gamers looking for an external device to store their games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n3cM1c"&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD 4TB configuration will retail for $750 and include read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. This external SSD is compatible with PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKoVKE"&gt;But buyer beware: if you are looking to buy this as an external SSD to supplement the storage on your PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, there are a few caveats. It can connect to the PS5, but you can only store PS4 games. And while it will work on the Xbox Series X / S, this game drive is not compatible with the next-gen console's SSD expansion output to take full advantage of the next-gen hardware. Currently, the one SSD that takes full advantage of the Series X / S’s hardware is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181854/microsoft-xbox-series-x-expansion-cards-removable-storage-support-features"&gt;Seagate’s Expansion Card&lt;/a&gt;, which only comes in 1TB. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the SanDisk Extreme and Extreme Pro received a model refresh last September.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4RD1x"&gt;The SanDisk Extreme’s 4TB configuration will cost $700 and promises transfer speeds of up to 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write. An even faster option, the 4TB Extreme Pro, will cost $900 and delivers both read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UKJ7a"&gt;Western Digital says all of these products are expected to launch “later this calendar quarter” on its website and the Western Digital website. &lt;/p&gt;
