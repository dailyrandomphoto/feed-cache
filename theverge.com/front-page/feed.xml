    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uGluK"&gt;Amazon’s annual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Prime Day sale is coming up real soon&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon is already offering discounts on some of its Echo speakers ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u4oFlX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Prime Day deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to its lowest price of $30. However, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $45, $5 off its regular price. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $55, also $5 less than its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;The best price is if you want two Dots, as you can get two for $50 with the offer code PDDOT2PK on Amazon. That’s effectively a buy-one-get-one price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evE64A"&gt;Amazon is also currently selling some bundles, including a free &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sengled Bluetooth lightbulb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now it’s currently available with the same $5 discount as the standard Dot &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a discounted bundle for $70, though, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth-gen Echo is available for $75 ($25 less than the usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, you can get two for $120 using the offer code ECHOPRIME. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the one to consider. The latest edition, which was released in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. It’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $84.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDeSDU"&gt;In wake of the news, Amazon has reduced the price of the last-gen Echo Show 5. The first-gen model used to retail for $90, but for a limited time, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available for the first-gen model; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $61, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $55, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $65. You can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08ZN869Z4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo%2Bshow%2B5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5 with the same security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $95, a $25 discount, or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B0914SZWST/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo%2Bshow%2B5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $105. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the first-gen &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551040779921713" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also preorder an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 will soon be available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently on sale for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $100, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The new second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen/-/A-83387876&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/this-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap removes speed filter linked to reckless driving lawsuits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d3itSU0vSfc_KF7AqXH8onyUX-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468531/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jZPfi8"&gt;Snap is removing its controversial “speed filter” from Snapchat this week, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007385955/snapchat-ends-speed-filter-that-critics-say-encouraged-reckless-driving"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The in-app effect displays your current speed in miles or kilometers per hour, and many critics have claimed the feature encouraged reckless driving — with some saying that Snap should be held liable when the speed filter was connected to deadly car crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ipxMH"&gt;There have been multiple lawsuits over the years connecting Snapchat to car crashes. One concerning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11526860/snapchat-mph-filter-speeding-car-accident-suit"&gt;a 2015 car accident in Georgia&lt;/a&gt; arrived just a few years after Snapchat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231580/snapchat-releases-big-new-update-with-visual-filters-new-captions-and"&gt;was first updated to include the filter&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since, the company has demoted the filter to a sticker, burying it in a separate menu, and making it a bit harder to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPx3Bh"&gt;The Ninth Circuit Appeals Court recently ruled that Snap could be sued for the speed filter / sticker’s involvement in car accidents. The court found that Snap isn’t protected here by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt; — a portion of the Communications Decency Act that shields companies from being sued over the content users’ publish on a platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrk9LD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420679/snapchat-speed-filter-wrongful-death-lemmon-snap-appeals-ruling-section-230"&gt;The case, &lt;em&gt;Lemmon v. Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, involved another crash in Georgia that resulted in the death of three men in 2017. The Ninth Circuit court said that the family members of the men could sue Snap after the case was initially dismissed in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNnkDV"&gt;Snap confirmed that the sticker is being removed and offered the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pS47cP"&gt;Nothing is more important than the safety of our Snapchat community, and we had previously disabled the filter at driving speeds. Today the sticker is barely used by Snapchatters, and in light of that, we are removing it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="it7Yjw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIwq8urp9JpLCnY1pX0PTUYSq4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468484/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUkRVV"&gt;Microsoft’s next-gen console may have arrived, but getting your hands on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exactly easy. Much like the PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s console remains in short supply due to increased demand and ongoing chip shortages, a problem that will likely extend into 2022. Thankfully, if you haven’t managed to secure either console, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=NextGenRestocks4152021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Series X is available at Walmart right now for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. (Walmart is releasing new waves of consoles every 10 minutes for now, so check again if you strike out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i7fA5"&gt;If you’re not sure how the Series X differs from the more affordable but weaker Series S console, there a few things to consider. First, unlike the Series S, the Series X features a 4K UHD Blu-ray drive, which allows it to play physical games and other media. The Series X also has a 1TB SSD instead of the 512GB SSD found on the Series S, and it renders games in native 4K at 60fps. The Series S targets it 1440p and features a slimmer build, but otherwise, the machines are essentially the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p6l6Py"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ykqbO"&gt;If you do manage to pick up either console, there are a few more accessories to consider if you want to make the most of your next-gen console. Although the highly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;was pushed&lt;/a&gt; to an undisclosed date in the fall, popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-XBOX-ONE/dp/B087XPDJ5M/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have received graphical updates designed to leverage Microsoft’s next-gen hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oTNqbi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WUNtXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10529051"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfc713"&gt;If you don’t mind playing older titles, we also suggest picking up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to more than 100 first- and third-party titles, an EA Play membership, discounts, and all the perks that come with Xbox Live Gold. A subscription to Game Pass Ultimate also grants you access to Xbox Game Studios titles the same day they’re released, meaning you’ll be able to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nvidia Shield’s Android TV interface is getting a Google TV-inspired revamp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnI0YOZhhaQ_KY5to0LXhKft6R0=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468463/shield_tv_discover_home_page.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featuring a new Discover tab, and a redesigned home screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbzLKe"&gt;Starting today, Nvidia’s Shield devices are getting a revamped user interface, similar to what we saw come to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263131/android-tv-software-update-ui-interface-menus-google-chromecast-refresh"&gt;other Android TV devices in February&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest change is a new Discover tab, which features content recommendations grouped by genre. The “All Apps” screen has also been tweaked: it’s now simply called “Apps” and uses a full-screen layout that Nvidia says shows more apps at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZEglO"&gt;The new design appears to have drawn inspiration from the Google TV software on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;last year’s Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not identical (Google TV has the recommendations-focused “For you” tab as its home screen, for example), but there are obvious similarities. Most notably, the large circular app icons on the left side of the display have disappeared, and Nvidia’s screenshot also shows a large promotion for Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;at the top of the Home screen, replacing the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJNNtzXOaX8O6_Z1p2MFksYex4A=/0x0:2040x1360/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324134/DSCF4417.jpg"&gt;blank space&lt;/a&gt; that was there before, which some (many?) might find annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCQ5zK"&gt;Signs of the redesign appeared back in April, when &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/shield-tv-homescreen-ads-android-tv-discover/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a screenshot of the new design briefly appeared in the Play Store listing for the Nvidia Games app. Nvidia says the update should start appearing today, with the rollout expected to take around a week in total. Customers in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, and Australia will get the new UI and Discover tab, while those in Italy and Spain will only get the new UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Inbuxs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdMdwT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Not just RavPower — Amazon has yanked Vava and TaoTronics, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6vKPa11043_-676-F_y_-cp-oc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468338/akrales_171024_2082_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4NML2c"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/cheap-consumer-devices-amazon.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profiled Sunvalley&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese electronics manufacturer that obsessively monitored Amazon to build and maintain US-facing brands with a reputation for quality. They include phone charging specialist RavPower, home office and dash cam supplier Vava, and headphones and home appliance purveyor TaoTronics. Now, all three of them have disappeared from Amazon, seemingly for ignoring the platform’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqNFle"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;Amazon confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it had removed RavPower. (Amazon tells us it’s checking on Sunvalley’s other brands). But it’s clear from their empty Amazon storefronts that something’s going on — and Sunvalley’s Chinese parent company has already issued a statement, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405535690188681224"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Ngyuen&lt;/a&gt;, confirming that Amazon suspended them on June 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ee6c4k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RAVPower's parent company has issued a statement saying that three of its brands (incl. Taotronics and VAVA) were suspended from Amz yesterday, affecting 31% of the company's revenue, and it will rely on its DTC site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stock is down 12% today.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/6hKeLiyvgm"&gt;https://t.co/6hKeLiyvgm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405535690188681224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4wxEtp"&gt;When Nguyen bought a new charger from RavPower, &lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb?amp=1"&gt;she received an offer&lt;/a&gt; for a $35 gift card in exchange for an Amazon review. That kind of manipulation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;has been against Amazon’s rules&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, and Sunvalley’s statement suggests that’s also the reason why these brands were suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFijCM"&gt;Still, there’s something weird about the situation. Sunvalley’s brands stood out among the throngs of fly-by-night electronics vendors on Amazon with their word-jumble names&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Also, the products were often good!&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;RavPower made our favorite wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;, and we recommended the Vava Laser TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21453070/best-projector-home-theater"&gt;as “the projector with the best image quality&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt; called a Vava hub &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-hubs-and-docks/"&gt;the best USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt;, and we recommended a HooToo USB-C hub &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iCSO9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HooToo, Anjou, and USpicy are still kicking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye7aLN"&gt;Interestingly, Amazon hasn’t yet removed HooToo, a fourth Sunvalley brand — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hootoo&amp;amp;i=electronics&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;it still has at least three USB-C hubs on sale&lt;/a&gt;. Another brand, USpicy, seems to still be selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/USpicy-Professional-Essential-Cosmetics-Foundation/dp/B00UJ0P4PM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a pack of makeup brushes&lt;/a&gt;, and aromatherapy brand Anjou &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1E8713AD-4E1A-48E4-A931-27FD1017FC11?ingress=0&amp;amp;visitId=8f895c56-e4cd-41eb-a460-7630697a5fb9"&gt;still has a line of essential oil diffusers&lt;/a&gt;, bath bombs, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHKXPm"&gt;Sunvalley said in the statement that the affected Amazon stores count for 31 percent of its revenue, which is a lot, but the impact may not stop there. Some of the company’s products have also been fulfilled by Amazon, even if you were to buy them at a website like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fravpower.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538779%2Famazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ravpower.com&lt;/a&gt;, for example. When I tried to purchase a RavPower charger yesterday, I received an email saying that my order couldn’t be completed. It’s possible that they just sold out, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozg5Q0"&gt;RavPower didn’t respond to a request for comment, and I spent about 10 minutes on hold with Sunvalley US before being told they’d get back to me sometime in the next two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBZv9Q"&gt;Something that may or may not be relevant: Allen Fung, Sunvalley US’s longtime general manager, who takes credit for building these brands and running the Amazon business over the past ten years, left the company in January 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-fung-8b7b725/"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt;. Sunvalley appears to &lt;a href="http://www.sh-abc.cn/en/index.php?ac=article&amp;amp;at=list&amp;amp;tid=55"&gt;have been acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; by Guangdong SACA Precision Manufacturing, a company &lt;a href="http://www.sh-abc.cn/en/index.php?ac=article&amp;amp;at=list&amp;amp;tid=54"&gt;primarily focused&lt;/a&gt; on producing hinges and slides for drawers and home appliances. That’s the company that issued the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90L80c"&gt;Amazon confirmed on Wednesday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;it suspended gadget brands Aukey and Mpow too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo will build its electric vehicles at a new Oklahoma factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MQK3M7M8arhmrCTC3yopeWlsyk=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468287/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior__24_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNe41H"&gt;California EV startup Canoo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/61/milestone-met-canoo-selects-oklahoma-for-owned"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that it plans to build its electric vehicles at a new factory to be built outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The startup claims the facility will create “more than 2,000 jobs” and that it will open in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2zmAk"&gt;The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant, according to Canoo, which is calling the facility a “mega microfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0tWlg"&gt;But since Canoo wants to put its first vehicle — an electric van first announced in 2019 — into production by the end of 2022, it will have the first units built by a contract manufacturer in the Netherlands called VDL Nedcar. Canoo says VDL Nedcar will build “up to 1,000 vehicles” for both the US and European markets in 2022 and is targeting 15,000 vehicles in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlMtiI"&gt;Canoo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;went public at the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt; and raised around $600 million in the process, also plans to build an electric delivery vehicle that is adaptable for other small business use cases, as well as an electric pickup truck. All three vehicles are built on the same compact platform, which houses the battery pack, the motors, and pretty much all of the electronics. While a number of automakers and suppliers are developing EV platforms, Canoo’s compact packaging drew interest from Hyundai and Apple — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;a deal with Hyundai is now dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;talks with Apple broke down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMIABt"&gt;Tony Aquila, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;took over as CEO of Canoo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement that the startup ran a “multi-state competition and invested millions of dollars to find the right manufacturing facility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4OG69w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pUazVU"&gt;Oklahoma — and the city of Tulsa, in particular — waged a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;massive, meme-filled campaign&lt;/a&gt; to try to convince Tesla to build its Cybertruck factory there in 2020, though it ultimately lost out to Austin, Texas. The state “literally threw everything on the table” to woo Tesla, including trying to match the $1.3 billion incentive package that the Silicon Valley automaker landed for its original Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rsyQM"&gt;While Oklahoma lost the fight for Tesla’s business, many of the people involved in that solicitation process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that they believed being in the running was worth it just to get on the radar of other automakers. On Thursday, officials from the state said that effort had paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5TEaq"&gt;“We have made electric vehicle manufacturing a top priority in our recruitment efforts as we work to further diversify Oklahoma’s economy,” Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Workforce Development Scott Mueller said in a statement. “Governor Stitt and I were able to work closely with Tony and his team over the last several months and showed the entire Canoo team the many merits of doing business in Oklahoma, including the value of the collaborative effort between great leaders like Tony and the senior leadership of our state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrWdXY"&gt;During an investor event in Texas on Thursday, Aquila said that the total incentive package is “over $300 million.” The state of Oklahoma may kick in “millions more” based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility. “It’s a pretty good deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JePyzC"&gt;The governor’s office confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Canoo will receive some funds through the state’s Quick Action Closing Fund incentive program, but did not specify an amount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juiced HyperScrambler 2 review: speed demon</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is it an e-bike or an e-moped? Who cares, it’s fast&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="o10qt9"&gt;The Juiced HyperScrambler 2 is a lot of bike for a surprisingly affordable price. The classic mini-bike-meets-moped design is very popular among e-bike companies right now, with dozens of smaller brands trying to cash in on the trend. But Juiced is one of the first to do it, and do it well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfSrV8"&gt;With the HyperScrambler 2, the SoCal company went all in on speed and power. The dual-battery setup ensures hours of riding without fear of getting stranded miles from home without any juice. (Sorry.) The only question is whether your butt can actually endure so many hours of riding in this particular saddle. (Mine could not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OBvfOs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Super73 v Juiced: Racing two extremely powerful e-bikes|102100" data-volume-uuid="9621959b1" data-volume-id="102100" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-767" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81o9ep"&gt;When I say this is a lot of bike, I’m not exaggerating. At a whopping 119 pounds, the HyperScrambler 2 is one of the heaviest e-bikes I’ve ever tested. That’s mostly thanks to those twin 52-volt / 19.2 amp-hour batteries strapped to the middle of the frame. That weight can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on what kind of riding style you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0X2dBF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10611829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8x2SZ"&gt;The HyperScrambler’s girth certainly gives it a more commanding stance on the pavement, which can help improve riding confidence. On the other hand, this is not a bike meant for carrying up and down stairs or even throwing in the back of a truck or SUV — at least not without the risk of a herniated disc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGJUB"&gt;But forget all of that for a moment: I have a lot of e-bikes in my garage right now, but every time I’ve had friends over in recent months, there was only one they wanted to try out for themselves. The Juiced HyperScrambler 2’s ostentatious design and powerful motor practically begs to be ridden — and ridden fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2mt8nWr0hNhSxybS5qwLg6oIJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665030/DSC_0035.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The large, round headlamp and elongated saddle give this bike its classic mini-bike feel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4YBdKP"&gt;Juiced is a Southern California company, as if that wasn’t obvious. Founded in 2009 by Tora Harris, a Princeton graduate and former Olympic high-jumper, the company originally was focused on importing lithium-Ion batteries before pivoting to e-bikes. A year later, Juiced launched its first bike, the low-step &lt;a href="http://juicedriders.squarespace.com/odk/"&gt;ODK utility bike&lt;/a&gt; (which kind of looked like a precursor to the RadRunner by Rad Power Bikes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw5kTQ"&gt;Juiced now sells 10 models under four distinct categories: the Rip-Current fat tire bikes; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20875870/juiced-scorpion-ebike-price-specs-release"&gt;moped-style Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;; the Scrambler minibikes; and Cross-Current for urban commuting. The company has earned consistent praise for its ultra-fast, moped-lite bikes. &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a33313406/best-fat-tire-ebikes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bicycling&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; named the HyperScorpion one of its best fat tire e-bikes of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QY4vOe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can confirm the “insane” range on this bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CW5Yux"&gt;The HyperScrambler 2 was unveiled in September 2020. (The original HyperScrambler, which came out in 2019, suffered from controller issues and wasn’t widely distributed.) &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/juiced-unveils-truly-insane-2kw-and-30-mph-hyperscrambler-2-electric-bike/"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Harris called the bike’s range “truly insane” and said the HyperScrambler 2 was the “perfect mobility solution for a broad range of riders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqGApa"&gt;I can confirm the “insane” range on this bike, but is it the perfect mobility solution? Not exactly. There’s no question that there’s a lot to like about this bike, but there are also some serious trade-offs that need to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/djvkF-97X86fQg3EQ2JacJ9WMEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664763/DSC00230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alix Diaconis&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The HyperScrambler 2 is extremely heavy, not exactly affordable, but very fun to ride. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aG0DpG"&gt;First, let’s talk about the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jUzaVW"&gt;Motor: Bafang RetroBlade rear hub (1,000W continuous power and 2,000W peak power)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2bLcsp"&gt;Top speed: 30-plus mph (48.2 km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Cpqk7M"&gt;Range: 33-100 miles (55-166 km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oQxKQo"&gt;Battery: Twin 52V 19.2Ah (998 Wh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MV7vEv"&gt;Weight: 119 lbs (53.9 kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNgUzl"&gt;Brakes: Tektro HD-E350 Hydraulic Disc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPPgZd"&gt;Tires: 20-inch Innova&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WymQkl"&gt;Headlamp: 2,000 lumen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6M7y6v"&gt;Extras: Front and rear suspension; sideview mirrors; USB charger; turn signals, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TCTX74"&gt;Price: $2,699&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xWpMlM"&gt;It may not be the most high-performance e-bike on the market — the Super73 RX proved to have a little more pick-me-up than the HyperScrambler 2 in a side-by-side test — but it provides more than its fair share of white-knuckled, dumb grin-producing experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z21PWn"&gt;Juiced offers five different versions of the HyperScrambler 2: three pedal-assist models and two throttle speed models. I tested the highest spec version, the throttle-based Race Track Mode with a top speed of 30-plus mph. With a twist of the throttle, the bike rocketed up to a top speed of 32mph — just fast enough to make my palms sweaty. The noise from the motor was tolerable, though it wasn’t nearly as silent as most of the Bosch-powered bikes I’ve ridden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8OAHFJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a twist of the throttle, the bike rocketed up to a top speed of 32mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PM7Jvu"&gt;I did experience some problems with the HyperScrambler’s throttle. Occasionally, the motor would stay engaged even without pedaling or using the throttle, which created some awkward moments. Squeezing the brake would turn it off, but releasing the brake would cause the bike’s motor to turn back on without twisting the throttle. These are the kinds of wiring problems that your local bike shop probably isn’t equipped to repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v0p3N"&gt;If I was thinking about buying this bike, I might be concerned about longtime service and repair issues. When things break down — and they inevitably will — it’s going to be more of a hassle to get these bikes fixed than your average 10-speed. Juiced has a &lt;a href="https://www.juicedbikes.com/pages/warranty"&gt;fairly extensive warranty&lt;/a&gt;, but it only applies to new bike purchases. If you buy the HyperScrambler used, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZodI7g"&gt;The two-foot-long (62-centimeter) padded seat is where the HyperScrambler gets most of its classic mini-bike looks, but I really wish Juiced had gone with something more adjustable and more comfortable. For short rides, the seat proved to be no problem; but for those longer trips, my butt was a little worse for wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lWPFd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Juiced claims you can get up to 100 miles of range on a single charge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2aOc"&gt;Juiced claims you can get up to 100 miles of range on a single charge, but that’s only riding in the lowest possible setting. In my experience, very few people will ride a bike this way. But with the dual-battery configuration, the HyperScrambler 2 has 1,989 watt-hours, which is just an incredible amount of battery capacity. Juiced has a balancer module that automatically draws power evenly from the two batteries. And you have the option to simply turn one battery off if you only want to drain one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HisNYj"&gt;The dual batteries really did wonders for my range anxiety. I test a lot of e-bikes, and I’ve been stuck miles from home with a dead battery more times than I can count. It’s not fun. But the HyperScrambler 2 is one of the longest-range bikes I’ve ever ridden. If you’re gunning it all the time at 30mph (and, real talk: you will be; it is so friggin’ fun), you are going to get about 20–25 miles per battery, so about 50 miles total. And riding in a more laid-back style will get you even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dYx02zv5CANUVjcO7yREm0EdgbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665033/DSC_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The dual batteries will do wonders for your range anxiety. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HFYggf"&gt;The components on the HyperScrambler 2 are really, well, very busy. In addition to the 8-gear shifter, there’s a USB plug, turn signals (!), an extremely loud (and annoying) horn, and an LCD display, where you can toggle between power settings. The sideview mirrors and turn signals were a nice touch and certainly improved my riding experience. They were also a good reminder that the HyperScrambler is really pushing the common definition of what many would consider an electric bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm3g7n"&gt;I think the main question you need to ask yourself before buying this bike is: what kind of riding do you plan on doing? If you’re looking for an e-bike that can replace a car, with some room for cargo or even a kid seat, this is not the bike for you. But if you’re looking for a bike that can go wicked fast, impress your friends with a uniquely classic design, and won’t break the bank (but may break your head — always wear a helmet!), then this should definitely fall under your consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="G1rVEg"&gt;This is a vibes bike, the kind you take out on a warm summer night when the sun is low over the horizon, you have some cash in your pocket, and the good taco truck is just down the street. It’s for boardwalk cruising, gravel grousing, and definitely anywhere there’s a flat stretch of pavement and no cars. Just twist that throttle, and let it rip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three big questions about Facebook’s new VR ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Advertisement within the Oculus Quest game Blaston." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LidtzYoDzFoXNYwZZ_eISywXrCY=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468003/image001.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HcvxhP"&gt;Yesterday, Facebook took a leap many people have been predicting for years: it started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;putting ads inside virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;. The company launched a limited test of advertisements inside three Oculus Quest apps, saying it would expand the system based on user feedback. The move is a turning point for Oculus, bringing one of Facebook’s most controversial features into a medium that inspires both idealism and alarm. And it raises three big questions about Facebook’s future and immersive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfQqaZ"&gt;The first question is how deeply Facebook will end up linking advertising with hardware sensor data. Even more than smartphones, Oculus Quest headsets are a &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/23/virtual-reality-allows-the-most-detailed-intimate-digital-surveillance-yet/"&gt;gold mine of information&lt;/a&gt; about you. They capture precise head and hand motion, pictures of your surroundings through tracking cameras, and microphone audio for Facebook’s voice command system. Future headsets will likely include even more intimate features like eye tracking, which would offer incredibly precise metrics on what captures your attention in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMTzRB"&gt;Right now, Facebook says much of this data either never leaves your headset or is completely segmented from its advertising system, and it says it has “no plans” to do things like target ads based on movement data. But as Facebook moves deeper into virtual and augmented reality, using its hardware’s special features for advertising will become an increasingly attractive prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eTL6um"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Immersive computing is a gold mine of intimate data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Myuua1"&gt;Facebook is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;working on a fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; and has discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418353/facebook-reality-labs-vr-ar-glasses-audio-experiment-perceptional-superpowers"&gt;building AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll use to interact with the world. These products are custom-built to produce quantifiable insights about your body and surroundings, and it’s hard to believe Facebook doesn’t have plans to monetize that — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22221251/facebook-reality-labs-boz-andrew-bosworth-interview-privacy-moderation-horizon-ar-vr"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth&lt;/a&gt; has said the company is “not really focused on business model” questions for experimental hardware. Oculus is Facebook’s first big test case for advertising on its own computing device, and as it expands ads on VR and other hardware, we’ll see how it handles the wealth of new data types it’s collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHoC1e"&gt;The second question is how ads will affect VR development. Several of the bestselling VR titles right now feel like substantive console or PC games and sell at a similar price. By contrast, it’s not yet clear which app genres work well with an ad-based model. (&lt;em&gt;Blaston&lt;/em&gt;, the first game we know includes ads, is a &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/blaston-impression-vr-dueling-bullet-hell/"&gt;multiplayer dueling game&lt;/a&gt; that you play in short competitive bouts.) Whatever those genres are, Facebook just created an incentive to make a lot more of them, since developers get a cut of the revenue involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BPnKF"&gt;It’s easy to imagine dystopian scenarios like a huge library of attention-grabbing but low-quality games and social apps plastered with pop-ups, or the seizure-inducing corporate hellscape &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpPE85Jogjw"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t help that Facebook’s first tests look like flat banner ads from a website or freeware game. That said, Facebook is notoriously picky about what goes into the Quest library and there’s no indication that will change soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZxyts"&gt;We also don’t know VR advertising’s final form. Facebook says it’s currently exploring “new ad formats that are unique to VR.” It didn’t specify what that looked like, but for one nontraditional ad platform, we could look at &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — a popular virtual world from a studio with an impeccable gaming pedigree, and one of the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/23/18635920/fortnite-jumpman-john-wick-marvel-brand-advertisement"&gt;most effective ad delivery systems&lt;/a&gt; in the modern cultural landscape. (A system where players pay to promote the intellectual property of multinational media conglomerates is possibly also dystopian, but in a way most people seem okay with.) Modern consumer VR headsets have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/14/11214484/mcdonalds-vr-htc-vive-sxsw-2016-capitalist-dystopia"&gt;full of ads&lt;/a&gt; since practically the beginning, thanks to promotional tie-ins and sponsorships. Yesterday’s news was just the latest iteration of a long-running trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PQ8Rox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does a good ad-supported VR app look like?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CR1WqU"&gt;This iteration, though, has a big Facebook-shaped wrinkle. The Quest ads are served based on data from your Facebook profile, and Facebook’s hyper-personalization is one of its most controversial features — criticized in general as a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/technology/campaigns-pressure-facebook-political-ads.html"&gt;tool for social division&lt;/a&gt; and more specifically for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403025/facebook-discriminatory-ads-housing-job-credit-hud"&gt;enabling discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond any larger social effects, if you’re sharing a headset with friends and family, it could feel simply invasive to have them see what Facebook thinks you’re into. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289577/facebook-rolling-out-multi-user-support-oculus-quest-2"&gt;add multiple accounts&lt;/a&gt; to a Quest headset, but the feature is experimental and it’s not clear how many users know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tReLQE"&gt;And that raises the third question: how will Facebook and its critics address general concerns about “Big Tech” in the realm of VR? Should Facebook, for example, ban specific kinds of ads — or methods of ad delivery — from appearing in headsets? And should consumer protection watchdogs look specifically at how ads work inside the Oculus platform, which they’ve largely ignored when scrutinizing Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aizaPY"&gt;It wasn’t hard to see these debates coming. Facebook has wanted to own the next computing platform for years, and its vision of computing relies a lot on advertising. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey once promised that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1405248117830602756"&gt;Oculus wouldn’t&lt;/a&gt; “flash ads at you” inside VR, but he (along with Oculus’ other early executives) left the company years ago. Bosworth &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/the-oculus-rift-will-be-ad-free-so-long-as-developers-want-it-that-way/"&gt;said in 2015&lt;/a&gt; that the Oculus experience “should include ads, because life includes ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXEPOy"&gt;But Facebook says it’s not just barreling ahead with a long-held master plan — instead, it promises it’s looking at feedback as it moves forward with VR advertising. As VR gets closer to Facebook’s core business, Quest users and developers will get to see if the company keeps that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab returns for Xbox Series X custom controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06FGi3cDUdKmmV4vE64ZHCVeVA4=/156x0:1277x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467839/xboxdesignlab.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LzpRjC"&gt;Microsoft is bringing its Xbox Design Lab back for Xbox Series X controllers. Originally launched in 2016, Xbox Design Lab allows Xbox owners to create personalized Xbox controllers. Microsoft is bringing the program back for the next-gen Xbox Series X controllers, after putting it on hold just ahead of the Series X launch last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiBeAC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Custom controllers will be available&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, and most European countries today, priced at $69.99 with millions of color combinations. Just like before, you can customize colors in pretty much every part of the controller, including bumpers, thumb sticks, the D-pad, and options for buttons. Engraving is also available for an extra $9.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU9rEq"&gt;All new Xbox Design Lab controllers will be based on the Xbox Series X / S controllers, which have fairly minor tweaks over the original Xbox One controller. Microsoft has reshaped its latest controllers to fit a “wider range of people,” and the latest Xbox controller also includes a redesigned D-pad and a dedicated share button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBmOuP"&gt;Unfortunately, you still can’t create a custom Xbox Elite controller. Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available today here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the 2021 fire season in the West</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COCHISE STRONGHOLD, ARIZONA - APRIL 18: A recent forest fire burned out a campground, April 18, 2021, in the Dragoon Mountains of Eastern Arizona.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk7cnJvGrhWWu7oufi_coSQ_Q7U=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467755/1316479844.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The stage is set for a bad season, but there are still a lot of unknowns&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iMhCtD"&gt;After a horrific 2020 fire season, the 2021 season is heating up. Ominous signs popped up early this year: a worsening drought and early heatwaves. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with fire, weather, and climate experts to break down what to expect throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocAsQ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How bad is 2021’s fire season going to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lumn6B"&gt;The stage is already set for a pretty bad fire season. Up to 9.5 million acres could burn this year, according to a fire season &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/accuweather-2021-us-wildfire-season-forecast/939026"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; from AccuWeather. That’s 140 percent of the 10-year average. It’s not as much as last year, when more than 10 million acres were scorched. That was the second worst year for fires in the US, in terms of acres burned, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf"&gt;since 1960&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVl8OE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUqbv"&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West at some point this year, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. A “significant fire” is one that grows so large that locals usually need to call in help from outside the region, according to Nick Nauslar, a fire meteorologist at the Bureau of Land Management. The blaze might span thousands of acres and require hundreds or thousands of personnel to battle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA6HY9"&gt;But predicting just how bad things will get is still a tough question, so it’s best to break it down into two parts that could influence how this fire season unfolds: known risk factors and wildcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grp25T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so what are the risk factors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tqr2CX"&gt;A major risk factor is drought. The Western US is in the middle of the most widespread and intense drought in decades. More than &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;83 percent of the West is in a drought&lt;/a&gt;; about half is experiencing “extreme” or “exceptional drought.” In fact, the water level at the Hoover Dam reservoir, the largest in the US, hit a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYxAVD"&gt;“This is currently the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US,” says Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. “When we see droughts like this, it really amplifies the fire season.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-ENVIRONMENT-DROUGHT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/byP8ub4kys1FdVTC7i7LPcTSNeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665088/1233384349.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Bridget Bennett / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A growing pale high-water mark known as a “bathtub ring” is seen on the shoreline of Lake Mead at the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 10th, 2021, where the water level has fallen to its lowest since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LbpCpG"&gt;Plants are parched, making them excellent fuel for wildfires. Spring was so hot and dry in California that San Jose State University researchers were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FireWeatherLab/status/1378184587315085313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1378184587315085313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F04%2F15%2Fweather%2Fcalifornia-wildfire-season-forecast%2Findex.html"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; in April to find no new growth of the Chamise plant, which they track to monitor moisture content in vegetation. Now, the plants are drying out faster than they normally do, with their moisture content just shy of reaching a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXKQOq"&gt;The lower the moisture content, the easier it is for vegetation to catch fire. In that situation, “If somebody drops a match or cigarette, you know, we’re hosed,” says Craig Clements, a professor and director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San Jose State University. Moisture content is closely tied to a fire’s spread rate, or how fast the blaze moves forward. So when that fuel is critically dry, Clements says, fires can get much bigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2A3VHZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the wildcards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqIj6a"&gt;The biggest wildcard is the weather. As of June 1st, there had been fewer acres burned this year than the 10-year average. That’s mostly because there hadn’t been “critical fire weather patterns,” which can be different combinations of high temperatures, strong winds, aridity, and lightning. In 2020, California got an unusual combination of lots of lightning with little rain. That sparked some of the state’s worst blazes, which were fanned by strong gales. California wound up doubling its record for acres burned that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ewj5z7QEP7Gldv_NyBQa9GTO-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867291/PANO0003-3.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearby wildfires blanketed San Francisco with smoke and turned skies orange during the 2020 fire season. Verge video director Vjeran Pavic took these pictures of San Francisco and Sutro Tower using a drone on September 9th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFtNSm"&gt;“If we transported us back to early to mid-June 2020, we probably have more potential this year than we did last year,” says Nauslar. “The potential is there, but now it’s a matter of if the weather will line up to realize that potential or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9edXHk"&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors. Do they take extra precautions? Or might they plan an elaborate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html"&gt;baby gender reveal that sparks a blaze&lt;/a&gt;? “As a resident in a high fire hazard area myself, and as someone who understands how quickly these fires can grow and put people in harm’s way, I definitely look at this upcoming season and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to be vigilant,” says Crystal Kolden, a former firefighter who is now an assistant professor of fire science at the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced. “We just have to keep reminding people that if there aren’t any human ignitions, then we don’t have any really big fires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7iWXdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u83uWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’s fire season going so far? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eSuswY"&gt;A scorching heatwave and high winds this week have fed what’s become the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/558859-one-of-arizonas-largest-wildfires-in-history"&gt;sixth-largest &lt;/a&gt;fire in Arizona’s history. Officials listed the cause of the Telegraph Fire burning outside of Phoenix as “&lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7512/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;,” but the cause is still under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xaqw4G"&gt;Most Western states have already had at least one significant fire this year, according to AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter. “So the season has run ahead of usual, if you will, in that regard,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TcTCr"&gt;Bad weather is starting to make things worse. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;temperature records fell&lt;/a&gt; this week during a sweltering spring heatwave. Salt Lake City, Utah, reached a record &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSaltLakeCity/status/1404949205588742146"&gt;107 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit on June 15th. The temperature in Billings, Montana, climbed up to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBillings/status/1405040165760868352"&gt;108 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit that day, tying its record. And Texas residents face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;power shortages&lt;/a&gt; as they sweat out the heatwave, just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456856/deaths-undercount-texas-freeze-power-outage"&gt;deadly blackouts&lt;/a&gt; during a freak cold snap earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nNIchI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does fire season last? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DmkXSh"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445539/2021-atlantic-hurricane-season-noaa-forecast"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, the fire season in the Western US doesn’t start and end on the same day every year. Unofficially, it’s been thought of as beginning in late spring and lasting through early fall, roughly May to November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz11WZ"&gt;The season hits its peak at different times in different regions. The Southwest typically sees peak fire potential earlier in the season, and then areas further north and west follow. Part of that has to do with what type of vegetation, or fuel, is in each region. Grass tends to dry out faster and then burn earlier. California’s shrubby chaparral takes a little longer to dry out and forests even longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4N735e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10611720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzsoBq"&gt;Fire season is growing longer, &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2315/study-fire-seasons-getting-longer-more-frequent/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows, thanks to changing rainfall and snowmelt patterns. Fire season has lengthened by 75 agonizing days across the Sierras, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqHr5G"&gt;“[Fire season] used to kind of have a better definition,” Nauslar says. “But now I think we’ve been more talking about ‘fire year.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xHTAjw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1weCgl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is climate change playing a role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBC6p1"&gt;The “season” is expected to keep growing longer and more intense as the planet heats up.  That’s because climate change is exacerbating many of the risk factors that drive wildfires. Heatwaves are getting more frequent and intense. Typical droughts are becoming megadroughts. Lightning strikes &lt;a href="https://environmentjournal.online/articles/the-future-is-not-forecast-how-lightning-is-affected-by-climate-change/"&gt;could even become more common&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/6/"&gt;By 2060&lt;/a&gt;, the amount of land lit up by lightning-ignited fires could be 130 percent of what it was in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JQUuo3"&gt;“Part of me looks at the upcoming season and says, you know, climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us, every single year,” Kolden says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzAXKi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9X1WU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
