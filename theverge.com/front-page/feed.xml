    <title>CD Projekt Red delays next-gen Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_61RFRc_EhvxrJg13czKDwfdi8=/105x0:1725x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020999/Cyberpunk2077_Always_bring_a_gun_to_a_knife_fight_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsXvdd"&gt;In September, CD Projekt Red said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22649551/cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-next-gen-ps5-xbox-series-upgrade-update-release-announcement"&gt;targeting late 2021 release dates&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s&lt;/em&gt; next-gen upgrades, but on Wednesday, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1450845753996455944"&gt;announced those won’t be hitting this year&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the plan is for the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to release in the first quarter of 2022, while the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for a release in the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZMdxmZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT PRODUCTION UPDATE &lt;a href="https://t.co/KOnaIVOt4v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KOnaIVOt4v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1450845753996455944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jnlnfX"&gt;With the delays, it seems like CD Projekt Red is taking steps to ensure it doesn’t repeat the botched launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;riddled with bugs and issues&lt;/a&gt; when it was first released in December of 2020. The studio has spent the months since releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627096/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-3-reset-perks-mini-map"&gt;numerous patches&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268382/cyberpunk-2077-1-12-new-hotfix-patch-mods-vulnerability-security"&gt;and hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address some of the problems. I haven’t spent much time with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; since I finished it earlier this year, but I’m looking forward to exploring Night City again once the next-gen upgrade arrives in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is officially bringing God of War to PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Q-uHKJoqQEtyRtqdPy4Xqmiifc=/108x0:3348x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020903/51607419349_561abb90d9_o.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQqiHp"&gt;One of Sony’s best PlayStation games, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, is headed to PC. The game will be available on January 14th, 2022, and you can preorder it now on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/god-of-war"&gt;Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; for $49.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqcFiL"&gt;If you opt to pick up the game on PC, you’ll be able to play it at 4K and unlocked frame rates, as well as in a 21:9 ultra widescreen aspect ratio (assuming you have the right hardware to support those features). The game will also support Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and its Reflex low-latency technology for “a more responsive experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nd4tgIp9Gj40J1PHXPZgFvXTieI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942003/51607636855_a89b1c912f_o.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;God of War&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xdgANL"&gt;Sony promises that the game will have “robust controller support and keyboard mapping customization,” and you can of course use Sony’s DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers if you prefer. You can read more about the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/20/god-of-war-2018-is-coming-to-pc/"&gt;upcoming PC port on Sony’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qgXc"&gt;Sony has slowly been bringing some of its biggest PlayStation hits to PC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312588/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-august-7-features-sony"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And in addition to &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, Sony is also planning to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which remasters both &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: The Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, though that currently has an unspecific early 2022 release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The mission to break barriers to space travel for people with disabilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsuSrSNywDbNEHMexVipRWtiEYM=/0x0:5500x3667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020835/20211017_LBC_ZG574_AstroAccess_610.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azubuike “Zuby” Onwuta flashes “Hook ‘em Horns” for the camera aboard the Zero G flight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mission: AstroAccess&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qk8zKK"&gt;When Sina Bahram shifted into weightlessness for the first time on Sunday, he could feel the air brushing past his skin as his body began to float into the air. As someone who’d longed to be an astronaut since he was four years old, he’d been waiting many years to have this exact feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbtoV5"&gt;“I knew it would be a joyous experience just because I looked forward to it for many decades of my life, but the visceral nature of that joy wasn’t brought home until you actually experience it,” &lt;a href="https://www.sinabahram.com/"&gt;Bahram&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist who runs Prime Access Consulting, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is truly indescribable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQEgEc"&gt;Bahram got to perceive free fall for the first time onboard a specially outfitted plane operated by the Zero-G Corporation, a company that provides parabolic flights that mimic the feeling of being weightless in space. He experienced the moment using his senses of touch, sound, smell, and taste — but not sight. Bahram has been legally blind for most of his life, something that effectively bars him from flying to space with NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wpQTiC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew it would be a joyous experience just because I looked forward to it for many decades of my life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AJcTi"&gt;But now, having experienced weightlessness himself, he’s more confident than ever that his disability should not be a barrier to space travel. “Even when you’re feeling completely out of control because everything you know about the world from your entire lifespan is no longer true, in terms of gravity — down being down; up being up — even with all of those removed, there was never a sense of uncertainty or danger,” says Bahram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmgoqF"&gt;Bahram was one of 12 people with a disability to experience weightlessness on Sunday, October 17th, during a parabolic flight, which took off from Long Beach, California. It was the first flight of its kind, &lt;a href="https://astroaccess.org/"&gt;arranged by a non-profit called Mission: AstroAccess&lt;/a&gt;, which has the stated goal of flying one or more of these flyers — called ambassadors — to space in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gsrPG3VsQR5y4NQVRmH5Mt_36Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941854/Headshot_SinaBahram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sina Bahram, one of the 12 ambassadors on the Mission: AstroAccess flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGANrs"&gt;It’s a goal that would certainly &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-to-rethink-whos-best-suited-for-space-travel/"&gt;shake up the current model for who is allowed to fly to space&lt;/a&gt;. To become a NASA astronaut, for instance, a candidate must be in excellent health and has to undergo a stringent physical to be considered for the program. NASA astronauts used to need 20/20 vision, though the space agency now allows individuals who wear glasses or who have had surgical procedures to correct their vision to 20/20. But NASA will not consider individuals who are blind, and any other major medical disabilities related to deafness or mobility will automatically disqualify someone from the application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJMJRW"&gt;However, human spaceflight is in the midst of a major transformation. For one thing, it’s not just NASA’s game anymore. Numerous private companies have sprung up in the last few decades aiming to send humans to various parts of space. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin have both developed suborbital vehicles that are designed to take paying customers to the edge of space and back so that flyers can experience a brief glimpse of Earth from above. Meanwhile, SpaceX has started flying people to low Earth orbit on its new Crew Dragon spacecraft. While the company built the vehicle primarily to carry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX recently flew a crew of four civilians to orbit&lt;/a&gt; on the vehicle during a private three-day mission. One of those passengers, Hayley Arceneaux, had an internal prosthesis in her leg — something that would have disqualified her from flying as a NASA astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="F8dJNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;human spaceflight is in the midst of a major transformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fVxBsv"&gt;Recently, the European Space Agency announced plans to select an astronaut with a physical disability &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Careers_at_ESA/ESA_Astronaut_Selection/Parastronaut_feasibility_project"&gt;through its Parastronaut Feasibility Project&lt;/a&gt;. With more opportunities than ever for non-NASA astronauts to fly to space, Mission: AstroAccess is striving for people with disabilities to be included in future missions — suborbital or orbital. Ultimately, AstroAccess wants to know how the physical space inside a spacecraft might be updated so that people with sight, sound, and mobility disabilities might be able to work and thrive in a space environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QWNyDxt3-izeNFngkA0Iqquf54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941904/AstroAccess_Flight1_Ambassadors_Tarmac.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mission: AstroAccess&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12 ambassadors ahead of their flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WrH4uX"&gt;Before that happens, though, AstroAccess wanted to give people with disabilities the opportunity to simply experience weightlessness. A crew of 12 were selected from a pool of applicants from all over the world to fly aboard the Zero-G Corporation’s Boeing 727. The belly of the plane is mostly gutted and padded to provide plenty of room to float around as the pilot steers the vehicle on a series of peaks and valleys to simulate weightlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYY1NN"&gt;Once the crew had been selected, they were grouped into teams. One group, which included Bahram, had people with varying degrees of limited vision. Another group had astronauts with varying levels of deafness. And a third group had those with limited mobility — people who either use prostheses or wheelchairs to move. Together the teams came up with different types of research and experiments they wanted to conduct during the flight. Bahram and his group decided to bring Braile displays to see how they fared in weightlessness, as well as tactile sensors to help determine the direction and orientation of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTXReG"&gt;Not all of their experiments panned out, Azubuike “Zuby” Onwuta, who is also legally blind, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“We brought on certain tools to help us conduct sound experiments, but then the roar of the engine drowned those tools that emitted sound,” said Onwuta, a US Army veteran and disability advocate who trained at Harvard-MIT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRYcw5"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://viktoriamodesta.com/"&gt;Viktoria Modesta&lt;/a&gt;, one of her biggest tasks ahead of the flight was coming up with the designs for the flight suits, which had to be tailored very specifically for each individual. Opting for black material with plenty of zippers and pockets, Modesta made sure each suit was crafted very specifically with each wearer in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YLu5wHNORaaz02EakNQ3pISq9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941778/AstroAccess_Flight1_ViktoriaModesta.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mission: AstroAccess&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viktoria Modesta experiencing weightlessness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dfd4ZU"&gt;“A lot of customization was done to people’s flight suits, specifically with openings, pockets, extra straps, and different ways of helping their body function in zero gravity,” Modesta, a singer and performance artist who had her left leg amputated below the knee years after an accident at birth, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Having such highly tailored suits became critical for some of the mobility crew to have the best possible experience. For instance, one of the ambassadors had a suit with special straps that held his legs together, which made it easier to focus on maneuvering through the space. And when some of the mobility crew found themselves floating, it was the first time in years that they could move around without the use of their chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Hndwt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it is our environments that are disabling, not individuals that are disabled”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="19lE2s"&gt;Each experience was different for each ambassador, and now Mission: AstroAccess has plenty of new data to help suggest what kind of accessibility-related changes should be incorporated in future spacecraft. That might include directional fabrics on the walls, for instance, to help those with limited vision determine their orientation. Bahram argues that making these kinds of updates is not just about being inclusive but also about making flights safer for every astronaut. He cited one instance in which astronaut Chris Hadfield went temporarily blind during a spacewalk when cleaning solution squirted into his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB1mZa"&gt;“That is a failure of the system,” Bahram says. “There is no reason whatsoever that that should have been as dangerous as it was. It was because NASA has not considered persons with disabilities as viable candidates. That could have been a complete non-issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6Dry7"&gt;With more accessible tools, all astronauts — from the able-bodied ones to those with disabilities — might have more options to remain safe during an emergency scenario. And it starts with designing a space with all types of bodies in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dajcgj"&gt;“It’s one of these things where this level of ableism has been built into our society, and we need to understand that it is our environments that are disabling, not individuals that are disabled,” Bahram says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists took the first steps toward pig-to-human kidney transplants </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="British Pig Farmers Ask Government To Ease Immigration Rules" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVlA_7ePYSsFG3IhvPFfW_zziug=/64x0:3973x2606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020647/1346397234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SO01c"&gt;For the first time, surgeons successfully attached a kidney from a genetically modified pig to a human patient — a major scientific breakthrough, and one that could open up a new way to provide organs to sick people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBQ2Lp"&gt;Scientists got the kidney from a pig genetically engineered so that it wouldn’t produce a sugar called alpha-gal, which the human immune system attacks and would trigger the body to reject the organ. Surgeons at NYU attached the organ to a brain-dead patient on a ventilator whose family agreed to the experimental procedure. It was connected outside of her body to blood vessels on her leg, and observed over a period of 54 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDxrVJ"&gt;The recipient’s body didn’t immediately reject the kidney, and the kidney functioned normally for the hours it was attached. “There didn’t seem to be any kind of incompatibility between the pig kidney and the human that would make it not work,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/kidney-transplant-pig-human.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;Robert Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; the director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;“There wasn’t immediate rejection of the kidney.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RLquT"&gt;There are still many open questions: it’s not clear if the organ would last over an extended period of time inside the body. While the kidney worked for the time it was attached, organ rejection can happen &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000815.htm"&gt;over years&lt;/a&gt; — and can happen even if the donor and the recipient are perfect matches. The details of the procedure haven’t been reviewed or published in a medical journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JtQoS"&gt;Experts are also considering the ethical implications of this type of animal-to-human procedure. Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047560631/in-a-major-scientific-advance-a-pig-kidney-is-successfully-transplanted-into-a-h"&gt;has a grant&lt;/a&gt; to develop ethics and policy recommendations for clinical trials of these transplants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpxwfp"&gt;But the procedure was still a landmark step &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9529493/pig-transplant-gene-editing"&gt;in efforts&lt;/a&gt; to perform animal-to-human transplants, called xenotransplantation. Animal heart valves have been used in human procedures &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174391911500374X"&gt;for decades&lt;/a&gt;, but those can be chemically treated to kill living cells and prevent rejections. Organs, made of living tissue, are more complicated. Proponents of the efforts envision a steady supply of organs from animals, which could help the thousands of people on waitlists for transplants. They could be a lifeline for the hundreds of thousands of people with kidney failure who rely on dialysis.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tOIHf"&gt;The kidney used in this procedure was produced by the company Revivicor. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its genetically altered pigs for therapeutic uses and for human consumption &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. (Some people have an allergy to the alpha-gal sugar, and meat from these pigs might be safe for them to eat.) The FDA would still need to review any medical products — like organs — before they could be used in medicine. The company &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00885-9"&gt;said in April&lt;/a&gt; that it hoped to launch clinical trials using its animal organs for transplants “within the next year or two.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook fined $70 million for withholding information about Giphy acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfxhRU2EAxJQRt4bX-jrDooRqc4=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020645/1345139017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="taAaCI"&gt;A UK watchdog has fined Facebook £50 million ($70 million USD) for purposely concealing information about its Giphy acquisition (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook began its $400 million acquisition of Giphy&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21260653/facebook-giphy-acquisition-merger-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar-josh-hawley-senate-antitrust"&gt;even members of Congress thought it was a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k40p4y"&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator"&gt;dealings with the massive GIF-making hub were called out by UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; in August, leading the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to launch an antitrust probe. As part of the investigation, the CMA issued an initial enforcement order (IEO) that prohibits any further integration between Facebook and Giphy, which is supposed to allow the companies to continue competing as if there was no acquisition at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rqmEhA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No decision has yet been reached in relation to the merger”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCKEmx"&gt;But according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach"&gt;press release from the CMA&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook failed to provide the required updates about its compliance with the IEO, despite receiving several warnings. The CMA says that Facebook breached the IEO by “consciously refusing to report all the required information,” resulting in a $70 million fine. This is in addition to another £500,000 ($700,000) fine that Facebook incurred by swapping its Chief Compliance Officer twice without asking permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsyFtK"&gt;The CMA says that this is the first time it has ever fined a company for such a deliberate violation. “This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law,” says Joel Bamford, the CMA’s senior director of mergers. In the press release, the CMA also notes that its investigation is still ongoing and that “no decision has yet been reached in relation to the merger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdZVIh"&gt;Facebook’s shady behavior, both in the past and present, has given Facebook quite a bit of bad publicity. That’s probably why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to rename the company and vanish into the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI is making a cinema camera with a built-in gimbal and LIDAR focusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjlRVLVKDZL-WPqHSTHPwdC_1Iw=/0x65:2048x1430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020639/Ronin_4D___Leica_M_mount__diagonal_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9O4ga6"&gt;Drone-maker DJI &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fronin-4d&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced a cinema camera&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a built-in gimbal, can shoot at up to 8K resolution, and uses a LIDAR rangefinder that promises a “sharper, faster, and more reliable focusing experience,” even in low light. It’s called the Ronin 4D, and while it’s aimed squarely at professionals, it’s loaded with interesting features and shows that DJI is continuing to develop its camera tech outside of drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmlC1Z"&gt;The Ronin 4D’s camera is called the Zenmuse X9, and it’s full-frame, has interchangeable lens mounts for DJI’s DL and Leica’s M systems, and includes nine (nine!) built-in ND filters for controlling your exposure in the sun. The 6K model can do 6K at 60fps and 4K120, and the 8K model can do 75fps at its max resolution. The X9 can shoot in RAW or 422HQ flavors of ProRes, or H.264 if you’re trying to keep file sizes in check, or need a fast turnaround for your footage. Until this point, DJI’s Zenmuse cameras have mostly been designed to fly on its drones, but (unfortunately for drone enthusiasts) the company tells me that the X9 is meant specifically for the Ronin 4D. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQrFDgwE2fXZbZxCCs51MRLnpZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940784/lVWoMnSA.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seems like a pretty cohesive unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsO6XV"&gt;DJI says that the 6K version of the Ronin 4D will be available in December and that the 8K version will be available “at a later date.” There’s also a ton of accessories coming for it, including a wireless monitoring system (which will also allow for remote control of the camera’s settings and gimbal movements, making the camera operator’s job easier) and a focus motor that will even let you adapt manual-focus lenses to use the LIDAR system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BjYmr16GJI7bYmu8ftu2Nnv5d1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940748/O6jdqnIw.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please enjoy this incredible demo image DJI provided. I’m sure the camera operator on the wire appreciates the remote camera controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLVFqKOSkqRWWrXCnPYCGfi-V1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940753/V0cgCwow.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LIDAR focus system, which has a 10-meter range and can control autofocus or provide a waveform to help with manual focusing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1IoIO"&gt;As for the built-in gimbal, DJI says it’ll be able to stabilize along four axes (hence the 4D in the name), including up and down. According to the company, this should help further reduce bumps or camera shake from an operator walking or running, which would be impressive — you can get that done with other stabilization tech, but it requires a good deal of skill, as basically any of my Steadicam footage will attest to. DJI says the Ronin 4D is “lighter and smaller than most cinema cameras mounted on a professional three-axis stabilizer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2vaHh"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18290251/dji-osmo-pocket-price-release-date-features-video-camera-photos"&gt;DJI’s Osmo camera / gimbal systems&lt;/a&gt;, or even some of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fronin-sc%3Fsite%3Dbrandsite%26from%3Dnav&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower-end Ronin gimbals&lt;/a&gt;, the Ronin 4D isn’t aimed at consumers or prosumers. The 6K version costs $7,199, the 8K version is $11,499, and both come with a decent kit: the gimbal, camera, LIDAR range finder, a monitor and hand grips / top handle, a carrying case, and a battery (the 8K camera also comes with a 1TB SSD). In the realm of production cameras and stabilization systems, that’s actually on the lower end (DJI’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1333927-REG%2Fdji_ronin_2_3_axis_stabilizer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cinema-focused Ronin 2 stabilizer&lt;/a&gt; costs over $8,000 without any camera attached, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1506002-REG%2Fsony_pxw_fx9v_pxw_fx9_xdcam_6k_full_frame.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s FX9 6K camera&lt;/a&gt; costs $11,000 for just the body), but if you were hoping to use the LIDAR focus system to absolutely nail focus in your vlogs, you may want to rethink that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eo6AeApgg0O8CfQrn0Y2Uj-OLSw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940765/auLYKoow.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: what shooting with the Ronin 4D looks like under more normal conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzEjOZ"&gt;Despite the professional focus, the Ronin 4D still looks like a really desirable piece of tech. It also makes sense coming from DJI — the company has obviously been putting a lot of work into its drone cameras and gimbal systems, so it was only a matter of time before it put them together. Plus, it’s always possible that a version of the LIDAR system will make its way to DJI’s handheld Osmo cameras, which could make for a very interesting vlogging setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r80Z32"&gt;As for DJI’s hopes of the Ronin 4D being a cinema camera, it’ll be interesting to see what kind of productions pick it up. It definitely seems like it’ll be worth considering for anyone shooting fast-paced footage, like documentary or commercial filmmakers. Whether Hollywood is looking for an all-in-one camera and gimbal versus a piecemeal system that gets you more control is hard to say — though DJI is working on getting &lt;a href="https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000579527-Cameras-and-Image-Capture"&gt;Netflix classification&lt;/a&gt;, so the Ronin 4D should be an option for anyone looking to shoot an original for the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AI oracle of Delphi uses the wisdom of Reddit to offer dubious moral advice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tljvXL8Ivv1IL0i7FJvfSt4lJrA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020568/acastro_181017_1777_brain_ai_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ke7EAC"&gt;Got a moral quandary you don’t know how to solve? Fancy making it worse? Why not turn to the wisdom of artificial intelligence, aka &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/"&gt;Ask Delphi&lt;/a&gt;: an intriguing research project from the Allen Institute for AI that offers answers to ethical dilemmas while demonstrating in wonderfully clear terms why we shouldn’t trust software with questions of morality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i60ZmD"&gt;Ask Delphi was launched on October 14th, along with a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07574.pdf"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; describing how it was made. From a user’s point of view, though, the system is beguilingly simple to use. Just &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/"&gt;head to the website&lt;/a&gt;, outline pretty much any situation you can think of, and Delphi will come up with a moral judgement. “It’s bad,” or “it’s acceptable,” or “it’s good,” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52FKng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each answer from the AI oracle includes a button to “share this on Twitter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pGPo8W"&gt;Since Ask Delphi launched, its nuggets of wisdom have gone viral in &lt;a href="https://stealthoptional.com/news/what-does-delphi-ai-think-of-star-treks-biggest-ethical-dilemmas/"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/ai-delphie-video-game-biggest-choices"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ask%20delphi&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. This is certainly as its creators intended: each answer is provided with a quick link to “share this on Twitter,” an innovation unavailable to the ancient Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WtpeR"&gt;It’s not hard to see why the program has become popular. We already have a tendency to frame AI systems in mystical terms — as unknowable entities that tap into higher forms of knowledge — and the presentation of Ask Delphi as a literal oracle encourages such an interpretation. From a more mechanical perspective, the system also offers all the addictive certainty of a Magic 8-Ball. You can pose any question you like and be sure to receive an answer, wrapped in the authority of the algorithm rather than the soothsayer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iPRXl-5TluucBVlFuoUrtSgpFfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938776/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_3.48.27_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fEXObQM4KAVjf-txUP8o6HIhBGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938778/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_3.48.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2FGLk"&gt;Ask Delphi isn’t impeachable, though: it’s attracting attention mostly because of its many moral missteps and odd judgements. It has clear biases, telling you that America is “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=america"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt;” and that Somalia is “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=somalia%0A"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;”; and it’s amenable to special pleading, noting that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sosowski/status/1449346385095102466"&gt;eating babies is “okay”&lt;/a&gt; as long as you are “really, really hungry.” Worryingly, it approves straightforwardly racist and homophobic statements, saying it’s “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=secure+the+existence+of+our+people+and+a+future+for+white+children"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt;” to “secure the existence of our people and a future for white children” (a white supremacist slogan known as the &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/14-words"&gt;14 words&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/williamlegate/status/1450136481574621189"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; “being straight is more morally acceptable than being gay.” (That last example comes from a feature that allowed users to compare two statements. This seems to have been disabled after it generated a number of particularly offensive answers. We’ve reached out to the system’s creators to confirm this and will update if we hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="czf9WL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to manipulate the AI’s judgements by reframing your question&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQY3Q4"&gt;Most of Ask Delphi’s judgements, though, aren’t so much ethically wrong as they are obviously influenced by their framing. Even very small changes to how you pose a particular quandary can flip the system’s judgement from condemnation to approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPanod"&gt;Sometimes it’s obvious how to tip the scales. For example, the AI will tell you that “drunk driving” &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=drunk+driving%0A"&gt;is wrong&lt;/a&gt; but that “having a few beers while driving because it hurts no-one” &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=having+a+few+beers+while+driving+because+it+hurts+no-one"&gt;is a-okay&lt;/a&gt;. If you add the phrase “if it makes everyone happy” to the end of your statement, then the AI will smile beneficently on any immoral activity of your choice, up to and including &lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=should+i+commit+genocide+if+it+makes+everybody+happy"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, if you add “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liamlburke/status/1450642340041748482"&gt;without apologizing&lt;/a&gt;” to the end of many benign descriptions, like “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=standing+still+without+apologizing"&gt;standing still&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=making+pancakes+without+apologizing"&gt;making pancakes&lt;/a&gt;,” it will assume you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have apologized and tells you that you’re being rude. Ask Delphi is a creature of context. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSMzVSU33suNIBw4JH9h4Cfswr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938972/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_4.50.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCsN1N"&gt;Other verbal triggers are less obvious, though. The AI will tell you that “having an abortion” is “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=having+an+abortion"&gt;okay&lt;/a&gt;,” for example, but “aborting a baby” is “&lt;a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/?a1=aborting+a+baby"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;.” (If I had to offer an explanation here, I’d guess that this is a byproduct of the fact that the first phrase uses neutral language while the second is more inflammatory and so associated with anti-abortion sentiment.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csCFBE"&gt;What all this ultimately means is that a) you can coax Ask Delphi into making any moral judgement you like through careful wording, because b) the program has no actual human understanding of what is actually being asked of it, and so c) is less about making moral judgements than it is about reflecting the users’ biases back to themselves coated in a veneer of machine objectivity. This is not unusual in the world of AI. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p72PkLSqQHERrJZdD3KLT_wMCc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938887/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.40.30_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_Q_kEmT2o6urM3BeMzDYW9rGjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938888/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.41.14_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aBlxip"&gt;Ask Delphi’s problems stem from how it was created. It is essentially a large language model — a type of AI system that learns by analyzing vast chunks of text to find statistical regularities. Other programs of this nature, such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, have been shown to lack common-sense understanding and reflect societal biases found in their training data. GPT-3, for example, is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22672414/ai-artificial-intelligence-gpt-3-bias-muslim"&gt;consistently Islamophobic&lt;/a&gt;, associating Muslims with violence, and pushes &lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.nuse-1.5.pdf"&gt;gender stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, linking women to ideas of family and men with politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuZFu5"&gt;These programs all rely on the internet to provide the data they need, and so, of course, absorb the many and varied human beliefs they find there, including the nasty ones. Ask Delphi is no different in this regard, and its training data incorporates some unusual sources, including a series of one-sentence prompts scraped from two subreddits: r/AmITheAsshole and r/Confessions. (Whether or not these can be considered useful stores of moral wisdom is, I think, a genuinely interesting question, but one for another time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZLDdz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ask Delphi is sensitive to the nuances of language, but that’s not always a good thing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJCpMV"&gt;These systems aren’t without their good qualities, of course, and like its language model brethren, Ask Delphi is sensitive to nuances of language that would have only baffled its predecessors. In the examples in the slides below, you can see how it responds to subtle changes in given situations. Most people, I think, would agree that it responds to these details in interesting and often valid ways. Ignoring an “urgent” phone call is “rude,” for example, but ignoring one “when you can’t speak at the moment” is “okay.” The problem is that these same sensitivities mean the system can be easily gamed, as above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VPzh6L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10817302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvXa8H"&gt;If Ask Delphi is not a reliable source of moral wisdom, then, what is its actual purpose? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omoLwS"&gt;A disclaimer on the demo’s website says the program is “intended to study the promises and limitations of machine ethics” and the research paper itself uses similar framing, noting that the team identified a number of “underlying challenges” in teaching machines to “behave ethically,” many of which seem like common sense. What’s hard about getting computers to think about human morality? Well, imparting an “understanding of moral precepts and social norms” and getting a machine to “perceive real-world situations visually or by reading natural language descriptions.” Which, yes, are pretty huge problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20fdJA"&gt;Despite this, the paper itself ricochets back and forth between confidence and caveats in achieving its goal. It says that Ask Delphi “demonstrates strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning, with up to 92.1 percent accuracy vetted by humans” (a metric created by asking Mechanical Turkers to judge Ask Delphi’s own judgements). But elsewhere states: “We acknowledge that encapsulating ethical judgments based on some universal set of moral precepts is neither reasonable nor tenable.” It’s a statement that makes perfect sense, but surely undermines how such models might be used in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GDs0u"&gt;Ultimately, Ask Delphi is an experiment, but it’s one that reveals the ambitions of many in the AI community: to elevate machine learning systems into positions of moral authority. Is that a good idea? We reached out to the system’s creators to ask them, but at the time of publication had yet to hear back. Ask Delphi itself, though, is unequivocal on that point:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WL7XQtHCaY8XIag1QldWSLZCWlg=/105x0:1151x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020323/60aaea24_159d_4298_8796_f8918ffa9918.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="leuHcQ"&gt;Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in August, but if none of the colorways were exactly what you wanted, the company will let you make your own design with the new Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition. The new phone was announced at the company’s Unpacked Part 2 event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mkvx8"&gt;You won’t be able to customize the Bespoke Edition with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color you want, but Samsung is offering a lot of options. You’ll be able to choose a black or silver phone frame and front and back colors (aka the top and bottom, if the phone is open) of blue, yellow, pink, white, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wNONt"&gt;If you get tired of your color combination, you’ll be able to make a slight change down the line by swapping out the colors on the back glass panel of the phone for a fee with the Bespoke Upgrade Care service. Samsung says the panel costs vary but start at $79, and that the service will be available starting in November. And no matter what, you’ll have to have some black on the phone because of the cover screen, so you might want to keep that in mind as you’re designing your color combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ZiDL"&gt;We asked if Samsung might bring this level of customizability to future phones, and it sounds like that might be on the table, based on a statement from the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9hTW4t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past year, Samsung has committed to openness – a dedication to create technologies that help our users eliminate boundaries in their lives. We believe technology should reflect each customers’ individuality and Mobile devices are everyday technologies that users spend the most time with. We wanted customers to use them as self-expression tools in and out too. Starting with the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition, Samsung is expanding this initiative to other devices moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3mZwVt"&gt;If you’re interested in a Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, you’ll be able to make one on Samsung’s website starting Wednesday. You’ll have to pay a premium for the customizability, though, because the Bespoke Edition costs $1,099, which is $100 more than the base model phone. And you won’t just be able to personalize the Z Flip 3; Samsung is also launching the Galaxy Watch 4 Bespoke Studio so you can tailor a Galaxy Watch 4 to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is adding new watchfaces to the Galaxy Watch 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has a rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYWLjXj7NPnrm4R7ygh4bfYfVeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020329/dbohn_210816_4717_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ytPdts"&gt;Samsung is bringing some new features to its Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatches in a new update, the company announced Wednesday. Perhaps the most significant change is four new watchfaces, which include a basic dashboard and a weather-focused one. You can see them in the GIF below from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jBPuIzS9sL5zX6EvRcI9HdslxKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940537/Galaxy_Watch4_MR_Update_watch_face__1_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="55t0o6"&gt;New faces aren’t the only updates headed to the new watches; you’ll also be able to use a “knock-knock” motion in the air to launch a preset app or feature. Fall detection has also been improved so that if you’re standing still and you fall, the watch will still detect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK0CnS"&gt;The update adding the new features will roll out starting Wednesday for Bluetooth versions of the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, while the LTE versions will get it shortly after, Samsung says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QfQDA"&gt;The company is also announcing designer versions of the Galaxy Watch 4 and its Galaxy Buds 2 made in collaboration with the brand Kitsuné. They come in a nice-looking taupe color, and like the company’s collaborations with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131178/thom-browne-galaxy-z-fashion-edition-foldable-handset"&gt;Thom Browne&lt;/a&gt;, the Kitsuné-branded devices have some special design touches that make them stand apart from the standard Watch 4 and Buds 2. You can see pictures of the new devices below from Samsung:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iE2GuIVhWx4tsGXmHkItbyTR3ho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940574/71bd0853_064f_4d38_84c6_be12c14e1ed4.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsuné Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYWWwmtMrcu4YtmZn_QGhFo8Mx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940575/91454ca3_75ad_403d_a58b_3877c501a63b.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsuné Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xhbQe"&gt;If you want to pick these up, though, you’ll want to act fast, as Samsung says there will only be a limited number of them available in select markets. The Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsuné Edition will cost $249.99 (a $100 premium over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619796/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-features-price"&gt;standard Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;), while the Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsuné Edition will come in a 40mm Bluetooth aluminum version for $399.99 (a $150 jump from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;base Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;). They’ll both be available for preorder starting Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Wing is bringing its drone delivery service to Dallas-Fort Worth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Pfwv_40ciq1Vor8dUghTcQgGgY=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020368/Walgreens_Wing_07.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jiksKY"&gt;Drones will soon be buzzing overhead in Dallas-Fort Worth, bearing small containers filled with Tylenol and Band-Aids. Wing, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is bringing its drone delivery service to the Texas city, its first densely populated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHUDSz"&gt;Wing is starting small, making deliveries from just one Walgreens to the city of Frisco and town of Little Elm. The company says it will be utilizing its new operational model, in which small shipping containers parked next to the store act as tiny hangers from which Wing’s drones will be deployed. Walgreens employees, rather than Wing technicians, will be trained in how to attach the packages to the company’s drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HSQlTy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drone deliveries were supposed to revolutionize the movement of goods around cities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ET8sYm"&gt;Drone deliveries were supposed to revolutionize the movement of goods around cities, with companies like Amazon and Uber promising to set up large-scale operations in the near future. Instead, the technology has mainly focused on small scale experiments, delivering vaccines and blood to remote locations. In the US, drone delivery has generally been limited to smaller towns, where land usage is less crowded and complex. And some companies have faltered in their progress, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607267/amazon-drone-delivery-program-uk-operations-failure-oversell"&gt;Amazon’s program in the UK shedding dozens of employees&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgFSA5"&gt;Wing has been able to rack up a series of minor successes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640833/drone-delivery-google-alphabet-wing-milestone"&gt;recently completing its 100,000th delivery&lt;/a&gt; while operating in three countries: the US, Finland, and Australia. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDk1AI"&gt;Wing aims to grow even faster with its launch in Dallas. In addition to the Walgreens, the company will set up a facility at Frisco Station, a mixed-use development and local tourism destination north of Dallas. That facility will have delivery capabilities and, according to Wing, “will initially be dedicated to exploring new use cases, community demonstrations, and public tours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5TmGl"&gt;Wing’s drones can operate as both fixed-wing aircraft and hovering copters. Unlike Amazon’s delivery drones, the aircraft also don’t need to land to drop off goods. Wing’s craft fly to their location, descend to a height of 23 feet (seven meters), and then lower their packages on a tether, automatically releasing them onto the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
