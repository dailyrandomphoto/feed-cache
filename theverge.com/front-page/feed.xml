    <title>Stardew Valley is now a cooperative board game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuTEoQc3_oukXHOEp5XRYaIn-E=/45x0:1395x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864499/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_2.30.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QfEfbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; has been adapted into board game form and is available to purchase now for $55, according to the game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1364322680804057090"&gt;Eric Barone (ConcernedApe)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; got its start as a popular, indie-take on farm sim classic &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, but now the video game will finally exist in physical form (without the need to go out and actually learn how to farm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXMB4V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; was developed over two years by Barone and board game designer Cole Meideros. The game aims to adapt the gameplay from the video game like farming, foraging, mining, and romance, into a customizable, but less open-ended form that you can actually finish in one sitting. The game is also designed for one to four players, meaning that just like the original game, you can play alone if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LLHint"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31Sz4vMWYes?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiJIV"&gt;Finishing the game requires completing “Grandpa’s Goals” and the Community Center bundles that you might already be familiar with from the video game version. Players complete tasks and collect resources by taking turns positioning their pawns around the board and engaging in an activity of their choice. Mining at the mines, fishing at the beach foraging in the wilderness, and of course, farming at the farm. The seasons advance one week at a time each round, meaning time and available resources change as the seasons do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstE3A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-the-board-game-available-now/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the board game, Barone stresses that it was designed to feature some amount of depth and complexity. “It’s easy to play once you learn the rules, but it’s not a short, casual game.” he says. He also provided &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3x4p8nw2yr1a3j/Stardew%20Rules%20for%20Download.pdf?dl=0"&gt;the rulebook&lt;/a&gt; so you can get a better sense of how difficult it is to set up and how many other mechanics there are to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yp3px"&gt;While the board game doesn’t initially seem as approachable as the video game it’s based on, the amount of detail that went into recreating &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in physical form seems really impressive. You can purchase &lt;a href="https://shop.stardewvalley.net/products/stardew-valley-the-board-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; now for $55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVgRt2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original voice of Siri makes an appearance in Persona 5 Strikers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FELCDkDxuCkGK86h9BnooNh781Q=/284x0:2597x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864292/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_1.39.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Solax Archive on YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njXIJQ"&gt;If you’ve spent the day playing through &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; and noticed the voice of the in-game digital assistant sounded familiar, it’s likely because it’s played by the original voice of Siri (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-strikers-got-siris-original-voice-actor-to-pl-1846337639"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Susan Bennett originally provided the voice for Apple’s digital assistant, and now she’s playing EMMA, the in-game AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJbVD0"&gt;You can hear what she sounds like in the role in the video below, around the 9:44 mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SbndlB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMEEm1JD5PY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=577&amp;amp;start=577" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V9oBKz"&gt;If you ask your iPhone for directions to the nearest camping store, though, you may notice that its response doesn’t exactly sound like the game. That’s because, while Bennett was the original voice for Siri when it debuted with the iPhone 4S running iOS 5 (though technically Siri existed with Bennett’s voice before it was ever added to the iPhone), &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/tech/mobile/bennett-siri-iphone-voice"&gt;she was replaced with the launch of iOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWtQRc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.typeform.com/blog/human-experience/siri-is-dying-long-live-susan-bennett/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typeform&lt;/em&gt; has an interview with Bennett&lt;/a&gt; about how she became the voice of Siri, and it includes tons of voice recordings from her, which you can compare to her work in &lt;em&gt;Strikers&lt;/em&gt;. You can also watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIn5DZU_NoA"&gt;Apple’s ad that introduces Siri on the iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for what Siri sounded like back then in case its current iteration has overwritten those memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IVpFcp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Check out Siri Susan as Emma on the new P5Strikers game!  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/P5Strikers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#P5Strikers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emma?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Emma&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GamingNews?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GamingNews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8QuoIBdav9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8QuoIBdav9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Susan Bennett (@SiriouslySusan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SiriouslySusan/status/1363211830877949954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52dK8d"&gt;This is the kind of extra mile we love to see game developers go. “We need someone to play the voice assistant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/resolutionroute/status/1363937521995042817?s=20"&gt;in the English version of the game&lt;/a&gt;. How about the person who played one of the first major voice assistants?” If you want to experience it for yourself, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22153815/persona-5-strikers-release-date-switch-ps4-steam-north-america"&gt;is out today on PlayStation, Steam, and Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6M2BpES99bGf7SKxeHXTeico5w=/447x227:2560x1636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864219/suburb2_9_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Otto1P"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-postal-service-awards-contract-to-launch-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet-301233896.html"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; its new mail truck after a years-long competition. The new truck will be built by Wisconsin-based defense contractor Oshkosh and can be fitted with both gasoline and electric drivetrains. But it won’t hit the road until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AazfM0"&gt;Oshkosh winning the contract is a potentially major blow to commercial electric vehicle startup Workhorse, which was one of the three remaining bidders. The company’s stock price plummeted following the announcement, and trading was halted multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjbnuN"&gt;The USPS has been looking to replace its existing mail trucks for years now, and it started taking solicitations for new designs back in 2015. The need for new trucks is urgent. The ones currently on the road are not only woefully out of date — they don’t even have air conditioning — but &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-postal-service-mail-trucks-hundreds-catching-fire-age-delivery-2020-7"&gt;they’re a major fire risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZFAgY"&gt;The switchover was supposed to start happening in 2018, but the program experienced multiple setbacks. The USPS repeatedly extended deadlines in the early going at the request of the bidding manufacturers, and then when they finally delivered the first prototypes, many of them were faulty, &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;according to an Inspector-General report released last August&lt;/a&gt;. The program was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;further delays once the COVID-19 pandemic hit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSbPnO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More cargo space, air conditioning, and hopefully fewer fires&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0dpdZU"&gt;The new truck has more cargo space, better ergonomics, and, yes, air conditioning. It’s also dotted with cameras that give a 360-degree view, helping power a front- and rear-collision avoidance system with visual and audio warnings as well as automatic braking. The big front windshield and low hood should also give drivers a much better view of the road and pedestrians or cyclists, which is a big improvement for the safety of people outside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh still has to finalize the design of the mail truck, which is part of the reason for the two-year wait. The defense contractor is getting a $482 million investment up front and is promising to make between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years. Oshkosh had been working with Ford during the bidding process, but it’s unclear whether Ford was still involved in the final product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qWq6d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10358184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBBgP5"&gt;The USPS and Oshkosh don’t say exactly how many of the trucks will be gas-powered and how many will be electric, just that the plan is to make both and that the vehicles will be designed in a way so that the powertrains can be switched to electric over time. The USPS says the gas engines will be “fuel efficient low-emission” but did not specify what it means by those terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqvBDw"&gt;President Biden said in January that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;wants to replace the entire government fleet to electric drivetrains&lt;/a&gt;, though that won’t be possible without the USPS, which accounts for about a third of those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYY0gs"&gt;“It’s disappointing that today’s announcement does not immediately commit to electrifying one of our nation’s largest vehicle fleets,” Robbie Diamond, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, said in a statement. “This contract is a golden opportunity to stimulate the domestic EV market and supply chain, and a commitment to electrifying the [postal fleet] would provide a clear incentive for further domestic EV industry development along the entire supply chain, from minerals to markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNcDd5"&gt;Workhorse was the last remaining bidder pitching a fully electric vehicle, and it put a lot of effort into surviving as a business just to make it to the end of this process. The company sold off a small drone division, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;ostensibly spun out a new startup in Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt; to make an electric pickup truck without Workhorse’s baggage, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;even paid $7 million to buy out its original partner in the bid&lt;/a&gt;, trucking manufacturer VT Hackney. Workhorse even &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000162828020014517/ex-101indenture.htm"&gt;tailored the fine print of a recent loan&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that it would pay less interest if it won the USPS contract. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now listen to WandaVision’s latest spoiler-filled bop on Spotify and Apple Music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7c5zLAGmBRA4Zk-U0Ij0BwGtns4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864153/wan_still_105_02_8a82d395.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7XLyxW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s seventh episode&lt;/a&gt; started to answer some of the biggest questions of the series, and — in line with its sitcom trappings — the show dropped one of its biggest reveals yet in a &lt;em&gt;very spoiler-y&lt;/em&gt; retro-style theme song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enkdac"&gt;Since the episode was released, the track has exploded in popularity to the point that Disney seems to have noticed by dropping the official soundtrack on services like Spotify and Apple Music a few days ahead of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1364329004573016067"&gt;planned release&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, February 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMfCic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; episode 7 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wgCsog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WandaVision’s seventh episode answers two big questions but introduces many more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7dMZuy"&gt;That’s right, you can now stream the official version of “Agatha All Along” to your heart’s content. The song, like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s other sitcom themes, was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez (best known for their work on the &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; soundtracks) featured at the end of the most recent episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h327Ni"&gt;“Agatha All Along” reveals that nosy neighbor “Agnes” is in fact the witch Agatha Harkness — who, as the song makes clear in an incredibly catchy manner, was behind at least some of the oddities of Westview all along as the villain of the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uXB0vL"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; padding-top: 80px;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0kHsXoIt6dONEdkgKgyjoK" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LJRiM"&gt;Since the episode was released, the song has already become a TikTok trend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lelandphilpot/status/1363286213390696455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;received a trap remix&lt;/a&gt;, and been re-created as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGS7TYmIZOQ"&gt;soaring orchestral number&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the kind of popularity that brings to mind another musical streaming hit: the massively viral “Toss A Coin To Your Witcher” from Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KHa3Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix blew the release for ‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,’ the hit song of the season","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="imnPBS"&gt;That song had similarly exploded in popularity across the internet when &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; was released, but it took Netflix over a month to get its act together and release an official version of the soundtrack on streaming services, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"&gt;almost entirely missing the moment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a mistake that the streamer hasn’t made since, and the viral soundtracks to more recent shows — like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbridgerton-covers-from-the-netflix-original-series-ep%2F1544579825&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22297497%2Fwandavision-spoiler-episode-7-soundtrack-song-disney-plus-spotify-apple-music" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;’s pop culture covers&lt;/a&gt; — have been available alongside the series’s debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPwTii"&gt;With the early release of the soundtrack, it seems that Disney has made a similar choice to ride the wave and not let “Agatha All Along” pass it by, even if it means bumping up a few release dates — until the next &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; theme song takes over TikTok, that is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn is back up after an outage</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZ6ecW"&gt;LinkedIn is back up after a worldwide outage affecting users on both mobile and desktop. The Microsoft-owned social network first started experiencing issues around 2PM ET, and LinkedIn confirmed things were back to normal at 4:21PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djJPYL"&gt;The company didn’t give a specific reason for the outage, though did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529"&gt;jokingly suggest&lt;/a&gt; the issues may have been due to a &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFhyA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pardon the interruption everyone. We're back on track now. Unconfirmed reports indicate it might have been Agatha all along.  &lt;/p&gt;— LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="044dPn"&gt;It’s rare for LinkedIn to experience outages. LinkedIn last experienced widespread issues in January last year, when users weren’t able to post to the service or make new connections. Today’s outage affected the entire website, and it wasn’t loading for most users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Qc7R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 5:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: LinkedIn is back up, so we have updated the headline and article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square goes even bigger on bitcoin with a new $170 million investment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFcd3LQW2nk9OTv8ok8LwSSZMjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864110/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjrdYk"&gt;Square has just made another colossal investment in bitcoin, more than tripling its last investment in the cryptocurrency with a $170 million purchase of tokens. The digital payments company, which is run by vocal bitcoin advocate and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, disclosed the investment in its &lt;a href="https://investors.squareup.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;quarterly earnings report on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYhadu"&gt;The company purchased about 3,318 bitcoins at an average price of $51,236, which signals remarkable confidence in bitcoin as it reaches record heights and invites renewed skepticism about its stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCq6AP"&gt;“Aligned with the company’s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,” reads the company’s press release announcing the purchase. “The investment is part of Square’s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xz6YI4"&gt;Square first announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;major bitcoin investment in October of last year&lt;/a&gt; when it purchased $50 million worth of tokens when a single bitcoin cost a little over $10,000. The current price of a single bitcoin is just under $50,000, following a slight dip after the currency’s months-long &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-slides-6-below-55-101731416.html"&gt;surge to an eventual all-time high&lt;/a&gt; of just over $58,000 earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung now lets you return a new Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Z Flip foldable after 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUiqDAVQreHNadozWuHKui33ck4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863967/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gtd5Xt"&gt;Samsung is extending the return period for its newest foldable phones to 100 days, the company announced on Tuesday. That means buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G and Z Flip 5G can purchase either device, use it for more than three months, and return it for a full refund. Samsung is calling this new program “Buy and Try,” and it’s the first time the company has launched a return initiative as generous as this for its mobile phones. The prior return window was 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTHTD"&gt;“This new initiative will help consumers try and see if a foldable device is right for them, as part of Samsung’s commitment to making foldable devices more accessible for everyone,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. Samsung says the program is launching today for purchases of either device made through its website and will run until April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUTGlw"&gt;The Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; is technically the fourth iteration of the company’s foldable line, and it released last fall as a vastly improved version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;original (and severely flawed) Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $1,999.99, though Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the device on its website for $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; with an eligible trade-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLIyhF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt; is Samsung’s third take on a foldable phone. Following a discount, it now retails for $1,199.99, though Samsung says you can &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/?link=galaxy-z-flip-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get one for as cheap as $649.99 with an eligible trade-in&lt;/a&gt;. Both store pages for the devices on Samsung’s website carry notices of the new 100-day return offer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s Michael Bolton singing about payment for order flow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Michael Bolton’s Symphony Sessions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fL-JMgBusLmudW68HTsa31GxDfY=/0x0:2776x1851/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863323/1186708925.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bobby Bank/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6S0ju"&gt;You know, when I think about the stock market, I don’t really think about Michael Bolton. But I guess Public — which refers to itself as “the investing social network” — was envious that Robinhood was getting all the press attention, so it hired Bolton to revamp his 1989 hit “How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.” The new version is a lament about payment for order flow, which was recently the subject of Reddit outrage and a point of inquiry in a House hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f364CJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make no mistake, Public is taking aim at Robinhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cGOa34"&gt;Bolton is absolutely solemn in the beginning — almost to the point of convincing me that this is a hostage proof-of-life video. But his voice is as lovely as ever as he launches into song. It’s not the first time he’s lampooned his late-’80s / early-’90s image as a lovelorn crooner; he did something similar for &lt;a href="https://musebycl.io/music/michael-bolton-belts-out-his-love-paneras-new-broccoli-cheddar-mac-cheese"&gt;Panera with “When a Man Loves a Woman.”&lt;/a&gt; In both instances, he got a paycheck &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that he has a sense of humor. Good for him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfvPSc"&gt;The practice Bolton is lamenting is a controversial one, payment for order flow, which was recently the target of Reddit’s fury. A market maker pays to see some portion of retail investors’ trades; this could &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; allow front-running of orders, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow"&gt;that’s illegal&lt;/a&gt; and also, separately, not very lucrative for the market maker. (Most of Reddit’s anger assumed front-running retail trades was the entire point of payment for order flow.) The payments are part of why apps such as Robinhood can offer trades for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZKkHm"&gt;And make no mistake, Public is taking aim at Robinhood. After the uproar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;around Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the GameStop debacle&lt;/a&gt;, Public announced &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trading-app-public-ends-payment-223452733.html"&gt;it would no longer engage in payment for order flow&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, a day before Robinhood was quizzed about payment for order flow in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290110/house-financial-services-robinhood-gamestop-squeeze-roaringkitty-hearing"&gt;largely incoherent House subcommittee hearing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/"&gt;Public announced it had raised $220 million&lt;/a&gt;. The very next day, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) asked Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev if he would commit to sending the proceeds from payment for order flow to his customers, a question he dodged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5kO5r"&gt;To continue putting pressure on Robinhood, Public is offering to cover any fees for transferring from your previous brokerage to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9hcRPv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNoLGhai6H4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="76C8Wg"&gt;In a second, perkier video, Bolton says, “Hey gorgeous! You did it. Congrats on breaking up with your brokerage.” He also says that once you’re on Public, you can follow him. This is true! &lt;a href="https://public.com/michaelbolton"&gt;Here’s his portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. He hasn’t invested in Panera — it’s on his “Watch list” — but Amazon, Apple, Disney, Peloton, and Spotify are all part of his Public portfolio. Well, investing in Spotify is probably a better way to make money off of it than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295315/spotify-ceo-interview-podcast-daniel-ek-music-stream-on"&gt;waiting for royalty payments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The thylacine remains extinct, but we still have pademelons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black-and-white image of a Tasmanian tiger, a four legged animal with a face similar to a dog and strips from its mid back to its tail. Its mouth is open in a yawn or growl." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MmfjOgiEuFEn6k3TXTPoFC22FCc=/0x0:1548x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863283/532470136.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin, the last captive thylacine.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by John Carnemolla / Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c3dCbH"&gt;There was some excitement online yesterday as word spread that a family of thylacines was potentially caught on camera. The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was declared extinct decades ago, so a confirmed sighting would certainly be cause for celebration. Unfortunately, wildlife biologist Nick Mooney at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) reviewed the photos and determined “the animals are very unlikely to be thylacines, and are most likely Tasmanian pademelons,” according to a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVrlSo"&gt;This isn’t the first time a possible thylacine has turned out to be a pademelon or &lt;a href="https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/has-a-living-thylacine-finally-been-spotted-probably-not/"&gt;a mangy fox&lt;/a&gt;. While there have been &lt;a href="https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/Documents/RTI%20025%20-%202019-20.pdf"&gt;reported sightings&lt;/a&gt; of thylacines, none have been confirmed since 1936. According to TMAG, the museum “regularly receives requests for verification from members of the public who hope that the thylacine is still with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNhyS2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a tasmanian, I really think the thylacine trail cam will be a pademelon. The guy has a history of mistaking pademelon for thys. For those wondering how: Padys are the right color and their fur will often make the illusion of stripes, especially down the base of their tail. &lt;a href="https://t.co/IFv6SXosvk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IFv6SXosvk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cantankerous Jabberwocky (@HikoryDikory) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HikoryDikory/status/1364093410987024387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eu0NwN"&gt;As seen in this 1935 video of Benjamin, the last captive thylacine, the animals had several distinguishing characteristics, including striped rumps and stiff tails. Still, it’s not hard to imagine a hopeful observer seeing thylacines in photos of other animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jPEQsD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YiYchw5LmVI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PTnin"&gt;As we mourn the thylacine once again, we can also appreciate the still-living Tasmanian pademelon. The small, bushy-furred nocturnal &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/no-the-tasmanian-tiger-has-not-been-re-discovered-20210223-p5755i.html"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt; were once part of the carnivorous thylacine’s diet. They’re now extinct in mainland Australia but are still thriving in Tasmania, and their continued existence deserves some celebration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAEjlJ"&gt;Take a moment to feast your eyes on the magnificence of these (verified) photos and videos of pademelons. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the struggles of Dying Light 2 developer Techland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhPNg2opa1C_OVO2pieLjVCLCeY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863253/Dying_Light_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Techland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kWzOv"&gt;In 2018, game development studio Techland &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17446380/dying-light-2-e3-2018"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be developing a sequel to its survival horror hit &lt;em&gt;Dying Light&lt;/em&gt;. The game was previously slated to release in the spring of last year, but it would go on to be &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/20/21073985/dying-light-2-delay-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;delayed indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;, with no clear release date or launch window yet announced as of January 2020. With the silence surrounding &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt; for over a year now, a pressing question is what might be causing the game to endure such a troubled development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyfY7t"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/techland-report-bleeding-talent-autocratic-management-bad-feedback/"&gt;recent report by &lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Kirk McKeand&lt;/a&gt; gives us some long-awaited answers, detailing the struggling state of the studio’s work environment and shining a light on many issues likely impacting the development of the &lt;em&gt;Dying Light &lt;/em&gt;sequel. The report includes snippets from 10 interviews with former and current employees at Techland, all of whom wished to remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roKk6G"&gt;The testimonies shared in the report claim that Techland is masked by an “autocratic management, poor planning, and a toxic work culture that trickles down from the top.” The report also claims the company’s management has negatively impacted both the morale and the workflow of its employees, which, in turn, is causing issues in &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt;’s ongoing development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WnybvS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the last two months alone, at least 20 employees left Techland&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yz76i"&gt;Many of the problems reportedly stem from high-ranking employees, including CEO Pawel Marchewka. Sources told &lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt; that Marchewka and managers at Techland rejected ideas from the studio’s experts, which causes roadblocks in the game’s development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CaZGi3"&gt;“Whenever an expert starts advising things that are not aligned with the board’s agenda, they slowly get isolated from the project and responsibilities,” another source tells me. “That leads to them leaving or eventually getting fired. To make a career at Techland, you have to be subservient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="u9GA6w"&gt;At one point, the studio hired industry veteran Marc Albinet, who was previously a game director at Ubisoft, to help restructure the studio’s design process. Yet, the 30-year industry veteran was unsuccessful in trying to get the new workflow proposal approved by upper management, the report says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW4hIo"&gt;In the last two months alone, at least 20 employees have left Techland, according to the report. With the studio's high turnover rate, a source claims &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2’&lt;/em&gt;s narrative has been rewritten “six times or so.” Due to the numerous rewrites, one source told the outlet it has no idea what the final product will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjzbGc"&gt;In response to staff retention, Marchewka told &lt;em&gt;TheGamer &lt;/em&gt;that “making games is tough and it is normal that sometimes there is a need to change the workplace and look for new challenges. I am very sorry that some of our employees left us and decided to find their way outside the structures of Techland, but I’d always wish them the best.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flw1K5"&gt;The report dives into other flaws at Techland and how its work culture is negatively impacting &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt;. I encourage you to take the time out of your day to &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/techland-report-bleeding-talent-autocratic-management-bad-feedback/"&gt;read the full report&lt;/a&gt; to get the inside look it offers at the struggles of game development. &lt;/p&gt;
