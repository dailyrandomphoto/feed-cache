    <title>Robinhood has figured out how to monetize financial nihilism</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And the financial system only has itself to thank&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="aALQOn"&gt;It’s sometimes hard to identify era-defining moments when they happen; usually you can only really see them after the wave rolls back. Helpfully, Robinhood has given us &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_842"&gt;a high place to stand&lt;/a&gt; so we can see a little farther — though I don’t think that’s the point of its S-1, which is a document filed in order to make an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBpZq8"&gt;Robinhood, you may recall, has been controversial. Just before the S-1 landed, we discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;$70 million fine from FINRA&lt;/a&gt;, a finance industry corporation that regulates its members; Robinhood was fined for — among other things — failing to protect its customers. This is the largest fine it’s ever handed out. (Seems weird to me that $53 million is for FINRA and only $17 million is for the investors who FINRA says were harmed, but whatever, finance industry gonna finance industry.) Anyway this is the consequences of those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;whoopsie outages&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020 around major trading days. Robinhood has also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;oopsies around Dogecoin in April&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess we’ll find out if anyone cares about that sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OFkQM7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Robinhood app has lovely design, but the app isn’t the product&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2zUFd"&gt;Robinhood’s messiness is part of the fun. There’s like, six pages of lawsuit disclosures in the S-1, including 50 class-actions stemming from January alone, some beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allegations from Massachusetts that Robinhood’s broken some laws, New York&lt;em&gt; just asking questions &lt;/em&gt;about money laundering, and so on. Oh, and the Northern California US Attorney’s Office has CEO Vlad Tenev’s cell phone. (The actual phone, not just his number.) On the positive side, Robinhood has settled a civil suit brought by the family of Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old novice trader &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/robinhood-sued-by-family-of-alex-kearns-20-year-old-trader-who-killed-himself-.html"&gt;who killed himself&lt;/a&gt; wrongly believing he’d lost more than $700,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kml2c7"&gt;Messiness aside, the financials suggest that Robinhood had a good Q1! There were 18 million “net cumulative funded accounts” on Robinhood by the end of the first quarter, according to the document. That’s 44 percent growth over the end of 2020, when there were 12.5 million such accounts. If you can cast your mind back to last January, there was that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStonk thing&lt;/a&gt;, where a bunch of retail traders piled into GameStop and sent the shares, in their parlance, &lt;em&gt;to the moon&lt;/em&gt;. Robinhood caught some flack — and, apparently, a pile of lawsuits — for restricting trading during that period, but it looks like the entire episode was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;net positive&lt;/a&gt;, even if it did piss some users off! &lt;em&gt;Laissez le bon temps rouler, bébé.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1YntO"&gt;But let’s talk about &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhoods-debut-is-clouded-by-sec-scrutiny-of-payment-for-order-flow-11625655600?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;payment for order flow&lt;/a&gt;, which, whew, 81 percent of first-quarter revenue! (Man, I’d personally put some eggs in another basket.) That tells you who Robinhood’s &lt;em&gt;clients&lt;/em&gt; are: Citadel et al, the people who pay for its service. So what, exactly, are they buying? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wVivU"&gt;Look, the Robinhood app has lovely design, but the app isn’t the product. Trades from Robinhood users are Robinhood’s real product. The main insight Robinhood had was that in a mobile-first world, they could outflank other brokerages by reaching retail customers. They were right about that! But it means we have to be clear about what the real value in the financial system looks like: data, and fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YCMfII"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s retail customers are n00bs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxkrLo"&gt;Robinhood loves to brag that it is giving access to people who have never traded before. To my eye, however, it seems like Robinhood is advertising that most of its users are &lt;a href="https://www.partypoker.com/en/how-to-play/school/advanced/tips/spot-a-fish"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; for a novice to enter the markets, understand them, and make money... but, man, it’s weird out here. Like, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/stablecoin-issuer-circle-to-go-public-in-4-5-billion-spac-deal"&gt;a stablecoin issuer is trying to SPAC&lt;/a&gt; for a cool $4.5 billion &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7676451f-23a9-42eb-a179-c3ebbcfc0bff"&gt;without saying exactly what’s backing the stablecoin&lt;/a&gt;. If you did not understand that sentence, that’s because&lt;em&gt; it’s fucking nonsense.&lt;/em&gt; I wish all the first-time investors the absolute best of luck in the markets; they will need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpYWfS"&gt;Goldman Sachs, underwriter of Robinhood’s S-1, is doing this IPO for the fees, as are the other banks listed. The big money is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-24/goldman-won-t-underwrite-just-anyone?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;serving as a middleman&lt;/a&gt; in a maximum number of transactions; Goldman made a couple billion on its &lt;a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2021-q1-results.pdf"&gt;underwriting business alone in Q1&lt;/a&gt;. Citadel is one of Robinhood’s actual clients; it works as a market maker, and to encourage Robinhood to route its trades to Citadel so Citadel can make money on &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/17/payment-for-order-flow/"&gt;the bid-ask spread&lt;/a&gt;, it engages in payment for order flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kappUE"&gt;The setup means that Robinhood makes its money when users trade. The more frequent the trading, the more money Robinhood makes. This is part of what makes the mobile-first design on Robinhood noteworthy — it’s a trading app for a group of users who are accustomed to reacting to our smartphone notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7xH5B"&gt;But it is also important to understand that Robinhood’s retail customers are n00bs. (They phrase it more politely, like this: “We take pride in the fact that we are expanding the market by welcoming new investors into the financial system.”) They’re also pretty young — about 70 percent of the assets under Robinhood’s custody come from people aged 18 to 40. Robinhood continues “to welcome an increasing proportion of women to our platform,” a hilariously indirect phrase. What do we think, ladies? Is Robinhood 70 percent men? 90 percent men? 95 percent? I wouldn’t have to contemptuously speculate if that number were &lt;em&gt;in the document&lt;/em&gt;, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lblahc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Intense buying by Robinhood users forecast negative returns”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzOlzm"&gt;The default settings on the Robinhood app turn on notifications for price movements; the user can choose whether the threshold is 5 percent or 10 percent. (There are also notifications for 52-week highs and lows.) It’s possible those notifications encourage users to make trades that aren’t in their interests; impulse selling, for instance. Of course, users can turn them off, but companies get to choose the default. The default for Robinhood isn’t to encourage buy-and-hold by requiring users to manually check in on their investments, allowing them to forget about them most of the time; instead, Robinhood wants to send notifications for movement, which might inspire trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjcC8u"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20Skill%20110523.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows that day traders &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/day-traders-in-brazil-study-would-ve-done-better-with-9-to-5-job"&gt;mostly lose money&lt;/a&gt;. And research that focuses on Robinhood specifically shows that their traders are &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776874"&gt;mostly noise&lt;/a&gt;. During “herding events,” when Robinhood users all crowd into a stock together, “intense buying by Robinhood users forecast negative returns,” &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry10mR"&gt;The users also seem to be crowding into weird assets. Robinhood was a part of the GameStonk mass meme, and also made almost $30 million on Dogecoin in the first quarter, a frankly astounding amount of money to make on a shitcoin. It is &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;astonishing, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance"&gt;Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out&lt;/a&gt;, that Robinhood made that much money in the quarter &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Dogecoin peaked. “Robinhood is the brokerage for fun gambling on meme stocks and meme cryptocurrencies,” Levine writes. And that is great for Robinhood’s customers, including Citadel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mxytxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meme trades aren’t the cause of widespread distrust, they’re the symptoms of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bO49wY"&gt;Okay, but what are the users getting out of it? Levine thinks &lt;em&gt;fun gambling,&lt;/em&gt; and that might be right, given the age bracket. Take the meme stocks — in June, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/business/dealbook/amc-meme-stocks.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; of them that “when stock prices are divorced from fundamentals, it cements the public perception that markets can be manipulated — by a small group of insiders or a large group of determined traders — and therefore can’t be trusted.” This is exactly backwards. That ship sailed a decade ago for everyone with student loan debt who couldn’t get a job because of the 2008 financial crisis, a result of Wall Street’s wild betting on the housing market. Oh, and the &lt;em&gt;adults&lt;/em&gt; who were &lt;a href="https://dealbreaker.com/2012/08/sp-has-a-perfectly-good-explanation-for-rating-deals-structured-by-cows-which-a-lucky-federal-jury-will-get-to-hear"&gt;supposed to protect us by evaluating risk&lt;/a&gt;? Why, they were telling each other that those deals’ models didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471995644960797"&gt;adequately capture the real risks&lt;/a&gt;. But it didn’t matter — the deals could even be “structured by cows and we would rate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTb8Tf"&gt;Are there any people under the age of 40 who have ever&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;thought markets were something besides a casino? Meme trades aren’t the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of widespread distrust, they’re the &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; of it. And those people under 40 who think finance is for gambling? They’re the lucrative part of Robinhood’s user base. Legal issues aside, it seems like Robinhood has a good business model for monetizing financial nihilism — which is the kind of thing investors might get excited about. Whether that’s good for Robinhood’s users or the financial system at large isn’t a question the S-1 is designed to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o7IfC8"&gt;You know who Robinhood might be good for, though? Tenev and his co-founder, Baiju Bhatt, who stand to get &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-robinhood-gives-founders-second-chance-14-billion-windfall-2021-07-09/"&gt;stock awards worth an estimated $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as executive compensation if Robinhood’s shares trade high enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s latest glass speaker is a more affordable dose of bizarre design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ydqGryP2jvVKLSdHXR-dCasp6Y=/1x0:1050x699/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574730/1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker features a “candlelight mode.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Rgnf7"&gt;Sony is releasing another one of its glass lantern speaker hybrids, and it comes in at $100 less than its predecessor. The &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-introduces-new-lspx-s3-glass-sound-speaker-creating-a-warm-and-inviting-atmosphere-in-any-space-301331110.html"&gt;LSPX-S3&lt;/a&gt; is a $349 wireless Bluetooth speaker that vibrates a glass tube to act as a tweeter, which Sony says allows it to send sound in all directions around it. There’s also a light inside the glass with 32 different brightness levels, allowing the speaker to act as a bedside lamp or candle-replacement on the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmimdZ"&gt;As its name suggests, the LSPX-S3 is Sony’s third with this unusual form-factor, and it’s also the cheapest yet. The original LSPX-S1 sold for $799 after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/25/11501594/sony-glass-sound-speakers-magnificent-expensive"&gt;launch in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/lspxs2"&gt;the LSPX-S2 cost $449&lt;/a&gt;. The third-generation speaker is still expensive (at $349), but the thought of buying two of them to pair together in stereo no longer seems patently ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dn3UTfQS2OM6Z6hL0lVXYt5qGKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714417/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glass tube serves as the speaker’s tweeter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xs96Oq"&gt;Alongside its glass tweeter, the LSPX-S3 also has a mid-range driver and a passive radiator for low-end notes. Battery life is rated for up to 8 hours, it charges over USB-C, and there’s support for Sony’s LDAC codec — which we consider the gold standard for Bluetooth audio if you’ve got a device that supports it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEh6c4"&gt;Sony’s new glass speaker will be available to order from August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We want to see your internet bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOFEWsVJrdkLKqootfNKmReCweU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574700/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62mluZ"&gt;You don’t always get what you pay for in internet access. Most places only have one option, so you’re stuck picking the good plan or the bad plan from a single carrier, and if the expensive “broadband” plan turns out to be closer to dial-up speeds, there isn’t much you can do. And that’s without getting into the big swaths of the country that don’t even have a broadband option on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEklvk"&gt;So we’re joining with &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; to take a close look at the problem, collecting as many internet bills as we can to get a sense of which telecoms are holding up their end of the bargain — and which ones are falling short. The idea is to get a bird’s-eye view of the speeds people are actually getting, and what they’re paying for those speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIG77B"&gt;To get there, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;we want to take a look at your internet bill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has put together a site to collect your information and do a quick speed test. The whole thing should take about seven minutes, and you’ll be doing your part to build a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqnNBK"&gt;A few quick notes on privacy: your bill will be encrypted as soon as you update it, and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has pledged to only record relevant data such as price, bundle, speed, and hidden fees, and they’ll delete bills when they’re no longer needed. The site will ask you to create a login as a way to keep the information private and safe, but you won’t have to pay for anything and no personally identifiable information will be shared with outside researchers. You can get more answers about the specifics &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/member-support/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGUVIC"&gt;We’re hoping this project will give us tens of thousands of bills to pore through, and spur on some great investigations for later on in the year. So &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;head over to the site and show us your bill&lt;/a&gt; — and in a few months, we’ll tell you what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor YouTube Shorts is rolling out globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juIwLzvirtAuXeatna55CVymfTk=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574531/Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8407lx"&gt;YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rolling out globally. The service launched first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, before expanding to around 26 countries including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Now YouTube Shorts, which is still in beta, will be available “across more than 100 countries around the world where YouTube is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x07o4W"&gt;YouTube Shorts is playing catchup to TikTok as the short-form video platform of choice, but Google’s service is pushing Shorts’ integration with the wider YouTube ecosystem as a key selling point. It recently added the ability for Shorts creators to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;sample audio from YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, and says it’s exploring ways to offer quick links from Shorts to YouTube videos they’ve taken samples from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnfBI6"&gt;Ironically, while YouTube is going to great lengths to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. It recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;tripled its maximum video length&lt;/a&gt; to three minutes for everyone, and has been slowly rolling out apps on TV platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PC market growth slows amid global chip shortages</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZeTBGP"&gt;The PC market is showing early signs of its growth slowing down, after an impressive run of shipments throughout 2020. Both &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48069721"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-4-point-six-in-second-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; conclude that growth in the second quarter of PC shipments has slowed this year. Demand for new PCs is still above what we saw before the pandemic hit, but a mixture of softer demand and the effects of the global chip shortage mean it’s not growing as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPJ0PG"&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned,” says Neha Mahajan, a senior research analyst at IDC. “With businesses opening back up, demand potential in the commercial segment appears promising. However, there are also early indicators of consumer demand slowing down as people shift spending priorities after nearly a year of aggressive PC buying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xsfmfd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hvCRw"&gt;IDC says more than 83 million PCs were shipped in the second quarter of 2021, while Gartner’s own figure is more than 71 million. Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in its results, but the research firm says “Chromebook shipments were once again strong in the second quarter of 2021.” Either way, both firms agree that year-over-year growth in this latest quarter wasn’t as strong as 2020’s sudden growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49cZN5"&gt;That doesn’t mean PC sales are about to suddenly plummet, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth we saw in a decade&lt;/a&gt; could be starting to wane. Lenovo is still the top PC manufacturer worldwide, and Gartner says Apple, Acer, and Asus all grew faster than the overall market thanks to better availability of consumer PCs. “The consumer PC market was less impacted by shortages than the enterprise market, as vendors can be more flexible in the system design of consumer models, enabling workarounds for certain supply constraints,” says Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVCSsc"&gt;While there are clearly early signs of slowing growth in the PC market, Microsoft and its OEM partners will be hoping to revitalize PCs even further later this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;Windows 11 will likely arrive in October&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft’s minimum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; mean many will need to upgrade PCs. A new version of Windows always comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9544645/microsoft-intel-dell-lenovo-hp-pc-does-what"&gt;big marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 will be no different. With Apple’s impressive M1 MacBooks and Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335654/intel-mac-guy-new-ads-commercials-pc"&gt;reviving the Mac vs. PC ads&lt;/a&gt;, this year is bound to be an interesting period for the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter admits it verified several fake accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zs5WZ_F5pDJbniXyHjh6ZpG-nhk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574450/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydNthB"&gt;Twitter says it has permanently suspended a “small number” of fake accounts it mistakenly verified just weeks after re-launching its public verification program, the &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/twitter-verified-bot-accounts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Dot&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The blunder came to light after data scientist Conspirador Norteño &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366"&gt;discovered six verified accounts&lt;/a&gt; which had been created recently on June 16th. None of them had posted a single tweet, and two used what appeared to be stock photographs for profile pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3XAES"&gt;“We mistakenly approved the verification applications of a small number of inauthentic (fake) accounts,” Twitter told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Dot&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “We have now permanently suspended the accounts in question, and removed their verified badge, under our platform manipulation and spam policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QoxCA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aykacmis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@aykacmis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/degismece?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@degismece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anlamislar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@anlamislar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aykacti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@aykacti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayitlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kayitlii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donmedim?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@donmedim&lt;/a&gt;, a sextet of blue-check verified Twitter accounts created on June 16th, 2021. None has yet tweeted and all have roughly 1000 followers (and mostly the *same* followers). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cc: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V82Wtu0SNr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V82Wtu0SNr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRztrJ"&gt;The incident suggests that Twitter’s verification process is having problems, and not catching the kinds of obviously inauthentic accounts that shouldn’t be worthy of the platform’s coveted blue badge. Twitter recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;relaunched public verification applications&lt;/a&gt; with a revamped set of eligibility criteria based around the idea that an account should be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;” to be worthy of verification. Clearly, the accounts identified were none of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpG38y"&gt;As Norteño explains in a Twitter thread, the six accounts had 976 suspicious followers in common — all created between June 19th and June 20th — and large numbers of these were using AI-generated profile pictures. In total, Norteño says they were part of a botnet consisting of at least 1212 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rOd7BW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These 976 accounts are part of an astroturf botnet consisting of (at least) 1212 accounts. The network is split into followers, which follow the aforementioned verified accounts as well as other members of the botnet, and followees, which are followed by the other bots. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wKKfC2PRX8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wKKfC2PRX8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475941980655617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPWD3G"&gt;As of this writing, Twitter has suspended five out of the six verified accounts, while the sixth appears to have deactivated its own profile. The “majority” of the supporting botnet has also been taken down, Norteño says. But the incident raises questions about how the accounts were able to get verified in the first place, and why Twitter’s processes didn’t flag them before they were discovered by a third-party researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Super Mario and Tag Heuer collaboration is a $2,150 Wear OS watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5kHh__OEI1AW31aWI-hMiWW2Vs=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574420/tagmario.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1VjkiC"&gt;A few days ago, Tag Heuer posted a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570322/tag-heuer-nintendo-super-mario-watch-tease-collaboration"&gt;teaser for a Super Mario-themed watch&lt;/a&gt;. You might have assumed that a Swiss-made mechanical timepiece was in the works, but now the news is out: it’s actually a limited edition version of Tag’s Connected Wear OS smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NduSUi"&gt;Tag Heuer seemingly hasn’t released details itself yet — its &lt;a href="https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/announcement/coming-soon.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is still counting down to a July 15th announcement — but &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/this-limited-edition-super-mario-smartwatch-will-run-you-2150/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.worldtempus.com/article/watches/trends-and-style/tag-heuer-teams-up-with-pop-culture-icon-super-mario-30306.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WorldTempus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all posted stories with the device’s key features. The hardware itself appears to be identical beyond some light cosmetic tweaks to the 45mm case, including an M-for-Mario logo on the crown, and it comes with two straps: one with perforated red rubber alongside one with red rubber and black leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve1tK8"&gt;The watch is said to use a “gamification rewards system” with greetings from Mario and Mushroom Kingdom-themed animations that play as you hit various steps goals throughout the day. There are four new Mario watch faces, including a “Timekeeping” face that features “retro elements from the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. with Mario, all in pixels.” (As opposed to the physical steel that other smartwatch faces are cast from, presumably.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqdI2OJxqATzdHAsqNvZyUOvKEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714327/tm2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oaS4Xz"&gt;Tag Heuer says it’s “considering making [these Mario features] available on other editions of TAG Heuer Connected at a later stage.” That may be good news for anyone who bought the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/12/21176639/tag-heuer-connected-third-generation-luxury-smartwatch-sensors-design-watch-style"&gt;most recent version&lt;/a&gt;, which started at $1,800 and could cost as much as $2,350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPuhF"&gt;The new Mario watch falls toward the high end of the Connected range, coming in at $2,150. It’s also a lot more exclusive — Tag Heuer is only making 2,000 models, which will be available through some of its own boutique stores and its website in certain regions from  July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7B3nex_Wy7DaA0l1tS7PzDlklJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714329/tagm3.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Space Jam: A New Legacy launch includes a 91,000 item NFT tie-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lola Bunny, LeBron James and Daffy Duck in Space Jam: A New Legacy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lTXx1p-RXyBeIUEcD3vZwRdUou0=/189x0:1809x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573829/rev_1_SJM_T1_0082_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2GpohM"&gt;On the same day we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is adding a LeBron James skin to its metaverse&lt;/a&gt;, the PR machine for &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt; cranked out a different batch of digital collectibles. However, instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365635/space-jam-sequel-new-legacy-first-trailer-1996-website"&gt;directing viewers&lt;/a&gt; to a gloriously aging &lt;a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/"&gt;90s-era website&lt;/a&gt;, they had to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fx4dhO"&gt;Launching July 16th &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt; follows Michael Jordan’s 1996 movie by transporting LeBron James into a digital world full of cartoons and other Warner Bros. properties, so the marketing fit makes more sense than it might appear. The difference here is that instead of merely slipping toys into fast food kids’ meals or tossing out limited edition physical cards, there’s a hope that interest in the family-friendly flick will spur the collection of non-fungible tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lHIS5x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is an NFT, anyhow?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ajS4Le"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; tie-in serves as a launch event for &lt;a href="http://Niftys.com"&gt;Niftys.com&lt;/a&gt;, a marketplace for the tokens that bills itself as “the ultimate destination for creators, collectors, and curators.” Topps, Mark Cuban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; creator Dapper Labs, and Samsung Next are among its financial backers, and they all hope they own a piece of the next big collecting trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Msp7o4"&gt;The website suffered some outages when it initially launched but is back up and running, &lt;a href="https://niftys.com/events/spacejam"&gt;promising a free NFT to anyone who registers&lt;/a&gt; (you can get one more for sharing a social network post about the event). Your one-of-a-kind digital item is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/space-jam-new-legacy-nft-lebron-james-1235016220/"&gt;one of 91,000&lt;/a&gt; that have been minted on its blockchain for the event, giving this more of a breakfast cereal prize giveaway vibe than a hunt for a golden ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YiABQjAwXOEz1SuGUOiL77u-6oU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714024/niftys_space_jam_nft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Niftys.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Niftys Space Jam NFTs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OyhGi0"&gt;As a child of the ‘80s and ‘90s, I’m a bit too jaded to believe these will be worth more than most of the trading cards, pogs, and beanie babies I remember, but at least they’ll only take up hard drive space instead of clogging landfills. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the environmental impact of blockchain technology has become controversial&lt;/a&gt;, Niftys claims its implementation uses Palm NFT Studio to reduce energy consumption by 99 percent compared to other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSTXMR"&gt;At press time, there are still Space Jam NFTs available “while supplies last,” and the &lt;a href="https://niftys.com/events/spacejam"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; lists 57,367 / 91,980 NFTs, although it’s unclear whether that is the number available or already claimed. While snagging an NFT so it can become part of your playlist, viewable as a spinning GIF of one of the movie’s characters, is surely enticing, most people will be in it for the scarcity. Free or purchased (at $2.99 each), the cards each feature one of nine characters and come in five tiers of rarity. There are ten “legendary edition” 3D cards available, and if you’re not lucky enough to own one of them, then at least you can still see the exact same image &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRO71mTJVFw/"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ESPN Plus is getting its second price hike of 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdBrJqiEvkQnOePHxnYYjONej7c=/0x27:1396x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573508/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiSPvS"&gt;ESPN Plus monthly and annual subscription costs will go up beginning August 13th, the second price increase for the service in 2021. The new price hike has made the service’s annual plan increase by about $20 this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBBD2"&gt;A spokesperson for ESPN Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the service will hike from $6 to $7, while the annual cost will jump from $60 to $70. Notably, there will be no price increase to the Disney bundle, which costs $13 and includes sister services Disney+ and Hulu. There will also be no change in the cost of UFC pay-per-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13dflw"&gt;Disney Plus and ESPN Plus have both gotten price increases in 2021. The sports streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22207151/espn-plus-annual-subscription-price-hike-disney-ufc"&gt;annual subscription cost increased&lt;/a&gt; to $60 per year from $50 in January. The company attributed the most recent price increase to increased value to consumers, specifically citing its live sports coverage, original programming, and expanded editorial analysis from industry experts. The service reported having nearly 14 million subscribers as of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Hyy8"&gt;Disney’s marquee streaming service, meanwhile, also got a little pricier in 2021. In March, Disney Plus increased to $8 per month or $80 annually, arguably still a fantastic value for the quality of content being produced and certainly accounting for the fact that Disney’s new releases typically arrive on the service at no additional cost a few months after their Premier Access debuts. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, for example, will be free to stream on the service beginning October 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shares transition plans for unified desktop file syncing Drive app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0ywiaJyQPHnVKXb4ekdOMBKg_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573184/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxV1mf"&gt;Google announced its plans to transition users of its consumer file syncing desktop service, Backup and Sync, onto &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;a new unified app&lt;/a&gt; that both consumers and business clients can use called Drive for desktop. Google plans to start &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/google-drive-backup-and-sync-transition.html"&gt;onboarding users next week on July 19th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and encourages people who used Backup and Sync to make the switch by the end of September, before getting locked out on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LcKT3"&gt;Backup and Sync users will have to transition to the new app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/10309431#zippy=%2Csee-the-full-list-of-features%2Cwhy-are-you-making-this-change%2Ci-use-drive-file-stream-how-will-this-affect-me%2Ci-am-a-workspace-admin-and-my-organization-uses-drive-file-stream-im-concerned-about-these-new-features-what-can-i-do"&gt;a renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s enterprise file syncing software), but business clients who are already using Drive File Stream (aka Drive for desktop) should be good to go, Google says. The goal with consolidating the apps, Google says, is to create “a powerful and unified sync client” with the best features from both consumer and enterprise services that should be more straightforward to use and easier for IT teams to manage. Notably, it’s also a reversal of Google’s confusing decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267624/google-drive-desktop-app-shutdown"&gt;split up Google Drive on desktop&lt;/a&gt; into two apps in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWxHSx37nP4tZcFbWkoEKDPlIR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713290/image1_iF7NAcN.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Drive for desktop client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dokMkN"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;Google’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining the desktop Drive client, the app should be pretty familiar to anyone who used Google’s previous services. Drive will offer easy access to files and photos stored in the cloud, and sync whatever files you choose in the background so they’re always up to date. Google says the app can sync external storage devices like flash drives to Drive, mirror files between Drive and local files on your desktop computer, and let you choose whether you store individual photos and videos in Drive or Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqPSHb"&gt;Google will begin transitioning users of Backup and Sync next Monday, July 19th. Here’s the following transition timeline for users, from Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BqNeD8"&gt;July 19th, 2021: Backup and Sync will support a guided flow to help users transition on to Drive for desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BSTf2"&gt;August 18th, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will start to receive in-product notifications prompting them to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIR1uV"&gt;October 1st, 2021:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Any users still on Backup and Sync after that point will no longer be able to sign in to Backup and Sync. To continue syncing with Drive and/or Google Photos, users will need to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TZPcJ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OaYSF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
