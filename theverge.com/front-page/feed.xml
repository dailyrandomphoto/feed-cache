    <title>Here’s the sliding interior of Hyundai’s new Ioniq 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9A_7wQ_Xw4vfafy48vBhT-Sxo-Y=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68823735/hyundai_ioniq_5_interior_console.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cDgGM2"&gt;Hyundai is teasing the first interior photos of the Ioniq 5 ahead of its world premiere on February 23rd. It’s Hyundai’s first EV to utilize the Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) — the same platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;Apple is said to have been interested in&lt;/a&gt; for its oft-rumored self-driving car. E-GMP’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;flat battery and long wheelbase&lt;/a&gt; allows for a more spacious and customizable interior for both passengers and cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhvfM1"&gt;The big design flourish &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3254"&gt;teased today&lt;/a&gt; is a sliding center console inside the Ioniq 5. The so-called “Universal Island” moves out of the way so that the driver or passengers can easily enter and exit either side of the car when parked in a narrow spot, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQ-F9kHmqqZFH2UPZSyVvJOWLG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306589/hyundai_ioniq_5_interior_console.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Universal Island” slides out of the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szf54L"&gt;Hyundai says that the driver and front-passenger seats are equipped with leg rests to relax while the vehicle recharges. The seats can also be repositioned so that adults in the front can care for pets and children seated in the rear. Hyundai notes that the Ioniq 5’s interior will be clad with eco-conscious materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBhaZlQEjT4DfS-7yB56aiU_214=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306590/ioniq_design_front_pc.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ioniq 5 teaser ahead of world premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d4NKF7"&gt;The Ioniq 5 appears to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21037218/teslas-holiday-update-fsd-voice-to-text-camp-mode-trax-music-making-kit"&gt;Tesla’s Camp Mode&lt;/a&gt; in its sights with a feature that effectively turns the car into a rolling generator with 3.5 kW of Vehicle to Load (V2L) power. That’s enough juice to power beefy 110V/220V appliances like a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQZ_l8eQfAI"&gt;full-sized oven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXS-ZHF3FNU"&gt;treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1B76EZBIw"&gt;five giant speakers&lt;/a&gt;, as Hyundai’s already teased. Tesla’s can’t do that without hacking an inverter into the circuitry and possibly voiding your warranty. The Ioniq is fitted with V2L outlets on the inside and outside of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bda4Ol7aNVkZy_m0JS_hB6A6I-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306610/ioniq_design_v2l_inside_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V2L jack on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Zg-LlBXroa-ShAiwiANi2GcGgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306611/ioniq_design_v2l_outside_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and the outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqBhNt"&gt;Other known capabilities of the Ioniq 5 include ultra-fast charging which allows it to drive more than 100km (62 miles) after a 5-minute charge. Hyundai has previously claimed that E-GMP vehicles will be capable of over 500km (310 miles) on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeBrXK"&gt;Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 will make its world premiere on February 22nd at 11pm California time, or 8pm in Germany on the morning of the 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Office app now available on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Office" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nv8rPa2FpZNoNYUm7b2eMxhjjqw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68823683/1211180727.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7w9rp"&gt;Microsoft has updated its unified Office mobile app to work on Apple’s iPad devices. The new &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id541164041"&gt;Office app&lt;/a&gt; combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single application, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20942023/microsoft-office-ios-android-app-features-word-excel-powerpoint"&gt;originally launched&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android back in 2019. Microsoft has been gradually improving it ever since, but it always ran in a windowed mode instead of a fully optimized iPad app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llZuYY"&gt;This new update means Office is now a full iPadOS app, with access to all of the regular tablet variants of Microsoft’s productivity suite. The app also bundles in some useful tools designed primarily for mobile tasks. These include the ability to quickly create PDFs or sign documents, converting images to text and tables, and more quick actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbQaWC"&gt;Microsoft has been simplifying its mobile Office offerings into this single app, but standalone apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are still available and updated regularly. While it took a while for the main Office app to be iPad-friendly, Microsoft has added many iPad-specific features to its Office apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534936/microsoft-office-ipad-mouse-trackpad-support-available-download"&gt;including mouse and trackpad support recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revel introduces a $99-a-month e-bike subscription for NYC residents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uW6GrHXTpsRJF348RzqDKzy-Veo=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68823671/E_Bike_Asset_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fqFQS"&gt;Electric moped rental company Revel is expanding its product lineup to include monthly e-bike subscriptions for residents of New York City. It’s the latest company to try to capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;the e-bike boom&lt;/a&gt; by shifting to a Netflix or Spotify subscription model for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33cjHK"&gt;For $99 a month, interested customers can get a stylish electric bike manufactured by NYC-based e-bike company Wing delivered straight to their door. The price also includes complimentary maintenance, including flat tires fixes, loose chains repairs, or brake upkeep. Service requests can be submitted via Revel’s smartphone app, and Revel says a repair technician will respond within 24 hours. The company will also supply a bike lock and educational material to help subscribers navigate New York City’s less-than-bike-friendly streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojKIX6"&gt;In an interview, Revel CEO Frank Reig said he watched his fellow New Yorkers embrace cycling in much greater numbers during the early months of the pandemic, and was determined to meet that demand with a product of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBQAQG"&gt;“We’ve been listening to our users to understand what they want and what they need,” Reig said, “and being ready to deliver a vehicle at a time when it couldn’t be more needed for a city like New York.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vxrQv4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“being ready to deliver a vehicle at a time when it couldn’t be more needed for a city like New York”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2xBI2"&gt;It’s an interesting move from Revel, the shared electric scooter company that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;operating in New York City since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also very much in line with where things are headed for micromobility companies that survived the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Scooter company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;Lime recently added electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; to its lineup, as well as e-bikes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;acquiring Uber’s bike-share company Jump&lt;/a&gt;. Bird also dabbled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;electric bikes and mopeds&lt;/a&gt; before deciding to stick with scooters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2z8NiLRDPN2Oe-DXSCPgE7wcIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300096/E_Bike_Asset_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3MY05n"&gt;With e-bikes typically costing between $1,400 and $3,000, subscriptions are seen as a more affordable alternative to personal ownership. The founders of SoundCloud recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332640/dance-ebike-subscription-berlin-soundcloud-price"&gt;launched an e-bike subscription service&lt;/a&gt; in Germany called Dance. Swapfiets is another service that is well-established in some European markets. The Dutch company just &lt;a href="https://news.swapfiets.com/nl-NL/190131-swapfiets-breidt-verder-uit-in-europa"&gt;recently added e-bikes to its roster&lt;/a&gt; of products and launched in Berlin in July. And in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt; have been experimenting with subscriptions for its electric scooters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. Another company, Unagi, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;offers its electric scooters for $39-a-month&lt;/a&gt; in some US cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okzim3"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service, Book, in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231451/bmw-access-subscription-shut-down-nashville-cancel"&gt;BMW recently discontinued&lt;/a&gt; its $2,000-a-month Access by BMW service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xY0Kz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;subscriptions are seen as a more affordable alternative to personal ownership&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPVVc"&gt;Revel’s in the shared moped business; why not something similar for e-bikes? Asked whether Citi Bike’s exclusive contract with the city of New York meant Revel couldn’t have launched a shared e-bike service, Reig said Revel wanted to avoid blocking the sidewalks like most scooter companies. “We don’t want to be on the sidewalk,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmlYD9"&gt;It’s also Revel’s latest effort to grow beyond mopeds. The company recently announced plans to building a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/"&gt;DC fast-charging station&lt;/a&gt; for electric vehicles in New York City, where it is based. Revel first launched its shared moped service in Brooklyn in 2018, eventually expanding in Manhattan and Queens. And it has been growing ever since landing a $27.6 million investment from a group of backers including Ibex Investors, Toyota AI Ventures, Blue Collective, Launch Capital, and Maniv Mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FWcrD9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uQnB22"&gt;Now the company is ready to branch out into a new mode of electrified transportation, though not too divergent from its fleet of battery-powered mopeds. Wing has been making and selling e-bikes since 2018, when it first released its stylish, VanMoof-looking Freedom model. Its latest models, the Freedom 2 and Freedom X, are cleaner versions of that original bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHjgGT"&gt;The Freedom 2 includes an integrated 36-volt battery and a 550W Bafang hub motor. It has a top speed of 20 mph and a range 60 miles, depending on which power setting you’re in. The Freedom X includes the same parts, as well as a hidden digital display and torque sensors that regulate the motor based on how hard you’re pushing the pedals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NQePwZWAqJz5GgskKBQG2dKPlAw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14131948/akrales_190219_3235_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9J8DcL"&gt;Seth Miller founded Wing after his first e-bike was stolen from in front of his office building. The company that manufactured the bike had disbanded, so he started researching different suppliers. He soon discovered that a majority of the e-bikes sold in the US are just cobbled together from a variety of off-the-shelf Chinese-made parts found in a catalog. It sounded simple, so Miller figured he’d try it himself. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18234875/wing-ebike-electric-bicycle-nyc-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewed the original Freedom in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and found it to be a stylish and affordable ride.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TCBOO"&gt;“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with a fellow NYC company that shares our vision for modernizing and electrifying urban transportation in an environmentally friendly way,” Miller told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Simply put, New York is better with bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHbJO6"&gt;Mopeds are arguably a faster way to get around than e-bikes, but they can also be more dangerous, especially for novice riders. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344993/revel-suspends-electric-moped-nyc-people-killed"&gt;Revel was forced to temporarily shut down&lt;/a&gt; its service in New York City last year after two customers were killed and one was critically injured while riding the shared electric mopeds. The company eventually resumed service with &lt;a href="https://gorevel.com/safety/"&gt;new protective measures for riders&lt;/a&gt; like a mandatory in-app safety test and a requirement that all riders take a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before they’ll be allowed to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqGpqD"&gt;Revel is also partnering with helmet company Fend to offer a discount on its foldable bike helmets. The e-bike subscription service will be called Coast by Revel and interested customers can joining a waitlist, after which Revel will start delivering bikes starting in March. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metro Exodus is getting ray tracing on the PS5 and new Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWNir89RT0MCGDGj2fZ-M6p2CUI=/0x0:726x484/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68823617/MetroExodus_PCEnhanced_Church_Screenshot_WithLogo2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot for the new PC version shows the upgraded ray tracing technology. | Image: 4A Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSFAdA"&gt;Metro Exodus developer 4A Games has revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/the-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-announced-plus-more-details-on-our-ambitious-gen-9-console-upgrades"&gt;free upgrades&lt;/a&gt; that are coming to its 2019 shooter on PC and next-gen consoles this year. The new version-specific features vary by platform, but include overhauled ray tracing support and support for Nvidia’s DLSS 2.0 technology on PC. Also revealed are improvements coming to the next-gen console version, &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/the-future-of-metro-4a-games-reveal-their-plans-for-the-series/"&gt;first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCD8Uu"&gt;On PC, the update will be released as Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, and it’ll be free regardless of whether you own the game on Steam, the Epic Games Store, or GoG. Although the game supported ray tracing at launch, the new version significantly upgrades it with support for new features like advanced ray traced reflections. Other upgrades coming to the new PC version include DLSS 2.0 support, which can offer significant boosts to performance when using Nvidia hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQnXCuRanKO7OrTWHLA4r6ii3KE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306575/NextGen_PCEnhanced_EN_Website.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 4A Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full list of the features coming to each platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LHrSmD"&gt;Meanwhile, the developer has also detailed the improvements coming with the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game, which will be available free to existing owners. On PS5 and Series X the game will run at 4K/60fps with ray tracing. Series S will target a lower 1080p resolution, but it’ll still run at 60fps and feature ray tracing. The next-gen console versions should also feature reduced loading times, and other platform-specific features like support for the PS5’s Dual Sense controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lumNpt"&gt;4A Games says the PC Enhanced Edition is releasing later this spring, while the next-gen console upgrades are coming “later this year.” The developer also reiterated its plans to release the game on Mac and Linux. The Mac version is releasing next month, and the game is coming to Linux “a little later in the year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PocketBook launches 7.8-inch e-reader with new color E Ink screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1QkzsYTpTcXhgNK19UzlTTXvudA=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822939/01_ENG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0RTk0"&gt;E-reader company PocketBook has announced and released the InkPad Color, a 7.8-inch device that uses E Ink’s latest color technology. PocketBook tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s the first device with a new Kaleido panel to be available in the US and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMraW3"&gt;According to the company, the new version of Kaleido has a different color filter pattern that offers better contrast and color saturation than the first Kaleido, which is itself pretty new technology. PocketBook also says that the screen refresh rate has been improved in software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFD6Y9"&gt;The specs of the new Kaleido panel are otherwise similar to the previous generation, with 300-dpi resolution for monochrome content and 100 dpi when displaying colors. The overall screen resolution has been increased to 1404 x 1872, owing to its larger physical size. The InkPad Color weighs 225g and is 8mm thick, so it should still be pretty portable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_t5FBm6rDg5eOrBstHc6462Q_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306149/03_ENG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fVquvL"&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507390/pocketbook-color-review-e-ink-kaleido-e-reader"&gt;I reviewed the PocketBook Color&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of the first Kaleido e-readers on the market anywhere in the world. I was generally impressed with the screen technology, but found the 6-inch panel too small to be practical for use cases like magazines and comic books. A larger, improved display could make the InkPad Color a much more useful device — hopefully we can see for ourselves soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha9Muj"&gt;The InkPad Color is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpocketbook-inkpad-color-16gb-internal-memory-7-8-e-ink-new-kaleido%2Fp%2F0VG-00FH-00009%3FItem%3D9SIAM05DST5007&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F15%2F22284923%2Fpocketbook-inkpad-color-kaleido-e-reader-available-now-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;already available on Newegg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VJK1Y1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $329.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12’s dessert name might be Snow Cone, but we thought of 17 better ones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BkcHu0u8Fqv9lSN-LN_RLDSP5Ys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822231/wjoel_180413_1777_android_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmsRY4"&gt;We’re eagerly awaiting to hear official news about Android 12, Google’s next major update to its mobile operating system, and we might have gotten an early look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;some big UI changes&lt;/a&gt; just last week, thanks to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;. But now, thanks again to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, we might know something even more important: Android 12’s dessert name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJU2lH"&gt;For years, Android releases were also identified with dessert names, and each year’s dessert started with the next sequential letter in the alphabet. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827231/android-10-q-google-name-officially-announced-new-logo-wordmark-desserts"&gt;deserted the dessert names&lt;/a&gt; in favor of numerals with Android 10, but the company reportedly still uses dessert names internally. Android 11’s dessert name was apparently &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-red-velvet-cake/"&gt;Red Velvet Cake&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Android 12’s name? &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-snow-cone-dessert/"&gt;it’s Snow Cone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpPWZI"&gt;Snow Cone is... fine. But if I’m being honest with you, I can’t think of the last time I’ve eaten a snow cone. And “Snow Cone” doesn’t immediately get my mouth watering like some of Google’s other classics, like “Ice Cream Sandwich”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjFZGK"&gt;The skeleton crew at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this fine Monday (it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/presidents-day"&gt;federal holiday here&lt;/a&gt; in the US) felt we could do better. So we thought of 17 other dessert names that start with “S” that, in our opinion, would be more delectable names for Android 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mTcAqY"&gt;S’mores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TwfaTb"&gt;Salted Caramel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GXUCl5"&gt;Saltwater Taffy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eJH8bG"&gt;Sheet Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jX4Aao"&gt;Sponge Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s3KpGi"&gt;Strawberry Shortcake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AoRH1f"&gt;Shortbread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tlCk4O"&gt;Soufflé&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RWcAuC"&gt;Sundae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YQ5jT6"&gt;Sherbet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RjokSX"&gt;Soft Serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GTTvP"&gt;Stracciatella&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nLhJ4k"&gt;Sugar Cookie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="omvSmE"&gt;Samoas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y38w9k"&gt;Snickerdoodle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ltKqU"&gt;Streusel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j6DB2b"&gt;Stroopwafel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PJkpSu"&gt;I hope you’re hungry after reading all those names, because I sure am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpxCvP"&gt;Other recent reports may point to other new rumors about Android 12. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-ui-changes-material-next/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “we have learned that Google has internally dubbed some of its notification UI changes as the start of the ‘road to Material NEXT,’” which could suggest broader changes on the way for Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17339230/google-material-design-theme-update-new-tools-matias-duarte"&gt;Material Design guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. There may also be changes to the pattern unlock UI, Quick Settings panel, and more in Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCwQLU"&gt;Google may be implementing a one-handed mode for Android 12, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-ui-changes-material-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt;. And Google might introduce a way for Pixel phones to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/pixel-android-12-auto-rotate-face-based/"&gt;check which way your head is facing&lt;/a&gt; to prevent rotating your screen when, for example, you’re lying sideways on your bed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku is testing a new, rechargeable remote — but it charges via Micro-USB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHH18EQD3cfgzYRyKkw8VDsMliM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822033/akrales_161121_1270_A_0051.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQynBi"&gt;Roku is testing a new version of its remote control for its set-top boxes, the Roku Voice Remote Pro, which ditches the AAA batteries for a built-in rechargeable battery instead, &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-02/roku-rechargeable-remote/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Zatz Not Funny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pn1EP"&gt;Along with the rechargeable batteries the new model — revealed by Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/liezxf/finally_a_remote_with_a_rechargeable_battery/"&gt;u/KingTut206 over on the Roku subreddit&lt;/a&gt; — offers a few extra features, including a “lost remote finder” option and hands-free voice controls. (So you’ll be able to say something like “Hey Roku, find my remote” and have it pinged.) It also features two customizable buttons, in addition to the four pre-programed ones for streaming services that have partnered with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DC2iDHiqdSxOEt_L79p8UiiEZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22305617/mmi5g7z8t2h61.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/liezxf/finally_a_remote_with_a_rechargeable_battery/" target="_blank"&gt;u/KingTut206&lt;/a&gt; / Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="milbtO"&gt;Unfortunately, the new remote charges via Micro-USB, not the more modern USB-C. It’s also not widely available right now: rather, the current release appears to be a limited early access test, with only 2,000 remotes being sold for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CHFEO"&gt;Hopefully, though, Roku will take the chance to upgrade the Voice Remote Pro before it launches more broadly. We’ve certainly got a few suggestions, if the company needs them: USB-C, wireless charging, and illuminated buttons are all good places to start. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after the latest update, Apple will fix it for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0foekY"&gt;Apple released watchOS 7.3.1 on Monday, and it could help fix an issue that prevents some Apple Watch Series 5 or SE smartwatches from charging while in the battery-saving Power Reserve Mode. But even the software update might not fix the issue, according to Apple. If it doesn’t, the company will repair your watch for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iziqA4"&gt;“A very small number of customers with Apple Watch Series 5 or Apple Watch SE models running watchOS 7.2 or 7.3 have experienced an issue with their watch not charging after it enters Power Reserve,” Apple says &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212180"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt;. If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after installing the update and after you put it on a charger for at least 30 minutes, the company asks that you contact Apple Support to set up a free mail-in repair. The company will have to inspect your watch to “verify that it’s eligible for free repair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMS6U2"&gt;The watchOS 7.3.1 update is available for download now. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe3Us7"&gt;Much of Texas has been hit by a historic winter cold front, leaving many &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/texas-power-grid-outages-rolling-blackouts-brownouts/10340431/"&gt;without power&lt;/a&gt; and affecting internet and cell phone services in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="M4stpY"&gt;Some internet providers have also said that customers may experience issues because of the difficult weather. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwBx1i"&gt;Nothing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;recently-launched startup&lt;/a&gt; from former OnePlus executive, Carl Pei, has acquired the Essential brand, according to a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003234098"&gt;filings at the UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;. Essential, of course, was the company started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google. It launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165040/essential-phone-review-android-andy-rubin"&gt;single smartphone&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shuttering its doors&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17004278/essential-phone-2017-sales-90k-units-sold-six-months-post-launch"&gt;poor sales performance&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing’s acquisition, which was completed on January 6th, 2021, ahead of Pei’s formal announcement of Nothing, apparently includes all of the trademarks, logo, and other branding of Essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAEZBC"&gt;It’s not clear what Pei’s new company plans to do with the Essential brand (or anything else for that matter; the information on what exactly Nothing’s product plans are is as scant as the company’s name itself), but as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, there isn’t much aside from the brand left at Essential, since the company closed its doors last year. Essential had planned to release a follow up to the one smartphone it did bring to market, as well as launch an ambitious new smart home platform, but neither of those ever made it out of planning phases and were obviously scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Essential Phone was the only product Essential brought to market before closing its doors in 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgEnw2"&gt;It’s also not clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly Nothing would want to acquire the Essential brand, which can best be described as “tarnished” after a failed product launch and association with Rubin’s name. A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;detailed allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Rubin during his time at Google and a massive $90 million buyout he received for leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peQk1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; article says that Nothing will reveal more information about its forthcoming products in the near future, so perhaps we’ll learn more about what it plans to do with the Essential brand sooner rather than later. We’ve reached out to Nothing for comment on the matter and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;
