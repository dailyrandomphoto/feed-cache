    <title>Some viewers of Metallica’s BlizzCon performance heard the least metal music imaginable </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmGgPnwIrkhXKRe832G_2QtQYUI=/215x0:2099x1256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848532/Screen_Shot_2021_02_20_at_12.02.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That disclaimer at the bottom would prove relevant.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi56ia"&gt;Despite its later-than-usual timing and going completely virtual for the first time, yesterday’s BlizzCon keynote brought with it some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;big news and exciting trailers&lt;/a&gt;. It also featured a musical performance from Metallica. The band isn’t new to BlizzCon, having first appeared at the conference in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYqIij"&gt;Viewers on many platforms (including Blizzard’s own Twitch and YouTube channels) heard a performance of Metallica’s 1984 tune “For Whom The Bell Tolls.” Several Twitch streamers broadcasting BlizzCon muted the feed during Metallica’s appearance to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;any potential DMCA troubles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDCJfy"&gt;But on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920716549"&gt;Twitch Gaming feed&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; carrying the stream, well, things took an amazing turn. Within seconds of the song beginning, the audio was replaced by what &lt;a href="https://music.avclub.com/twitch-censors-live-metallica-concert-with-dorkiest-mus-1846314134"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AV Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perfectly summed up as “the dorkiest, most &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;forest-ass music imaginable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8n16R2"&gt;The transition really makes the whole story here, so please watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zmU5Q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKhc21Y0Xdw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iO6BB1"&gt;It would seem the music performance rights that Blizzard obtained for its own channels didn’t extend to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271803/twitch-gaming-channel-exclusives-news"&gt;Twitch’s in-house gaming channel&lt;/a&gt;, so we were instead rewarded with this glorious moment. Could they have just cut the audio altogether? Sure, but that wouldn’t have been as fun. This version of the opening keynote stream currently has over 1.2 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vSihx"&gt;

&lt;p id="RnpnqH"&gt;If you want to see Metallica’s actual performance, it’s right at the 1:24:50 mark on either &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1AvJ0SRjw8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920697882"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. But me? I’m always going to remember it the Twitch Gaming way. The right way. &lt;/p&gt;

There’s a lot to chew on there with Napster and the contentious DMCA quagmires that regularly pop up today. But let’s leave that for another day. For now, just imagine Lars Ulrich and company actually jamming out to this RPG adventure music. It all syncs up nicely at times.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Postmates workers are getting scammed out of their earnings by phishing schemes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Plans To Return $10 Million Loan To U.S. After Uproar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENqQiHP-WMdzfhs-MP7qZOtX1QE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848016/1210482601.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoDRLL"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an alarming story about a rash of phishing scams that have been targeting gig workers for Postmates. Drivers are receiving phone calls from people claiming to be Postmates employees, who urge the workers to give over their login details — usually under the guise that it’s necessary to keep a driver account in good standing or avoid claims of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvD5PH"&gt;Once the scammers obtain that info, they switch the debit card information on the account — Postmates makes weekly deposits of a worker’s earnings, but instant transfers can also be requested — and then drain the balance of everything that’s in there. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to many Postmates gig workers who’ve been preyed upon with this scam, and others are using Reddit and social media to warn their fellow drivers about the phishing and social engineering attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIjAx"&gt;The unknown call usually comes in right after an order. (Placing an order allows the perpetrators to easily reach their Postmates driver by phone.) Some scammers have gone so far as to involve restaurants in their scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZvcmn"&gt;Drivers say that Postmates isn’t doing enough to make them aware of the phishing threat, which has only grown more common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scammers are taking advantage of how busy and hurried these gig workers often are, so drivers are asking for more safeguards in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oRCks"&gt;One suggestion is an automatic hold on a driver account whenever the deposit information changes, just to give some more time to prevent a worker’s money from being siphoned out. Another measure that could help would be a caller ID that clearly identifies when a call is coming from a Postmates customer account. Postmates has &lt;a href="https://support.postmates.com/fleet/articles/360022299432-article-How-can-I-keep-my-account-safe-"&gt;this support page&lt;/a&gt; on protecting accounts, but several drivers told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; they’d never seen it before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbPxXJ"&gt;Postmates says it has implemented two-factor authentication and can block cashouts if fraud is suspected. But drivers that’ve been hit by the scam say the company is hard to reach, so they have little hope for recouping their lost earnings. The whole story at &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; is worth a read — and yet more reason to tip well whenever you lean on the gig economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stretched vaccine timelines re-enter the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination process against COVID-19 begins in Colombia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FV_Ru2IicYlPOiV2Bj44VEwstDg=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847802/1231243754.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkFQQR"&gt;As the pandemic drags on, experts are exploring ways to stretch still-limited vaccine supplies to get as many people protected as possible. One idea that’s resurfaced this week involves allowing more time in between the first and second doses of the two-dose vaccines. This time, though, there’s some additional data that suggests it might work.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX0bZf"&gt;Here’s the idea: two leading vaccines, made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna require two doses. But their early data &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;showed pretty significant protection after the first dose&lt;/a&gt;. That got people thinking — is it worth giving more people partial protection with just one dose? Or should they stick to the schedule and fully vaccinate fewer people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="q5WGNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YTwEw"&gt;Back in December, some experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;encouraged researchers to set up trials&lt;/a&gt; to find out if a single dose of a two-dose vaccine would be effective. Around the same time, health authorities in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-delays-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-as-europe-ponders-how-to-speed-up-immunization-11609334172?mod=article_inline"&gt;decided to plow ahead &lt;/a&gt;without those studies, and prioritized getting first shots in arms, allowing people to delay their doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y66g6"&gt;This week, we got more data that shows that a single dose of Pfizer / BioNTech actually does a pretty good job of preventing illness. A study in Israel found that a first shot was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;85 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at reducing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXv0h"&gt;There are some caveats. Here’s a major one: most of the people in the study ended up getting their second dose relatively quickly. That means researchers can only say that the first dose is effective between 15 and 28 days after a person gets that first shot. How long protection lasts beyond that is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PGXTC"&gt;That’s why some experts are still urging caution when it comes to changing the schedule between those vaccines. “Until such time that there are good clinical trials that show that a single dose provides an equivalent level of protection, I don’t know that we should abandon our approach or create new policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;Jonathan Tempte told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQJmdS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/why-delaying-the-second-covid-vaccine-shot-is-messy-quicktake"&gt;It’s messy&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers don’t agree. Some, including Anthony Fauci maintain that sticking to two on-schedule doses can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/both-covid-vaccine-doses-critical-stay-ahead-variants-fauci-says-n1257041"&gt;help keep the US ahead of dangerous variants&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. Others lean towards taking a strategy more like the UK’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfAaFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VkmD68"&gt;“I think this [strategy] is something on which reasonable people could disagree, but saying you should only do something supported by randomized evidence when there’s an emergency would have precluded us from using masks, social distancing, from doing all the things we know are good public health practices,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/experts-tout-delaying-2nd-covid-vaccine-dose-us-deaths-mount"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. He added: “There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoUfc"&gt;Here in the US, states are trying to speed up doses — and looking to the federal government for guidance. The CDC has already said that in extreme circumstances, providers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"&gt;can stretch the window&lt;/a&gt; between their patients’ shots from three to four weeks up to six. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/cdc-advisers-weigh-guidance-for-delaying-second-covid-shots?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a committee that advises the CDC was considering whether or not to recommend changing the schedule in a smaller working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz7XOw"&gt;That discussion might not make it to the full committee any time soon. The working group might decide that they need to see more data, or it might not make it to the next COVID-19-related meeting in favor of discussing more pressing issues — including their recommendations for the single-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine. (Another meeting of that committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-02.pdf"&gt;is planned for this coming week&lt;/a&gt;, but its focus is on a host of other deadly diseases, including ebola, dengue, and rabies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKi80h"&gt;Even if the committee &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; take it up immediately, the question of when to administer doses is fascinating, and one we’ll be watching as the vaccine rollout accelerates, and more data just keeps pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um8S35"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;

But, buoyed by the possibility of being able to see their friends safely and, in the case of my son, upgrading his AirPods, they rolled up their sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yhi9ZX"&gt;It sounds crazy, right? Am I crazy? I definitely have that psychological battle where I start to doubt everything. Could it all be in my head? I’ll tell myself I need to try harder. I’ll force myself out of bed, but then I get in the shower and the hot water turns my hands purple. My heart rate spikes. I get so dizzy I have to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="KL46Ps"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nBh9TN"&gt;As my father’s health declined, I thought about how MAD the world is now; behind all the well-meaning gestures to honor frontline workers like him, there is the willingness to endanger their lives to keep commerce flowing. A willingness to destroy and be destroyed for a sense of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7CkJf"&gt;This is the first time in recent memory where several deals we’ve written about through the week are still available. It’s always great when readers have an extended window of time to snag a deal. So, below you’ll find a few of our favorite picks from the week, along with one new exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers. I won’t keep you in suspense, it’s on the Pixel 5. We worked with a partner to secure some refurbished units that are in great condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lVGfEG"&gt;Snag a refurbished Google Pixel 5 for under $600&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m04iWf"&gt;The lowest price for a like-new refurbished Pixel 5 on Amazon is $610, but you can save more with this reader-exclusive deal from Daily Steals. It’s offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a few options, actually. You can get either the unlocked or Verizon-locked phones in black or sage green (shown above). These units ship with a 90-day warranty and are in “Grade A” refurbished condition and may have minor scratches. They’ll ship with an aftermarket charger and cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l62FQI"&gt;One thing to note, if you’re wondering which to get: Verizon’s policy says it locks phones for 60 days after they’re purchased as new, then they automatically unlock. So, there’s a very high likelihood that the lock is no longer in effect on these refurbs, which would let you use the phone with any carrier. Daily Steals couldn’t confirm what their status is. But it’ll either arrived unlocked, or at worst, you’ll need to wait 60 days post-purchase. If you’re not happy with that solution, you can return the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oatmeal’s creator says his new game is a way to ‘play the comic’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comic-Con International 2014 - Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrlV92tZLzkZlnYs9emVkFrDbxQ=/0x73:2000x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847517/452705690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Knighton / WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00tbrs"&gt;The creator of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;, Matthew Inman, released a new cat-themed mobile word game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that feels like playing one of his silly comic strips. That feeling was intentional, Inman told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwvZN4"&gt;“My comics have always been rhetorical,” he said. “You don’t interact with the comic, you have no say in it, you’re just experiencing it. So, with [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], I got a chance to introduce some elements where people get to play the comic, and I thought that was a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtO5ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt; has a structure that Inman described as “&lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; combined with &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;.” Your goal is to beat your opponent by spelling words from a combination of letters at the bottom of your phone’s screen. When you spell a word, you’ll send a small army of cats up an invisible “lane” toward your opponent. Meanwhile, your opponent is sending armies of cats to try and defeat you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UFbbBu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbI4NA6K63I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6K8fD"&gt;The game was actually going to be multiplayer-only at first, Inman told me. This might be surprising for those who’ve played the game, since it has a robust story mode spanning 13 chapters. But that story mode was born from creating the game’s tutorial, said Inman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQDdsc"&gt;“I started drawing this tutorial on how to play, and then the tutorial became that single-player mode, where you have this neighbor that moves in and tells the whole story about him,” Inman said. But then, he realized, “I got in too deep. I had written all this stuff, I was like, ‘I have to end this,’ and I ended up writing like 12 chapters. But it became my favorite part of the whole thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99w4WH"&gt;Inman also discussed the game’s free-to-play model, which is very generous. Unlike many free-to-play games, &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player story mode and multiplayer are completely free, with no restrictions. The decision to offer all of that came from what Inman disliked about other free games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43BnPa"&gt;“I play free-to-play games, but I play them because I like the games,” Inman said. “The actual mechanics involved, like grinding and unlocking chests and getting gems and coins, I hate them. I fucking hate them. If [developers] were like, ‘pay us $20 and we’ll give you everything,’ I would do that. I much prefer that model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxNC8R"&gt;The game does offer paid cosmetics for multiplayer, but they don’t provide any gameplay benefit and they’re buried in a menu. And Inman says that revenue from them has been “pretty much non-existent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EfuEXM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Kitty Letter is a new mobile word game from the creator of The Oatmeal, and it’s good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n0IOEg"&gt;Inman acknowledged that he can offer the game largely for free because of his other successful ventures, which include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7927121/exploding-kittens-most-backed-kickstarter-project-ever"&gt;hugely successful card game Exploding Kittens&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m not just some altruistic guy that doesn’t want to make a living from his work,” he said. “To be completely candid, we make a great living from our card games, and we make a great living from some of the other things that I do. With [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], it felt like we could just get away with making it as enjoyable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTJ8Vt"&gt;“This app more generates that currency of — and this is so fucking corny — currency of love and joy, like you have a joyful experience with the game,” he said. “So, in turn, you love Exploding Kittens more, and maybe one day, if you want to buy a card game from us, you can.” It’s a business model similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;. Inman offers the comics for free online, but sells books and has offered merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="utkPUl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was cats from day one”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IBCcn6"&gt;Inman has a lot of ideas for what’s next for the game. He’d like to improve the arcade mode, add more single-player levels, and squash bugs. He’d also like to port the game to Steam and the Nintendo Switch, but those might be a little further away. “I would probably call it six months,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz63Ig"&gt;And I had to ask: were cats always the focus of the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUI9AQ"&gt;“It was cats from day one,” Inman said. “It was called &lt;em&gt;Cats Royale&lt;/em&gt;, originally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPYzum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztD67Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Furosystems Aventa e-bike review: ice breaker</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Ease your way into the joys of commuting by electric bike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4ZqxHI"&gt;Aventa is a new electric bike with a secret: its battery is removable despite the clean design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="ts5ZN1"&gt;London-based &lt;a href="https://www.furosystems.com/aventa/"&gt;Furosystems just launched the Aventa series of pedal-assist e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; into the European market. A more powerful US model is planned for later this year, or early in 2022 if the double whammy of Covid and Brexit creates undue complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBkg14"&gt;Aventa is sold in three variations, with the first deliveries starting in mid-March. Each model is priced to include all the accessories needed for typical urban commuting: mudguards, bell, luggage rack, kickstand, and front and rear lights. The standard Aventa ships with a 10.4Ah 375Wh battery, hydraulic disc brakes, and full-sized LCD display for €1,799. If you want more range, then you can opt for the Aventa Max, which costs €1,999 and has a bigger 14Ah 504Wh battery. The Aventa Pure is the entry-level model. It lowers the specs with mechanical disc brakes, a tiny 7.8Ah 281Wh battery, and a miniature LCD display. That also lowers the price to €1,599, which compares favorably to commuter e-bikes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €2,290) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,998), and city bikes like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199370/muto-review-electric-bike-price-features"&gt;Muto&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pCXUZ"&gt;It’s the entry-level Aventa Pure model I’ve been testing for the past month in frozen Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVlWktzN--y2yZj5xZO3WIdFwRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313151/aventa_pure_on_ice.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;First canal freeze in years, so why not?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="h5jJ0r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10349823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BN399E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always on the hunt for affordable and attractive electric commuter bikes. But they need to be from reputable companies. After all, if you’re going to spend a couple of grand on an e-bike meant for daily use then it had better be reliable and serviceable for years to come, not sold by some fly-by-night operator on Amazon or Indiegogo that’ll go bust just as soon as you need to make a warranty claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ZqE7"&gt;Furosystems appears to be a company with staying power. It recently raised £750,000 (about $1 million) from investors ahead of the Aventa launch. That’s pennies compared to the recent funding rounds by Rad Power Bikes ($150 million), VanMoof ($40 million), Cowboy ($26 million), and Super73 ($20 million), but CEO Eliott Wertheimer tells me that the company was already profitable before the November funding round. In addition to the new Aventa e-bikes, Furosystems already sells Fuze scooters and the Furo X folding e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvviFj"&gt;Last year Furosystems did 60 percent of its sales in the UK, according to Wertheimer, with the remaining 40 percent split across France and Italy. This year the company is planning to grow sales from about 3,000 units to 10,000 by expanding into Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Aventa e-bikes are being assembled in Portugal with components sourced from around the world. Wertheimer tells me that his ultimate goal is to design and manufacture every part themselves, but to do that now would be too costly. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2Yquut9XkTXTbv5r0aX3InExdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313097/verge_DSC_3377_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery, inserted backward, but you get the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFvMqb"&gt;The Aventa Pure e-bike I’ve been testing is built for European roads. That means a motor with 250W of continuous power (and 500W peak) and a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). That speed is fine in congested city centers, but too slow for anyone commuting along lonely roads or protected rural bike paths for any great distance. Mind you, that’s criticism of European transportation policy, not the Aventa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlrS_QkJEO1sFDYL9lQackK_KRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313074/verge_40kmph_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 25 km/h speed limit can be overridden for markets that allow it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYP9TQ"&gt;Furosystems does provide instructions to override the speed limit “to comply with local regulations,” requiring just a few taps on the buttons surrounding the LCD display. With that tweak the Aventa will reach a top speed of between 32 km/h and 36 km/h depending upon the rider’s size, I’m reliably told. But I was a good boy for this review. While I confirmed the speed hack was legit (and thrilling), I stayed within the European limits for my testing now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558235/vanmoof-slows-s3-x3-europe-japan-speed-limit"&gt;police are increasingly cracking down&lt;/a&gt; on illegally fast e-bikes in cities throughout Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ityn1W"&gt;Furosystems says that the Aventa Pure’s 281Wh battery is capable of more than 40 km (25 miles) of range. In my testing, on long stretches of uninterrupted rural roads, I’ve already gone well beyond that estimate since I’m often pedaling at speeds greater than 25 km/h. At those speeds the motor is just idling as it’s not needed to supply power to the pedals. As a result, my battery says it’s still more than 50 percent full after 47 km (29.7 miles) of riding, despite riding at the max of five pedal-assisted levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYpFyp"&gt;Although the Aventa lacks any kind of throttle or boost button, the sturdy little Bafang motor fitted to the rear wheel hub was able to flatten the steepest hills I could find (which aren’t anywhere close to San Francisco steep) thanks to its ability to generate 500W of peak power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uO0s4G"&gt;When riding in stop-and-go traffic, power is provided smoothly and evenly to each downstroke of the pedals despite the lack of any torque sensor like you’ll find on more expensive e-bikes. On flat surfaces, I barely used the nine speeds allowed by the Shimano Altus derailleur. But those gears definitely came in handy when trying to start under heavy loads on inclines or when getting some exercise at top speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9VVwq"&gt;The Aventa puts the rider into a somewhat sporty forward lean on a saddle you’ll want to replace if regularly riding long bumpy distances. The ride is almost silent, disrupted only by a thin rattle when riding over some of the bumpiest brick roads I could find. While I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact source of the rattle, it did go away when I rode without the battery installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnNvKS"&gt;Removing the battery is an easy, but awkward, procedure as it’s locked into place by a key at the base of the downtube. To extract it the bike has to be laid unceremoniously onto the ground. You can also flip the bike upside down, but at 16.5 kg (36 pounds), the Aventa may be relatively lightweight for a fully loaded e-bike, but it’s definitely not light. Nevertheless, being able to remove the battery for indoor charging is a necessity for many city dwellers who don’t have the space, or strength, to lug a hulking e-bike up narrow stairs to an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLrtNmoZcBNYH2D-Xa2VMcrFQlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314436/verge_Aventa_promise_vs_reality_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top image with better cable management is what buyers today will receive in mid-March, compared to the review bike which was sold in December and January. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhJafd"&gt;Now, about the cable management. The Aventa Pure e-bike sent for review has far too many exposed cables and connectors for my liking. Fortunately, that’s being fixed for anyone preordering an Aventa today, as the bikes being manufactured now for delivery starting mid-March will route the cables through the frame. While integrated cabling certainly looks better, the exposed cables and connectors on my review bike make it more modular and therefore easier to service whenever a part needs replacing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76frC6"&gt;My review unit arrived with a smashed headlight, for example, caused by a clumsy courier. Furosystems sent me a new assembly which I was able to install myself by releasing a pair of screws and unclipping the damaged unit. It took all of two minutes. Ease of repair is an important consideration for a young direct-to-consumer company that lacks a sophisticated global repair network. Shipping a busted e-bike to a foreign country for service is no fun for anyone, least of all the owner. Just ask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;early adopters of the VanMoof S3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHm00L"&gt;Wertheimer tells me that Furosystems is constantly iterating and taking on customer feedback, and is willing to switch back to the external cabling if customer surveys suggest a strong preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w1bnuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10349799"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRbrM5"&gt;Other notable specs and observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gfT0hm"&gt;Charges in about 4.5 hours, or as long as 7 hours if you buy the Aventa Max with higher-capacity battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xlg9cZ"&gt;The aluminum frame can fit riders between 165 cm (5 feet 4 inches) and 195 cm (6 feet 4 inches) and up to 120 kg (265 pounds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gmVuhT"&gt;The lighting kit on the Aventa Pure features an integrated front light that can be controlled from the display pad (which also controls the LCD’s backlight). The rear clamp-on lamp has to be operated manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AlTndH"&gt;The mini LCD display is fine for showing battery level, speed in km/h or mph, and distance traveled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QWfYWf"&gt;There isn’t Bluetooth or an app, which is fine by me — the Aventa is powered on via a button below the LCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cfthPB"&gt;I hate the giant logo printed on the downtube. I get it, the company is young and needs to build recognition, but it comes at the expense of the buyer who’s transformed into a rolling billboard for a brand without any prestige (yet). One bystander asked me if I got it from some bike-sharing startup. Ugh, the humiliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k3dHuV"&gt;The battery can be inserted backward accidentally. It really should be keyed to make insertion idiot-proof (hi, I’m an idiot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6aiEaZ"&gt;The quick-release front-wheel and saddle stem are convenient but also magnets for thieves. Be careful out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmSl-ioR-8DY-hamKeIyVjlGvQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313044/verge_DSC_2901_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIrB5j"&gt;The entry-level Aventa Pure is a lot of bike for the price, coming in at €400 less than the VanMoof S3, which has become a benchmark of sorts for commuter e-bikes. The Aventa Pure also has a removable battery unlike the S3, and that might make all the difference for many buyers. True, the Aventa Pure doesn’t have all the gee-whiz features you’ll find on premium e-bikes at €2,000 and above. But expensive features like integrated security, theft recovery, at-home servicing, crash detection, and apps that can recommend the least polluted bike routes are ultimately just nice-to-haves, not critical functions of an electric bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtS64Y"&gt;The Furosystems Aventa Pure is an attractive, inexpensive, and bare-bones e-bike for commuters. It will get you from A to B and back safely and reliably, and likely well into the future. And honestly, what more do you need? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="loh3kM"&gt;The Aventa Pure is a great icebreaker for anyone wanting an introduction to e-bike commuting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim is Steam’s hottest new PC game, and it’s now sold 3 million copies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday February 19th, two days after we originally published this post, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;it hit 3 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlvYZS"&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="an0GTw"&gt;By Friday, it took the #9 spot with 410,000 players, pulling &lt;em&gt;Postal &lt;/em&gt;down one rung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJXT0NhkWQgCA4_iJaYyaP3x5AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309223/steam_top_sellers_lunar_new_year.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot taken February 15th, the last day of the Steam sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3l7Vk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 19th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim has now sold 3 million copies and is now has a new record for the ninth-most simultaneous players at any one moment on Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned how the Daft Punk robot helmets were created</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9_Dpvk7pmX8UtjpmWkuB8lnZuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845901/acastro_210219_4434_daftPunk_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Images by Daft Punk, Alex and Martin, and Alterian Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CxncBL"&gt;As a visual artist who also makes beats in the anonymity of my bedroom, I’ve always wondered how Daft Punk managed to craft not only their music, but their visual presence. A masterpiece unto itself, the Daft Punk helmets transform two anonymous musicians into otherworldly beings. Arbiters of funk and electro. Ambassadors of sound. Gods of the synthesizer. You get it. The helmets allow the musicians to detach themselves from reality and bring the audience into their universe. It leaves the musician in mystery, and until today, the genesis of the helmets was a mystery to me too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbaORk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daft_Wub/status/1362285526435340288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1362285526435340288%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;In a tweet thread by @daft_wub&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the whole process from sketch to final, including electrical schematics and initial sculpts of the helmets. They also show the complex wiring that was required to power the matrix of LEDs, as well as behind-the-scenes images from Daft Punk’s very first photo shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P4xuzf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The creation of the original Daft Punk robots. A thread. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Byuo6yjic2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Byuo6yjic2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daft Punk Fandom   (@Daft_Wub) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daft_Wub/status/1362285526435340288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="flEgXj"&gt;The thread also credits the companies involved: Alterian Inc., which did work on the first version of the helmets, and Ironhead Studios, which worked on the latest and slimmest versions of our favorite funk bots. Both studios have experience in film; Ironhead Studios in particular has worked with Marvel on live-action costumes for characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Thanos, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6sIiG8"&gt;These images aren’t new; the tweet thread is simply recirculating them, but this is great for fans like me who’ve never really seen the process. If you want to learn more, I suggest reading &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnyekw/daft-punk-birth-of-robots"&gt;this article by Piers Martin&lt;/a&gt;, based on an extensive 2000 interview of the duo originally conducted for &lt;em&gt;The Face&lt;/em&gt;. You can even read a full annotated transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NN2IXs"&gt;And for bonus material, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtjucCWeOf4&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt; with Alterian SFX Designer Tony Gardner exploring various iterations of the suits. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hZCJrv"&gt;Blizzcon happened a little later than usual due to the pandemic, but the first virtual version of Blizzard’s games convention still had some interesting news and trailers. The opening keynote covered most of the big franchises, like &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, along with some more obscure classics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bXQ35"&gt;If you missed the event, you can catch up on all of the biggest news right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="I0LOZz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291771/blizzard-arcade-collection-announced-blizzcon-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E6sHSD"&gt;The first announcement was one of the most unexpected: three of Blizzard’s more obscure games are being bundled into a new package called the &lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lost Vikings, Rock &amp;amp; Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne &lt;/em&gt;have all been ported to modern platforms, including PC, Xbox One, PS4, and the Nintendo Switch. And they include some handy features, like save states and a virtual museum. The best part? The collection is out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ6PH9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LvrLZ4yETHI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6MIdJz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285611/diablo-4-blizzcon-2021-trailer-rogue-class"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4yCsWV"&gt;Diablo IV is still some ways away — Blizzard has already said it won’t be launching this year — but we at least got a glimpse of what to expect thanks to a new trailer that unveiled the rogue class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhXmOu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRP62MGOrUo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="My83ua"&gt;If you prefer an older-style of demonic dungeon crawling, Blizzard also officially unveiled &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;, an HD remaster of the nearly two decade-old game. It’s coming out this year for both PC and console, with versions for the Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’ll even include cross-progression between console and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUqsDY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLDvM5IDyL8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1j7Jfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hn1KPO"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft Classic&lt;/em&gt; players, Blizzard revealed that the game’s next big adventure will be the “Burning Crusade.” There’s no word on when exactly it’ll launch, but Blizzard says “the Dark Portal reopens 2021.” For the main game, there’s also a new chapter for the &lt;em&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/em&gt; expansion on the way, called “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1362889402612133891"&gt;Chains of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aFPou7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRj-GotnNaQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VzzgEs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bKSpq9"&gt;During a presentation after the main keynote, Blizzard unveiled some new information about &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;. There are two new maps, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902203875303427"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902483081719808"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, weather effects like &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362905194460106754"&gt;sandstorms and snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906847770906625"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362907402790608898"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906606124503040"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362908431691116547"&gt;redesigned looks&lt;/a&gt; for Widowmaker, Reaper, McCree, and Pharah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQyHFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 6:56PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;em&gt; announcements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo II is getting remastered for console and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAYTtt9jYFghX2H6VERDG2jGZZ4=/145x0:1767x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845709/screenshot__170_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7HhRi5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big overhaul in a new remaster. After &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/25/22248563/diablo-2-remake-release-dates-pc-blizzard-vicarious-visions-activision-report"&gt;a few leaks&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt; at its online-only edition of Blizzcon 2021. The new version of the game — which first launched back in 2000 — will launch this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, with cross-progression between PC and console. The HD remaster will include both the base game and its expansion, &lt;em&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R1N5Dr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;                              &lt;br&gt;          Arise,                        &lt;br&gt;               Diablo,     &lt;br&gt;   Lord         &lt;br&gt;                of              &lt;br&gt;                      Terror.&lt;br&gt;                   &lt;br&gt;                             &lt;br&gt;                       &lt;a href="https://t.co/76kxCCMv51"&gt;pic.twitter.com/76kxCCMv51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Diablo (@Diablo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1362896494622294017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNiclb"&gt;The announcement comes at a surprisingly busy time for the long running action-RPG series. In addition to the remaster of &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;, Blizzard is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the next full-fledged title, &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySwr6n"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is too modern for your tastes, the original game is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254558/diablo-classic-digital-gog-blizzard-windows-10-purchase"&gt;still available on GOG.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
