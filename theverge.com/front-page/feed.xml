    <title>Samsung releases eco-friendly watchbands made from apple peel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S-pF5elMiyiQ9c3FJHBTh94xLE=/0x0:6582x4388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839279/IMG_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for the watchbands start at $39.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="632uJc"&gt;Samsung has announced six limited edition watch bands for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; made of recyclable and eco-friendly materials including apple peel. The range was made in collaboration with Sami Miró, a fashion designer whose previous collections have made use of upcycled materials. The bands are available today, with prices starting at $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sik6nf"&gt;There are six designs included in the collection. The “Midnight Black” and “Stratus Sky” bands are made out of 100 percent apple peel skin “recovered from the fruit industry.” Samsung claims the material has the “premium look of leather” while obviously not being sourced from animals. The other four designs (“Aurora Night,” “Cloud Navy,” “Earth Sunrise,” and “Dawn Atlas”) are made of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material which Samsung says is recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WBwZAq4o8c9r-a9QDIyYDr9hyqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839353/SamsungxSami_WatchBands_01.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, first row: Aurora Night, Earth Sunrise, Midnight Black. Second row: Cloud Navy, Dawn Atlas, Stratus Sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="roqZ3X"&gt;Alongside the watch bands Samsung is also releasing a collection of three complementary free watch faces available for download from the Google Play store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNXPJa"&gt;Yes, the most sustainable choice will always be to use the watch band that came with your smartwatch, but if you’re going to buy an aftermarket watchband it’s nice to know some effort’s been made to reduce its environmental footprint. Personally I hope that Samsung’s future smartwatches might use these materials as standard, rather than only in optional accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctLqMW"&gt;Samsung already uses sustainable materials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/27/18199663/samsung-sustainable-materials-packaging-bioplastic-recycled-plastic"&gt;in its packaging&lt;/a&gt;, and as of last year its sites across the US, China, and Europe were powered by &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/sustainable-practices-samsungs-eco-friendly-efforts-towards-a-better-tomorrow"&gt;100 percent renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; (that’s not the case for all regions, &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/blog/6690/itindustry-climate-samsung-report/"&gt;like Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but Samsung says it’s working on it). But, it still has a lot of work to do to reduce the environmental impact of its devices themselves, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F52399%2Fgalaxy-z-flip-fold-3-small-changes-make-a-big-difference&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666328%2Fsamsung-eco-friendly-sustainable-limited-edition-galaxy-watch-4-bands" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;particularly when it comes to repairability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons museum exhibit finds the personal amid the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQ5yR5VAu0B7fgKm8oJkoaOXkpk=/186x0:1266x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839181/E_WViAAXMAIgfrI.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The National Videogame Museum explores the game’s impact by listening to players&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EmpRsY"&gt;Fueled by pandemic restrictions, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; became a destination for major events during 2020 and 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-fast-becoming-a-new-way-for-hong-kong-protesters-to-fight-for-democracy"&gt;Protests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409727/biden-harris-animal-crossing-campaign-new-horizons-yard-signs-election"&gt;political campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1avhBZoS48I&amp;amp;ab_channel=GaryWhitta"&gt;celebrity talk shows&lt;/a&gt; happened alongside the game’s own seasonal events. But when putting together its exhibition on the stories of &lt;em&gt;New Horizon&lt;/em&gt; players, the National Videogame Museum found that people were sharing things that were much more personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lmyJW"&gt;“[We were] half expecting that a lot of the submissions would be people responding to [major] events in their own way, but we found that people were marching to their own drumbeat,” says marketing and communications director Conor Clarke. “They’re not just personal [stories] in that they’re personal responses to outside events, but they’re making … the events themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKXTve"&gt;The Museum opened their call for entries in December, closing them a few months later so that they could capture a record of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22321111/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-archive-one-year-anniversary"&gt;game’s first year&lt;/a&gt;. “It really all started with that perfect storm of the game being released coincidentally at the moment at which many countries either went into lockdown or adopted social distancing measures,” says Claire Mead, program and collections manager. “The whole idea behind this project is being able to collect these stories and really focus not so much on the game itself, but the way in which different players have been able to shape their experience of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sitbNx"&gt;The exhibition, titled the &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Diaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, launched September 2nd. Building it up from the submitted stories, Mead found that where people weren’t talking about brands or organizations using the game, they were focused on things they were building themselves, or with their communities. “Somebody putting on an exhibition in a house that they’ve purpose-built as their own gallery, or somebody creating a Halloween event for the whole neighborhood and actually learning how to play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; because the neighborhood kids were playing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8jXPVv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-one-year-anniversary-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EnxKDhHNSvFAbmrmlqq_hNm8n7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836991/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_02_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obXStj"&gt;Sometimes these events were linked to things in the outside world. But the museum’s timeline of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; stories is also filled with people trying to inject a bit of novelty into the monotony of pandemic life. Mead mentions Nintendo South Wales (fans who are unaffiliated with the company) who created a “shutterbug off” event using the game’s photography mechanics and abundance of nature. “[That was] based on a member of the group saying that they really missed just going out in the group in nature with people and trying to reconnect with nature even in lockdown,” she says. The &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/shutterbug-off/"&gt;exhibition page&lt;/a&gt; for the event includes a video that shows off many of the photos taken by the club’s members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CV9mZH"&gt;As well as using a timeline of the game’s first year to highlight moments like these, the website offers a “random” button for diving into more of the diaries. But to allow (virtual) exhibition attendees to explore in a more structured way, the museum’s curatorial team found that entries fit into several broad categories: keeping a routine, making your space, representing yourself, sharing creativity, and staying in touch. By browsing in each, it’s possible to get a real sense for the many different ways people have experienced the game. For example, the shutterbug-off falls under sharing creativity, as does everything from using the built-in &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/stitching-in-pixels/"&gt;fashion designing&lt;/a&gt; mechanics to using the game to create &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/poems/"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/podcast/"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="1zHcVF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When building the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossingDiaries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossingDiaries&lt;/a&gt;, we were blown away by the amount of awesome videos people sent through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From island tours, to short films, to so much more. The creativity on show is awe inspiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a short selection of some of those videos: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qu9uNiNyLi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qu9uNiNyLi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The National Videogame Museum (@nvmuk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nvmuk/status/1435873778316234752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ3KVV"&gt;The themes are also designed to make the exhibition understandable for people who may not have played &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, or who may not play games at all. “Keeping a routine [or] staying in touch, and trying to create your own controlled predictable safe environment during an uncertain time are just universal experiences that we’ve all felt in the past year,” says Mead. “So for us it was really about also getting people who do not play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; to approach those themes and understand how the game helped with that. And challenge their assumptions a bit more about what a game even is in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyrg0Y"&gt;Though the exhibition focuses on players’ experiences of the first year of the game, it remains open to submissions for potential future showcases. Mead has several potential avenues that she says she would be interested in exploring, like inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycZqNc"&gt;“There’s been lots of really interesting conversations around skin tone in the game … as well as gender inclusion and just having gender neutral options in the English version,” she says. But there are also topics she would like to see the museum explore critically, like the presence of brands and political parties in the game, or its reflection of colonialism. “[There’s] the whole optics of arriving on a deserted island or going to other islands and completely ransacking them for resources. That was definitely a case of understanding that that is a huge subject in itself that needs proper consultation and just proper creative collaboration to explore. So I think honestly the sky’s the limit in terms of where &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Diaries&lt;/em&gt; could go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gK_kc_qAjkgVFq3pEDPQsZg8DgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837010/Switch_ACNH_ND0220_screen_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zU7x5s"&gt;Though the pandemic isn’t over, there is certainly a sense that things are very different than they were in &lt;em&gt;New Horizon&lt;/em&gt;’s first year. “I think it will be very interesting, actually, to see how people’s experience of the game might evolve and shift,” says Mead. But even with fewer worldwide lockdowns, the stories the museum has curated have demonstrated that the game will continue to be a place of respite and enjoyment for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSGqFm"&gt;Clarke refers to &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/m-e-and-my-island/"&gt;an entry&lt;/a&gt; by Lisa Walker, who was diagnosed with the chronic health condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E., also sometimes known as chronic fatigue syndrome) in 2019. She writes about many of the themes that emerged in others’ stories: the outdoor escape, creating a daily routine, and being able to participate in events like New Year’s from home. But she’s also aware that as lockdowns ease, she won’t be one of the people completely swapping out their &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; life for physical adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg1JuQ"&gt;“I hope the Covid-19 pandemic will be more under control; so that people can return to their lives and the lockdowns will ease,” reads the diary entry. “I imagine some of the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; islands will end up deserted again; but, as one of the many people living with M.E., my island life will certainly continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VQiRkw"&gt;For Clarke, this highlighted the potential for continuing to gather stories even as &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; becomes decoupled from pandemic life. “The stories we’re collecting are way more universal than that. When you read [something] like that you’re like, ‘Yeah, we’ve gotta keep collecting.’”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is now available for the lowest price yet in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVt8BXx7RQzj8cl9pq1P2rxEWX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839164/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bblCn7"&gt;The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has long been considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market, especially if you’re already tapped into Amazon’s ecosystem. The arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; may complicate things next month, however, if you couldn’t care less about Wi-Fi 6 and improved processing power, the current model should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I94XLn"&gt;As far as specs go, the last-gen Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K checks all the boxes. The 4K streamer offers everything HDR (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10), as well as Dolby Atmos sound, access to all major streaming apps, and an Alexa-enabled remote that lets you issue commands without having to shout across your living room. Normally $50, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is now on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $35&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the lowest price we’ve seen on the budget-friendly streaming device to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqNBJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10710076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjvmu8"&gt;The school year may have already begun, but if you’re still in need of a competent laptop with fantastic battery life, Apple’s M1-equipped MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is back down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$850 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. Our team thinks the 2020 Air is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, with lightning-fast performance, a tried-and-true clamshell design, and a battery that allows for a full day of work or play before it needs to be recharged via USB-C. Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, September 14th, might bring a few MacBook surprises — potentially even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; — but, in the meantime, the latest model should be more than enough for most people. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="riZ5tC"&gt;The original HomePod may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;met its demise earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but the HomePod Mini lives on. And if you’re looking to pick up Apple’s scaled-down smart speaker in lieu of an Amazon or Google device, Best Buy is currently offering the Siri-equipped HomePod Mini alongside a Philips Hue Lightstrip Plus Starter Kit for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfx5Ky0zA6i#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy $30 off the bundle’s list price. The starter kit — which includes a power adapter and a Philips Hue Bridge — is also compatible with the HomePod Mini, meaning not only can it use Apple’s compact speaker to play music and answer questions, but it can control your lighting via HomeKit. Like all products in the current Philips Hue lineup, the flexible light strip can showcase an array of 16 million colors, ensuring you can always find one that strikes your mood. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our HomePod Mini review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YXnnJC"&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393879/polaroid-go-instant-camera-tiny-selfie-timer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Polaroid Go&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, instant cameras are far from over. And while Fujifilm might not have been in the game for quite as long as Polaroid, Fujifilm’s current Instax lineup offers a heavy dose of old-school nostalgia at a more affordable price point. Typically $88, you can pick up the Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TGOWK3Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon today with delayed shipping for $75&lt;/a&gt;, the second-steepest discount it has received since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xDf7F"&gt;Film-wise, the battery-powered instant camera uses a larger Instax Wide film that’s about twice the size of a credit card. That means you can use it for various types of photography, whether it be fashion, landscape, or portraiture. Other noteworthy features include a tripod socket, an image finder, and a dial that allows you to better adjust the focus. It’s not as portable as some of the competition, but if you’re looking for a simple instant camera that’s cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Instant-Camera-16670522/dp/B08G5YV1Q6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm’s newer Instax Square SQ1&lt;/a&gt;, the Instax Wide 300 is a solid contender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTlR3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHNDq4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eXriQ5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHxZDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sets new water goals as droughts worsen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NETHERLANDS-TECHNOLOGY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ZI6bpDDmvs4E7MpkX6x_2cG5Dc=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839116/628050484.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AKB3I"&gt;With drought sucking the Western US dry, Google announced new plans to protect vital water resources. Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West. To offset its thirst, the company said that by 2030, it wants to replenish 120 percent of the water it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JotJgA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google guzzles up water to cool its data centers, three of which are in the drought-stricken West&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g9C9in"&gt;Google laid out three strategies to accomplish that goal: using water more efficiently in its operations, partnering with communities to make watersheds healthier, and offering its technologies as tools to predict and prevent water stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svlgc9"&gt;The company has faced &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-01/how-much-water-do-google-data-centers-use-billions-of-gallons?sref=7mwUMHq1"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from communities near its data center in South Carolina and a new one to be built in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. Residents there were worried that Google would burn through too much of their water. Arizona farmers are already facing deep water cuts because of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;historically awful drought&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbbws9"&gt;If Google succeeds in replenishing more water than it uses, it will become “water positive.” It’s the latest trend in environmental pledges from companies including Facebook and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrYjTz"&gt;They’re all in a race with climate change, which is intensifying droughts in already parched places like California, Arizona, and Nevada. Ninety-five percent of Nevada, where Google has two data centers, is in a “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. And “severe” drought plagues more than 93 percent of California, home to Google’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWfm38"&gt;“I grew up in Muir Beach, California, and was fortunate to spend my childhood exploring its beautiful forests and streams. Today, these delicate ecosystems are threatened as the entire west coast of the U.S. is experiencing one of the worst droughts in recorded history,” Google chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/replenishing-water/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwZZwY"&gt;Google’s water withdrawal — for data centers and its other operations — more than doubled from 2.5 to 5 billion gallons of water from 2016 to 2019, according to its most recent sustainability report. Over that time, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223641/google-facility-expansion-data-centers-offices-america-investment"&gt;invested more heavily in data centers&lt;/a&gt; behind its search engine, cloud computing, and YouTube. It now has some two dozen data centers scattered across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BR0hZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a delicate balancing act when it comes to managing energy and water use &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IPVtsF"&gt;There’s a delicate balancing act when it comes to managing energy and water use at its data centers. Using water to cool servers uses up less electricity than blasting them with air conditioning. Since Google has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436228/google-climate-change-pledge-2030-renewable-energy"&gt;pledged to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll have to cut down on its electricity use to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. But the company will now need to make sure it’s not using up too much water, either. To minimize how much water it needs for its data centers, Google recirculates the water through its cooling systems. It has also tried using seawater and reclaimed wastewater to do the job at some locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ0N5i"&gt;To “replenish” more water than it uses, Google plans to invest in projects that restore or conserve resources in watersheds where it operates. A watershed is an area where water drains into a shared body like a river or lake. Initiatives that Google might support moving forward could include restoring wetlands and forests, or harvesting rainwater. To have the greatest impact, Google will need to focus efforts in watersheds that are struggling the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzXBJL"&gt;Google is also working with environmental and research groups to develop a new app called Global Water Watch. It’s supposed to eventually provide “&lt;a href="https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/deltares-wwf-and-wri-team-up-to-develop-global-water-watch-a-platform-funded-by-google-org-to-provide-worldwide-access-to-water-information/"&gt;world-wide, high-resolution, near-real-time&lt;/a&gt;” water data to help communities better manage their resources. Google will continue to fund other water and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conservation projects, it said in yesterday’s announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UcDU5w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How do we understand what is real action versus window dressing?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zyBjx9"&gt;Keeping Google and other companies accountable for the promises they make will be the last piece of the puzzle. It’s critical that these companies disclose the progress they make toward their goals, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/questions-trail-big-business-water-positive-pledges/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported in August. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-021-00101-w"&gt;Less than a third&lt;/a&gt; of data center operators measure how much water they consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIkbin"&gt;“That is sort of the ultimate question in this space: How do we understand what is real action versus window dressing?” Simon Fischweicher, the head of corporations and supply chains at CDP North America, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to measure their environmental impact, said to &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uM7zZp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3U7MdyLIpYSaVzSMTTKwHi5EUq0=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838947/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice assistant, augmented reality, and translation features. All this is build into an “optimized operating system based on Android,” which appears to bear some relation to Android Go, if &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/#:~:text=the%20google%20camera%20go%20app%20icon%20spotted%20in%20one%20of%20the%20promotional%20images%20leads%20us%20to%20believe%20that%20it%20might%20feature%20android%20go"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFYo2f"&gt;Work on the phone was first announced in 2020, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google announced a $4.5 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in Jio. As part of the collaboration, Reliance announced earlier this year that it’s shifting its retail business onto Google’s cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5QZah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers are seen leaving the Chinese multinational..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU_JsUcuMu9inFyT4qdB0knyVvo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838893/1235139501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnqpRS"&gt;A common reaction I see to this kind of fast charger is that they’ll surely have a negative impact on battery longevity, or that there must be safety issues, or both. So I talked to Daniel Desjarlais, international head of communications and global spokesperson at Xiaomi, about the company’s fast-charging technology efforts and what people outside China should expect from the 11T Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mc9AEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1o9h5"&gt;First off, how does it work? “It’s like having two different inlets to fill the gas in your car and two separate tanks,” Desjarlais says of Xiaomi’s dual-cell battery design, which is similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/8/20954678/oppo-reno-ace-super-vooc-fast-charging-review"&gt;other high-powered fast-charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; work. “Now, rather than filling at a certain slow rate on one side, you can fill up two at the same time. This is all done on the side of the phone, the charger outputs 120 watts and rather than trying to push the maximum of five volts, a single channel splits it into two, three, four channels. This allows us to increase everything — everything is done at 20 amperes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ybnUo"&gt;Desjarlais went on in detail to explain what happens with the technology in the battery itself, and how Xiaomi’s thermal monitoring systems work to maintain the optimum charging speed at each point in the cycle, but as a non-engineer I’m frankly not qualified to comment on the electrical design here. What I am qualified to comment on is phone design and consumer expectations, and I know a lot of people do worry about the tradeoffs with these fast-charging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAuClI"&gt;On the question of longevity, Desjarlais says you can expect endurance in line with other more conventional phones. “This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested,” he says. “Generally, for this level of charging with the batteries that we’ve tested it with, after 800 charging cycles you’ll still have 80 percent battery health. Now, that 20 percent might sound like ‘oh wow, I’m losing 20 percent,’ but that’s quite standard across basically all charging tech. 800 cycles, for most people, it’s going to be two years roughly. So that’s quite solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lb8nZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We don't just want to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChargeBetter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ChargeBetter&lt;/a&gt;, but we also want to make sure it's safe for our users. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiaomiHyperCharge?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XiaomiHyperCharge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9AyMy3Jjzg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9AyMy3Jjzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1433716399738925061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIOxPN"&gt;For comparison, Apple — a company that has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;heavy scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; over its long-term battery performance while offering slower charging tech than most of its competitors — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;tells customers&lt;/a&gt; to expect a lithium-ion battery to retain “up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.” If Xiaomi’s testing figures are accurate, a phone like the 11T Pro shouldn’t suffer from an unusually short lifespan, even if its owner only ever uses the fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xADjjO"&gt;When I ask whether using slower chargers would improve battery health further, Desjarlais says “There’s relatively minute differences between the two. Of course, the optimal situation would be yes, to use the slower charger if you’re going to charge overnight and use the fast charger for more rushed situations.” But Xiaomi’s testing has been carried out with the presumption that you could get good battery health if you use fast charging all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SExidK"&gt;As for safety, Desjarlais says the testing has been extremely thorough and includes third parties, with 34 different battery protection features included in the device itself. “Generally this is part of the reason why this technology is coming out now for global markets,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that we met all the regulations, but also that it was incredibly safe for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql77da"&gt;Still, I wondered about those potential tradeoffs. Are there really no downsides to a charging system like this? Could a phone with more conventional charging be thinner, or house a bigger battery, for example? According to Desjarlais, there’s no negative impact. That said, the actual charger is quite a bit larger than the average phone pack-in, and will of course draw more power (albeit for shorter periods of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jatb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us for the global launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TPro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TPro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TSeries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TSeries&lt;/a&gt; and more products on Sep 15, 2021 at 20:00 (GMT+8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the magic begin! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cinemagic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cinemagic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ade9PECzWP"&gt;https://t.co/ade9PECzWP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1436252424390406149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jk4AVJ"&gt;Xiaomi thinks its fast-charging technology is here to stay, and there still could be room for improvement. Earlier this year, for example, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22461435/xiaomi-fast-charging-world-record-200w-wired-120w-wireless"&gt;demonstrated a prototype 200W system&lt;/a&gt; that filled a 4,000mAh battery in 8 minutes, though Desjarlais would only say that “Whether or not this comes [in a commercial product] is something that you’re going to have to wait and see on,” citing the need for further safety and performance testing. He had much the same answer about Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;truly wireless Air Charge&lt;/a&gt; teaser, saying “It’s a wonderful concept and it’s something that we’re continuing to examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o07nD"&gt;Obviously, safety and effective performance should be the least you expect out of any given phone feature. With fast charging, the question is whether customers in Xiaomi’s global markets will consider it a selling point. “For us, I think the big goal here is there’s a lot of people out there who consider fast charging to be an extraneous feature,” Desjarlais says. “But there’s also a lot of people out there for whom this is a big value add. It’s something you don’t really realize how good it is for your day-to-day life until you have to rush out the door to catch a cab in five minutes and your phone isn’t really charged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGkfe0"&gt;Xiaomi’s international launch event for the 11T Pro and the rest of the 11T series is taking place next week on Wednesday, September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s downloads page just got a lot more informative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJETzbnAXPMPO6V2nhtyxku5Vz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838769/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmtZWj"&gt;Valve has just released a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;big update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of small but significant tweaks to the digital games store. Many of these changes have been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-client-beta-overhauls-downloads-page-and-storage-management-looks-great/"&gt;available in beta for months&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re hitting the software’s stable release channel. The update overhauls the downloads page and introduces a much improved section for managing your storage, amongst a host of other tweaks and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWFF0a"&gt;The downloads page has seen the bulk of the improvements. For starters, as well as showing download progress, the page also now shows installation progress. It should cut down on those frustrating moments when a game appears to be fully downloaded but isn’t playable because it’s not yet fully installed. The priority of downloads in the queue can now be easily reordered by dragging and dropping them, and the interface generally looks a lot cleaner overall. The “View News” button has been renamed “Patch Notes,” to make it easier to find what’s changed in a currently-downloading update, so long as developers have provided that information. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ER2qYjSVn2ZJVQ9MOSh3eV7oTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839401/steamwebhelper_E1Od5BYdSe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Steam&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new storage management interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="71EGcx"&gt;Steam’s storage management section has also been improved to make it easier to see your available storage and move games between drives. You can get to it by going to Settings, Downloads, and then clicking “Steam Library Folders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cybp08"&gt;Those are the main improvements, but there are a host of other tweaks and fixes included in the update, which should be available to all users now. Steam should update itself automatically, but you can also click on “Steam” in the software’s menu bar, and then selecting “Check for Steam Client Updates…” to manually check. You can check out a full list of changes on &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;Steam’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Material You design is coming to Gmail, Calendar, and Docs on Android</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RitgUJ"&gt;Google is starting to roll out its new Material You design system to Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and more on Android. The new look will include changes to navigation bars, improved action buttons, and Google’s Sans text for better readability. It’s part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;bigger Android 12 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that includes big, bubbly buttons, shifting colors, smoother animations, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663710/android-12-beta-5-ui-updates-features-clock-widgets-search-bar-calculator"&gt;overhauls to built-in apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYtqg5"&gt;The design changes mean Pixel devices with Android 12 or newer will be able to match the colors inside apps like Gmail, Google Meet, and Google Drive with their wallpapers for &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/material-you-for-android.html"&gt;what Google calls&lt;/a&gt; a “more dynamic, personalized look.” Existing color schemes and color-coded file types and folders will remain unchanged within the apps, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spPCFRnccNqFxU05SjdF9yFLG4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839365/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_3.26.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The subtle changes to the Gmail app design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jtArJjbuBHa1uA5Mxg3GT1liXsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839366/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_3.32.07_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is leaning in to more rounded corners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPh7JW"&gt;The end result is subtle but colorful changes to apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Docs. Google has really leaned further into rounded corners here, and the changes are mostly aesthetic, meaning button placements and core navigation won’t be changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUJbJ"&gt;The design changes are already available in Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. They will also appear in Google Calendar on September 20th, and Google Meet on September 19th. All of the design changes are available to both personal Google accounts and Google Workspace customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw59Vp6iuCSMLr2W7hB1I19xOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838523/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_821.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;” than seen on previous models. The new design has reportedly forced Apple to use new production processes that created “reliability issues” in early test runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bzzk4o"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Watch 7 from last weekend: “We’ll see an announcement during the usual September event alongside the iPhone, but there will be a mix of the models shipping late or in small quantities.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O"&gt;https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGjrET"&gt;Now, however, these issues are thought to have been resolved, with shipments expected to begin in late September. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, however, although Apple will announce the new Watch next week, some of the models could ship “late or in small quantities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0nXvk"&gt;As well as the flatter display, the new smartwatch is expected to come with slightly larger 41mm and 45mm cases (up from 40mm and 44mm currently), bumping the largest display from 1.78 inches to 1.9 inches diagonally. The watches are also rumored to have a faster processor and updated wireless tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2ZQnxXtXtKmSK-HQGqIANMbcsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838305/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNlCJzWhvaL4iJTap0cLoW47L58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839129/applemusic_6001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQg5zT"&gt;So yes, the same fingerprint ID tech that tells you the name of a song playing in the mall can apparently figure out which festival it’s from, which DJ’s mix it is, and pick out different sounds as they blend together. This is apparently detailed enough, relying on matching across Apple Music’s database of 75 million songs or so, to enable recurring revenue streams for the clubs that host sets and the DJs that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTumey"&gt;There’s a dedicated genre page for DJ mixes within the Apple Music app, and the company says engagement has tripled in the last twelve months, with over 300 million streams of DJ mixes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Un-C3A-NrrZPin1pIWYhKSifwl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839132/applemusic_600t.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBPrU"&gt;Apple has already been on a tear adding mixes over the last year or so, including some from Charlotte de Witte, Tiësto, Carl Cox, and others. Studio K7! founder Horst Weidenmueller said in a statement that “Through the partnership with Apple we finally have a place to celebrate DJ-Kicks with additional 14 editions which haven‘t been in the market for over 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PERn2v"&gt;Apple Music says it’s commissioning more mixes (following series released earlier this year to mark Black Music Month and Pride) and working closely with DJs to get additional content on the service. This is a new path for getting DJ mixes onto Apple Music alongside older ones like Dubset’s platform. If you already enjoy existing mixes on Apple Music, we’re told they aren’t going anywhere, even if they don’t have all the new features included. Still, it isn’t yet accessible for bedroom DJs or lesser-known names posting their mixtapes to SoundCloud, so there’s some room between this and the wild days of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape"&gt;Muxtape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
