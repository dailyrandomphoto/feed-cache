    <title>The Royal Navy is testing using jet suits to fight high-seas piracy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IhxgtnyA7utTdC_L3QlAtPXP9vc=/469x0:4060x2394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235738/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_10.00.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdYlg0"&gt;The British Royal Navy has apparently been testing using jet suits to board ships like a scene out of some scrapped Christopher Nolan film, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHOLFhbwsM"&gt;according to a new video&lt;/a&gt; released by UK-based Gravity Industries. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-royal-marines-board-ship-at-sea-with-jet-packs-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that the tests were conducted over three days on the HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy Batch 2 River-class offshore patrol ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEA3KD"&gt;Royal Marines used Gravity Industries’ Jet Suit to conduct a “visit, board, search, and seizure” operation or VBSS. Basically a marine launched from a fast boat tailing the HMS Tamar, flew through the air like a slightly askew Iron Man, and landed on the larger ship, dropping a rope below so their fast boat buddies could climb up and “visit” the simulated enemy vessel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PnotiW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suHOLFhbwsM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIoy3M"&gt;The whole thing is very cool, to the point of almost seeming like a wire-assisted fake, and likely as much an ad for the Royal Navy and Gravity Industries as it is an actual test of the Gravity Jet Suit’s utility in a naval exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvZjoL"&gt;If the suit or its creators sound familiar, it’s because the company has been demonstrating its Iron Man tech for a while now, though in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16018410/sdcc-2017-best-of-marvel-stranger-things-favorites"&gt;Gravity Industries CEO Richard Browning has been in the pilot seat&lt;/a&gt; (or suit, in this case). This also isn’t the first time the Royal Navy has helped demo the tech. In 2019, Browning flew an earlier version of the Jet Suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189636/gravity-industries-richard-browning-jet-suit-royal-marines-assault-course-watch"&gt;through the Royal Navy’s assault course&lt;/a&gt;. Gravity Industries has also collaborated with the Dutch Maritime Special Operations Force (SOF) to put the suit through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzmFt6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2KvlQKdBo8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Dov2q"&gt;The suit seems to have been streamlined since these earlier demonstrations, featuring smaller arm rockets and a sleeker backpack jet more fitting for whatever sci-fi movie vibe Gravity Industries seems to be cultivating. What is sort of disappointing is mostly finding military applications of this technology when there are clearly plenty of other uses. Luckily, Gravity Industries has us covered there, too: the company has tested using the Jet Suit with the &lt;a href="https://www.greatnorthairambulance.co.uk/"&gt;Great North Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, a UK charity that rescues people from mountain ranges and a variety of other emergency scenarios in Northern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4cWsaS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtvCnZqZnxc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Epic pushed Xbox chief to open free multiplayer just ahead of Apple Fortnite battle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sDLwcoLMB_7QFqiZIOUbrIURjFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235612/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2736R"&gt;Epic pushed Microsoft to open up its Xbox network for free multiplayer gaming just weeks before the Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle. In the weeks leading up to Epic Games’ decision to circumvent Apple’s 30 percent cut on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases, CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Xbox chief Phil Spencer teasing something big and asking whether Microsoft could time free multiplayer with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ78ST"&gt;“Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users,” said Sweeney. “While I can’t share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic’s assurance that our efforts will be positive and supportive of Microsoft, Xbox and Windows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dt6vpQO2R3YJYh1BSSb9Gqd55uw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491332/t9cDsT9.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic’s email to Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TOgHmyTmsIoAMFZPidkJm25nt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491333/d2jwCbS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s response to Epic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vMFokR"&gt;Sweeney also asked Spencer whether free Xbox Live multiplayer was coming, and whether Microsoft could time it to support &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14, the season Epic Games launched its alternate payment method that got &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; kicked off the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNT7vF"&gt;Spencer replied that “we will get there and I want to partner with you,” and that pushing these policies was “at the highest levels” at Microsoft, but implied Xbox Live wasn’t ready to go free multiplayer just yet. “Totally understood!” said Sweeney in response. “I gather there’s a lot going on at Microsoft nowadays. Anyway, you’ll enjoy the upcoming fireworks show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsjUX1"&gt;The timing of the email is provocative, given the events that followed. Had Spencer gone along with the plan, it seems likely that Xbox could have opened up Fortnite to non-Gold subscribers at the same time that Apple was shutting out the game entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv0JeY"&gt;The fireworks show that Sweeney promised certainly kicked off when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14 launched, and it has since resulted in Epic Games taking Apple to court in a trial that’s ongoing. Microsoft did eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395433/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-free-multiplayer-games-party-chat"&gt;unlock Xbox Live free-to-play multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; last month, but it wasn’t as simple as Epic Games had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gi3eW"&gt;Microsoft’s removal of the Xbox Live Gold requirement came after the company was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;reverse a price hike&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Live Gold subscriptions earlier this year. Microsoft had attempted to double the cost of a yearly Xbox Live Gold subscription, a move that backfired. Microsoft quickly reversed the decision and offered to remove the paywall for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WNBA to stream games on Twitter, Facebook, and Paramount Plus</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7y40tf"&gt;For its upcoming 25th season, the Women’s National Basketball Association will broadcast games on Twitter, Facebook Watch, Oculus, and the &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1059515/3065?subId1=VergeWNBA050421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; streaming platform, &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-announces-broadcast-and-streaming-schedule-for-leagues-25th-regular-season/"&gt;the league announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlitGW"&gt;Twelve games will air on Twitter, and tweets from fans will be included as part of the broadcast. Facebook will stream 20 WNBA games on its Watch platform and its Oculus Quest and Quest 2 VR headsets, and three games will be shown on Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m9foU"&gt;ESPN’s platforms will show 25 regular-season games, three on ESPN, 12 games on ESPN2, and nine games on ABC. The WNBA’s All Star Game will also air on ESPN, and ESPN networks will cover 19 post-season games during the playoffs. All regular-season and post-season games that air on ESPN will also stream live on the ESPN app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Gp1yS"&gt;The league also announced a new partnership with Google, which is joining Deloitte, Nike, and AT&amp;amp;T as a WNBA “Changemaker.” Google chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/wnba-espn-partnership/"&gt;in a blog post announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt; that the company will be the presenting partner for the games airing on ESPN and ABC, and it will serve as a technology partner to the league. Twohill said Google is also working with ESPN to add a dedicated segment on women’s sports for its SportsCenter show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OugckP"&gt;Google is also working with &lt;a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2020/09/espn-films-producing-documentary-project-on-maya-moore/"&gt;ESPN on a &lt;em&gt;30 for 30&lt;/em&gt; documentary&lt;/a&gt; focused on four-time WNBA champion Maya Moore, who took a sabbatical from the Minnesota Lynx to push for criminal justice reform. &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/wnba/2020/9/16/21439514/maya-moore-married-jonathan-irons-wnba"&gt;Moore was instrumental in overturning&lt;/a&gt; the wrongful conviction of her now-husband Jonathan Irons, who was facing 50 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxbQfG"&gt;The new WNBA season kicks off May 14th. The full schedule of regular season games &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/schedule/"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of Samsung’s best phones ever is now officially retired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus rear view" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dDkt6Hi-KKqo3wFzuqknvwMqMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235494/jbareham_170414_1603_0044.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After four years of support, the S8 and S8 Plus will no longer receive security updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CVLJg"&gt;Four years after its launch, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has received its last security update. The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjJvyk"&gt;The S8 marked a design shift for Galaxy devices, with a wider-aspect edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezels that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications"&gt;one of the best-looking phones&lt;/a&gt; we’d seen at that point. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;wasn’t just a good-looking device, either&lt;/a&gt;; it offered excellent hardware and a great camera, combined with a remarkably restrained software implementation. Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DuyWyZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has one of the best support policies in the industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5X9xL1"&gt;Samsung recently introduced a formal policy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;providing Galaxy devices with four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, including both S-series flagships and even budget-oriented A-series models. Premium devices tend to get monthly updates, at least for the first couple of years, with the cadence slowing down to quarterly or biannual updates toward end of life. It’s one of the best support policies in the industry — certainly for Android, and roughly on par with Apple’s typically lengthy device support schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGe1su"&gt;While the S8 and S8 Plus have reached the end of that support period, the S8 Active is still &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;on the schedule&lt;/a&gt; for quarterly updates and the S8 Lite is on the biannual schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this devastating look at cancers going undiagnosed during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Radiology center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAjv-LadnOxNwY9Jnjjjw17oE5k=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235315/838190898.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A routine mammogram | Photo by: BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sa3dSK"&gt;In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as people avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals canceled nonessential appointments, routine cancer screenings plummeted. Now, we’re starting to see the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDnlfN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of Teresa Ruvalcaba, a factory worker in Chicago who ignored searing pain in her chest for six months. She was busy with work and afraid of catching COVID-19 at the doctor’s office, and when she finally went to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with advanced inflammatory breast cancer. It was one of the most severe cases oncologist Pam Khosla had seen in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9ca98"&gt;Cancer death rates have dropped over 30 percent since the early 1990s, a decline fueled by early detection and new treatments. But the past year caused an extraordinary, unprecedented disruption in cancer care. People didn’t come to the hospital until their health had deteriorated so badly that they struggled to breathe, Khosla described to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="O7tYl5"&gt;Recently, she counted at least 10 cases of advanced cancer in one four-week period. She saw one patient with a grapefruit-sized mass on his neck. Another, whose tumor had pushed his brain dangerously close to the skull, was transferred to hospice. “He never got to see the light of treatment,” Khosla said. All of these patients had been afraid to seek treatment at the hospital during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HxQnKJ"&gt;It’ll be years before we see the full extent of the harm caused by pandemic-driven delays in cancer treatment. The National Cancer Institute predicts that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;postponements&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in diagnosing breast and colorectal cancer will lead to around 10,000 excess deaths in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhqeLS"&gt;Ruvalcaba’s story adds a face to the faceless statistics around diagnosis delays and shows in vivid detail how the ripple effects from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to quietly impact families all across the country for years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOUFdG"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new originals starring Will Smith and Alicia Keys  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3snEN5Uw3pl39bB5UkHWbkXWGQ=/233x0:2180x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235189/will_smith_brandcast.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Will Smith has a new fitness show coming to YouTube. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="we1uTI"&gt;YouTube announced a new slate of original series today that includes some huge stars at the top of the lineup. Will Smith will star in a six-part reality series about fitness and “returning his body into the best shape of his life,” and a four-part series will go behind the scenes with Alicia Keys as she records a new album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHJ3vY"&gt;The new lineup of originals also includes a third season of Liza Koshy’s &lt;em&gt;Liza on Demand&lt;/em&gt;; a new special focused on Asian American chefs, celebrities, activists, and creators that counts LeBron James and Michelle Kwan as executive producers; and a new special called &lt;em&gt;Barbershop Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that explores the intersection of race and socioeconomic status that came out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt; that was announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbNkvi"&gt;YouTube has regularly changed up its approach to original content since it started making originals about five years ago. They started out as subscriber-only shows centered around creators, pivoted to ad-supported shows featuring mainstream stars like Kevin Hart and Will Smith (making this his second&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;YouTube original), and more recently have delivered more of a mix of the two, with most shows being largely available to anyone who visits YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNjwKD"&gt;Still, big names like Will Smith and Alicia Keys guarantee views, and they provide credibility to YouTube and comfort for advertisers who may be worried about some of the platform’s wilder content. These series were, not coincidentally, announced in the middle of a YouTube presentation for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkpXdM"&gt;Will Smith’s new series will debut next year; Alicia Keys’ arrives this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus buys Sanho and its Hyper line of accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sKYdxjskUIQmn07vJsTwmJJzlkQ=/38x0:1544x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235146/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_12.11.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BC4uX"&gt;Two companies that have built their businesses on computer accessories are coming together. Targus, a company best known for its laptop cases and bags, today &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Ftargus-to-acquire-hyper-by-sanho-corporation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419204%2Ftargus-acquires-sanho-hyper-drive-usb-c-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced that it’s acquiring Sanho&lt;/a&gt;. You might not be familiar with Sanho itself, but it’s more likely you’d recognize the company’s Hyper and HyperDrive lineup of USB-C accessories that are sold on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3Dhyperdrive&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA5bLz"&gt;Targus CEO Mikel Williams said the deal “allows for Targus to add capability and support to Hyper’s growing tech brand, and gives Hyper access to new channels, customers and a global footprint of sales and marketing resources.” Williams added that “Hyper has a strong and exciting brand that has excellent reach into the Apple community and, importantly, the combination also brings really talented people to our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgXqdR"&gt;That “reach” Williams mentions is probably a reference to the USB-C hubs that Hyper specifically designs to fit and latch onto Apple’s MacBooks and iPad Pro devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPebkEixHN9Xkw8bqvMXoaLFgCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491130/hyper.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyper&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RWwB5Q"&gt;The company has also recently launched more powerful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fcollections%2Fenterprise-usb-c-docking-stations&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419204%2Ftargus-acquires-sanho-hyper-drive-usb-c-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Gen2” USB-C hubs&lt;/a&gt; that offer faster performance than earlier models. “We focus on first-to-market, award winning innovative products, that will bring long term value to the combined company,” said Daniel Chin, Hyper’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1r0DY"&gt;Chin will continue to oversee Hyper as president. Targus and Hyper will maintain their separate brand identities and stay in their respective headquarters. (Targus is based in Anaheim, California, and Hyper operates out of the Silicon Valley area.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood crypto trading crashed during a Dogecoin spike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUSRA-44RxnmgY4TDA0JWBJZtN8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235047/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JqQqnJ"&gt;Robinhood ran into issues processing cryptocurrency trades this morning, during a spike in the price of Dogecoin that sent users flocking to the app. The website &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/robinhood/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; shows the outage starting around 9:30AM ET and reducing in severity about an hour later. Robinhood confirmed that it experienced a “partial outage” in crypto trading and said the issues had been resolved as of 11:15AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tq2Zmv"&gt;The outage was particularly noticeable since it came during a spike (and subsequent dip) in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fdogecoin&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419159%2Frobinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dogecoin prices&lt;/a&gt;. Coins were priced at around $0.40 USD at the beginning of the day. Around 8AM ET, they spiked past $0.50 USD and reached as high as $0.60 USD near 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CSWeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: Crypto trading is now fully restored. We know some customers may have experienced intermittent issues earlier. We’ll continue to monitor the situation closely and we’re sorry if you were impacted. Please contact us if you have outstanding issues. &lt;a href="https://t.co/adhugIHVGR"&gt;https://t.co/adhugIHVGR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskRobinhood/status/1389599614559346697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ic481"&gt;Users were quick to voice their frustrations with the app on Twitter, seeing it as a repeat of the situation that happened in January when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;Robinhood limited trading&lt;/a&gt; on buzzy, soaring stocks, including GameStop and AMC. In the app this morning, a message told users, “We are experiencing intermittent issues with crypto trading. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.” Meanwhile, the price ticker on Dogecoin continued its rapid flip up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTVcbl"&gt;Robinhood has made it incredibly easy for anyone to become an amateur trader of stocks or cryptocurrencies. But that’s also meant that problems with Robinhood can affect markets, since it may be the only route that a mass of traders circling a buzzy asset have to place a buy or sell order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFAK95"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;the second Dogecoin-related crypto trading outage&lt;/a&gt; on Robinhood in a matter of weeks. On April 16th, Robinhood wrote that enthusiasm for Dogecoin led to “sporadic crypto order failures.” At the time, the company said, “These interruptions aren’t acceptable to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyUXSx"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;expected to go public&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will now let you auto-caption Stories with just a sticker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gif of an Instagram story showing a person speaking and the words “It’s a beautiful day out here so we’re gonna go on a walk” appearing at the top of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qYaIDti6FUu0Jrf7IApB5sXggk=/84x0:1004x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234951/Stories_viewer_captions.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQmdNQ"&gt;Instagram now has a captions sticker for Stories, which will automatically transcribe speech in videos. The sticker will be available only in “English and English-speaking countries” for now but will eventually roll out to other languages and countries. Instagram says it will also start testing automated captions in Reels soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MuwQ4"&gt;Captions have been available in IGTV and the Threads app, and Instagram says it’s adding them to Stories and Reels to make them more efficient and inclusive to watch. The feature should be a welcome addition for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, are not native English speakers, or just generally watch videos without sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of words from the top to the bottom of the screen that say “are you a stinky little baby?” in front of a photo of a miniature dachshund sitting on a couch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iahVkkC65bVv6ZxY815tfOPNWsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489380/stinky_baby_transcript.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The edit option lists each word of the captions separately. You can tap on individual words to make adjustments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ob9iM"&gt;Like other text options in Stories, users can adjust the style and color of the captions after they’re generated. People can also edit individual words in the captions to correct spelling, punctuation, or any words that weren’t transcribed accurately. Auto captions rarely have perfect accuracy, especially for people with accents or atypical speech, so editing is crucial. There’s currently no option to have the text highlighted for better visual contrast, but you can use the draw tool or a sticker behind the captions to make them easier to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRlVG"&gt;Other platforms and services have recently added or improved auto-captioning options. Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams all offer automated captions for video calls. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337074/chrome-real-time-live-captions-audio-accessibility"&gt;expanded its Live Caption feature&lt;/a&gt; across the Chrome browser in March, and TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369507/tiktok-automatic-captions-accessibility-feature-american-english-japanese"&gt;launched automatic captions&lt;/a&gt; for American English and Japanese last month. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s planning improvements for the captioning it offers in Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I watched the Epic v. Apple trial on Discord</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_2ofJo03CB67DgkOlh75y4KH9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234875/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrLMk1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial started on Monday, and if you wanted to follow along and listen to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney talk about the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” your options were limited. In theory, there’s public access to the trial, like most court proceedings, but since the courthouse is still closed for lockdown, the only access was through the court’s teleconference line that was briefly overrun by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417347/epic-games-apple-fortnite-trial-public-call"&gt;screaming teens&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuIgNO"&gt;But for anyone looking for more user-friendly options, there’s good news. A surprising, small community of streamers has decided to rebroadcast the trial on streaming platforms — places built for the people who play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;rather than the antitrust policy wonks in the courtroom. For yesterday’s proceeding, I found a handful of YouTube channels and streamers rebroadcasting the hearing online, including Geoff Keighley (gaming’s Ryan Seacrest) on the Game Awards YouTube channel. Keighley’s YouTube stream sat at around 1,000 viewers throughout Monday’s events, featuring an active side chat filled with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans and foes negging the day’s witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wW2h1"&gt;Technically, you’re not supposed to do this. &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/cases-e-filing/cases-of-interest/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;The court’s website&lt;/a&gt; explicitly tells users that “any recording, copying, or rebroadcasting of a remote court hearing is absolutely prohibited.” Electronic recording devices &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/supreme-court-video"&gt;are often banned&lt;/a&gt; from public sessions for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIF6SS"&gt;But because you’re breaking the court’s rules and not copyright law, streaming the trial is much less likely to result in an account strike than a sports or television live stream. And while conventional media outlets could have their press credentials stripped for defying the ban, most streamers are far enough outside that system that they don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZdr3c"&gt;A separate &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;streamer, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmpwZJPSf_QPSKxY9CFCstg"&gt;Golden&lt;/a&gt; (112,000 subscribers), was also following the court hearing, providing commentary for his followers interested in the day’s events. In order to avoid ticking off the court, he muted the trial’s audio and provided a link to Keighley’s stream for viewers looking to follow along themselves. He also listed his Discord server in the video’s bio and had three audio rooms dedicated to re-streaming Keighley’s audio. The Discord’s general chat was a mix of armchair antitrust lawyers and others complaining about Sweeney’s bad mic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcAJiv"&gt;“Bruh this audio,” one person wrote, responding to Sweeney’s mumbling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7vrjf"&gt;It’s hard to say how many streamers will be active for today’s proceedings — but if you’re hoping to follow along, searching YouTube and Twitch for rebroadcasts might turn up more options than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o02Oo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
