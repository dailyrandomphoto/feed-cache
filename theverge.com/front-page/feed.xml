    <title>Twitter’s latest pre-tweet prompts let you know when you’re about to jump into a Twitter fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5jWyC9v_4ffow50pP1DUTHyHkU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69961010/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wPbbWw"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445824131040120835"&gt;is testing&lt;/a&gt; new prompts on iOS and Android that warn before you jump into a conversation that could get heated. In one example, there’s a prompt dropped right into a conversation in progress that says “conversations like this can be intense.” In another, which seems like it appears if you try to reply to one of those intense conversations, is titled “let’s look out for each other” and lays out three bullet points to encourage empathetic and fact-based conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0fNMr"&gt;You can get a look at the prompts in the tweet below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Yrewk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ever want to know the vibe of a conversation before you join in? We’re testing prompts on Android and iOS that give you a heads up if the convo you’re about to enter could get heated or intense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a work in progress as we learn how to better support healthy conversation. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x6Nsn3HPu1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x6Nsn3HPu1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445824131040120835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkrbQr"&gt;The prompts are the company’s latest attempt to reduce the persistent harassment and abuse on the platform. One other prompt, for example, warns you before you tweet something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;that might be offensive&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter also might show a prompt if you try to retweet an article &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;it thinks you haven’t read&lt;/a&gt;, which could help decrease the spread of misinformation. While they might help prevent some bad tweets from being shared, the growing list of potential warnings to wade through before you tweet is a worrying indicator of the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEFPMd"&gt;As always, if you’re not sure if you should post something, the best pre-tweet prompt is the one that Twitter won’t show you: never tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...?’s ending was spoiled weeks ago by Thor in a Hyundai commercial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H1YHOh4G3AbkX2gQLi6CzG03Hd0=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960992/R_Pd3OBbWW8_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC56VI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If..?&lt;/em&gt;’s finale debuted on Disney Plus today, and it brought some bigger multiversal mayhem with it. But fans may have already gotten the big reveal of the finale spoiled for them all the way back in August… &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Pd3OBbWW8"&gt;thanks to a Hyundai Tucson commercial&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9oV8j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for “What If… The Watcher Broke His Oath” and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What If…?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s first season below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa11jq"&gt;Marvel projects are no stranger to commercials and product placement, of course, but the Hynduai commercial (part of a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_M56nIzX5A"&gt;series of ads&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been doing together with Disney Plus) marks a particularly strange turn — one that mashes storytelling with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf1q3K"&gt;The main conceit of the bulk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt;’s early episodes&lt;/a&gt; was that the series was an anthology, providing standalone tales in different corners of Marvel’s multiverse that offered alternative takes on the existing films. Each episode was linked together through the narration of Uatu the Watcher, a god-like being that existed to observe — but not intervene in — the events of the divergent timelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yiOYrH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What If...? is a playful expansion of Marvel’s multiverse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"},{"title":"What If...?’s art style aims to keep characters ‘feeling monumental and powerful’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652048/marvel-what-if-character-design-interview-ryan-meinerding"},{"title":"Star Wars: Visions has a lot more fun than Marvel’s What If…?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702623/star-wars-visions-marvel-what-if-animated-anthologies-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tNGf4d"&gt;Of course, the MCU being the MCU, where interconnected storytelling reigns supreme, it soon became clear that &lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; was barrelling towards a multiversal mashup, incited by the rise of an Infinity Stone-powered Ultron/Vision hybrid introduced in the previous episode, dubbed “Infinity Ultron.” Infinity Ultron aimed to use its power to last waste, not just to its own universe, but, thanks to the comic awareness granted by possessing all six stones, to all universes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vn1nN"&gt;In response, Uatu (after futilely duking it out in a cosmic brawl) decides to break his policy of nonintervention and gathers together a group of heroes from the previous &lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; episodes (and an alternate version of Gamora whose episode was pushed to next season after COVID delays) to form “The Guardians of the Multiverse” to defeat Infinity Ultron and save the MCU’s fledgling multiverse from destruction. Superheroics ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1yasQE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-Pd3OBbWW8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0mcx2"&gt;The foundation of the Guardians of the Multiverse is meant to be a major moment in the show. Uatu breaks his sacred oath and crosses the line from observer to participant in Marvel’s adventures. It unites separate heroes from across different Marvel installments to unite against a larger foe, almost like an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; movie in miniature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4dgN1"&gt;But to anyone who’d seen the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Pd3OBbWW8"&gt;Hyundai Tucson&lt;/a&gt; commercial — which has been airing for months, in as prominent of places as primetime NFL games — the entire concept had already been spoiled months in advance. The ad shows various heroes from &lt;em&gt;What If…?,&lt;/em&gt; including Captain Carter, T’Challa, Star-Lord, Strange Supreme, and the hard-partying Thor being brought together by The Watcher to lay waste to an army of Ultron drones (albeit with the help of an incongruous placed Hyundai).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fS9rwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spoiler culture doesn’t stand a chance against car commercials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utIDEk"&gt;The weirdly spoilery Hyundai commercial is the perfect example of the current state of spoiler culture in 2021, especially as streaming has expanded to include major franchises like Star Wars and Marvel that rely the most on their big moments and reveals. In an age of overly long trailers that reveal major plot points or villains, or the vast Twitter threads and trending topics that appear minutes after shows debut in the middle of the night, what’s one more national ad campaign that reveals a big surprise of a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0lLuv"&gt;There’s more to &lt;em&gt;What If…? &lt;/em&gt;and its finale than a car commercial can show. And with more Disney Plus shows on the way — and presumably, more corporate tie-ins to go with them — it’s likely that this latest crack in the Marvel wall of secrecy is just another thing that fans and creators will have to learn to live with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="es94Z0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtgUF7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the new entry-level iPad just introduced for 2021, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or the latest iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. While the best deals of the year may be just around the corner with Black Friday and Cyber Monday, here is what is worth your consideration if you’re looking to make a purchase here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-generation model of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model. The ones you can currently find in stock, such as at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJrISyuZP4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are full price. Without any significant discounts, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Walmart is the only retailer currently discounting the new iPad, offering $30 off both Wi-Fi models. The &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB model is currently available for $299&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model is on sale for $449&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer extended this 10 percent discount even while the ninth-gen iPad was still on preorder, and it has remained fairly consistent in its availability. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664329-REG%2Fapple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJr7KwG8AZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; all have the new iPad for its normal price at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as its previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs for its time. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s recent “California Streaming” event. The new Mini starts at a higher price point of $499, but unfortunately, the outgoing iPad Mini — with its older A12 Bionic processor — is a bit slim on the deals front right now. Most retailers that still have it are selling it at the full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around. We have seen the base 64GB recently drop to $299, but the only worthwhile deal to speak of right now is Walmart’s discount on the 256GB unit — it has that model for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F425274991&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$449, saving you $100&lt;/a&gt;. That drops it lower than the starting price of the new iPad Mini, and it’s a full $200 less if you compare the old and new models on equal footing when it comes to storage. This could be a great opportunity for anyone who needs more storage or prefers the classic home button, Touch ID, or a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upjL8U"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fifth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u8gdV"&gt;The 2021 iPad Mini just received one of its first notable discounts from Adorama, which is currently offering &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html%3Femailprice%3Dt&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadevergreendeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 off the base Wi-Fi model with 64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the price down to $474.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. We, of course, will keep an eye out for more deals on the new Mini, so be sure to keep checking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is also available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$699&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $900 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Some similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. The 256GB model is $949 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,099 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,300&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

That shaves $100 off the cost of either of those massive storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The desirable Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.

    <title>The founder of Facebook’s CrowdTangle tool is leaving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sAx6wMyKow1Vlu87XKpJB8br9WY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960654/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vR9bZ"&gt;Brandon Silverman, the founder and CEO of the Facebook-owned analytics tool CrowdTangle, is leaving the company, according to an internal farewell post to colleagues posted Wednesday that was seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAXuxg"&gt;His departure comes as Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;under pressure&lt;/a&gt; to publicly share more data about the content that spreads on its service. CrowdTangle, a free tool that lets anyone track popular posts across Facebook and Instagram, is at the center of that debate. In recent years, it has been used to show that far-right personalities are regularly the most engaged-with accounts on Facebook. That irritated some Facebook executives who felt that the data being shared by CrowdTangle was incomplete, and earlier this year, the CrowdTangle team was disbanded as a standalone team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuHsqY"&gt;Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne confirmed Silverman’s departure and said it would have “no change on day-to-day functioning of the CrowdTangle product experience.” He added that Silverman left the management of CrowdTangle after it was moved into Facebook’s broader Integrity organization a couple of months ago, which also houses the company’s ads library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1ZPrb"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; internal debates between CrowdTangle staffers and Facebook executives who reportedly wanted to selectively share data about top posts. The idea was to refute the notion that Facebook was dominated by sensationalist, right-leaning content. &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;said that Silverman was on the side pushing for disclosing more data to the public, even if it could make the company look bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTs2l3"&gt;Facebook has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/22/22636508/facebook-releases-shelved-content-transparency-report-content-coronavirus"&gt;put out a couple of reports&lt;/a&gt; showing the most viewed content on the platform, which it says provides a more holistic view of what people see, rather than the data CrowdTangle provides on posts with the most likes and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n0EuMt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t do this work because you’re looking for some specific outcome or credibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5raMRq"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle"&gt;bought CrowdTangle in 2016&lt;/a&gt; as it was courting media companies to post more on its News Feed, and the tool is still used to track viral posts on the social network. “You don’t do this work because you’re looking for some specific outcome or credibility or legitimacy or trust, but because so many public interest orgs simply need this data to do their work,” Silverman said in his farewell post to employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr7hkV"&gt;“I’m not sure what the future holds for CrowdTangle or data transparency here at Facebook, but I’m optimistic,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeNMtK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve opens up a Steam Deck to explain why it thinks you shouldn’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The inside of a Steam Deck." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WNO1MjuN_PRE7_T6yKYTMQZMc-U=/151x0:1768x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960594/bdddb89899430cef189a44098fca1d4ec2f9512f.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghmMYo"&gt;Valve has posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs"&gt;an official teardown&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming handheld gaming PC, the Steam Deck. Before diving into the teardown, though, the company spends about a minute to strongly caution against taking one apart unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwVON"&gt;“Even though it’s your PC — or it will be once you’ve received your Steam Deck — and you have every right to open it up and do what you want, we at Valve really don’t recommend that you ever open it up,” a Valve representative said in the video. “The Steam Deck is a very tightly designed system, and the parts are chosen carefully for this product with its specific construction, so they aren’t really designed to be user-swappable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The inside of a Steam Deck." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m44kPZk0fhkyUFFQ4wf3r7v1MeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905537/bdddb89899430cef189a44098fca1d4ec2f9512f.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of a Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TxSsaG"&gt;Despite its warnings, however, the company likely understands that people are going to take the Steam Deck apart anyway, so this video could be a handy resource for people who are considering doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hogvWm"&gt;In the video, Valve shows how to swap out two parts of the system. First, Valve shows how to replace the thumbsticks. The company cautions that they are completely custom, but says that it will offer a source for “replacement parts, thumbsticks, SSDs, and possibly more” in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5OyXx"&gt;After that, Valve shows how to swap out the SSD, which could be helpful for people who may have reserved the cheapest version of the device with an eMMC hard drive with the intention of upgrading it themselves. Be aware that all versions of the Steam Deck use an m.2 connector, including the version with the eMMC drive, so if you plan to make a swap, you’re going to have to reinstall the OS and bring over any games you might have had loaded on your other drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns3oUZ"&gt;Valve says the Steam Deck will begin shipping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, though the initial reservations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;flew off the virtual shelves quickly&lt;/a&gt;. If you reserve one now, you’ll have to wait until at least the second quarter of 2022 for the opportunity to actually make an order. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is making it easier to delete accounts attached to third-party apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxUHuOO390QMUu-AQFuGQ-31_kw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960516/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqpUG8"&gt;Apple will require developers that offer a way to create accounts in their apps to also offer a way to delete them, starting with app submissions on January 31st, 2022, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo"&gt;the company shared Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The account deletion requirement was originally announced alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;several other changes to Apple’s developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WWdtz"&gt;Account deletion is a minor convenience, but considering how often apps require accounts and how easy it is to delete an app without ending your relationship with the company connected to it, it’s welcome. Apple’s announcement suggests only that developers “allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app,” so it’s possible implementations of these account deletion features could bump you to a browser during some part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hb1xPI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free yourself from third-party accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1HbSp"&gt;Apple has also &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul"&gt;confirmed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of its more prominent app reporting tool &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;that was spotted on iOS a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the “Report a Problem” button is available on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and also macOS Monterey once it’s released. The button allows users to report scams or offensive, abusive, and illegal content — even for apps they haven’t purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IkTIs"&gt;Apple’s made other recent tweaks to the App Store — like allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;the company’s own apps to be reviewed&lt;/a&gt; — but for a full look at all of the changes the company has made to its storefront over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;check out our article running them down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="OfOEy7"&gt;Facebook is slowing down the release and development of some new products and features to make sure they won’t bring more scrutiny towards the company or harm children, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-slows-new-products-for-reputational-reviews-11633535983?page=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “reputational reviews” come as Facebook is facing backlash from the public and policymakers after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a wave of reports&lt;/a&gt; citing Facebook’s own research showing ways Instagram could have a negative effect on teen girls’ mental health. Facebook was also slammed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;in congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shed more light on Facebook’s internal research, as well as its business model and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYePuo"&gt;Some of Facebook’s recent public actions and statements back up the idea that it’s being extra careful right now. In late September, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;announced it’s “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on a version of Instagram made for preteens, citing concerns (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;those raised&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting) that the public had about the project. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In a Tuesday Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; responding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;the whistleblower’s testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Mark Zuckerberg said the company’s leaders would be doing “deep dives” on its current work to get a clearer picture of how Facebook is trying to make “important contributions across safety, integrity, research, and product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FPvor6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg pushed back against the whistleblower and WSJ in his post&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yG5EhO"&gt;Facebook has also pushed back against the recent reporting around it and against the claims made by Frances Haugen. In the post mentioned above, Zuckerberg called parts of her testimony “deeply illogical” and said that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting mischaracterized Facebook’s research (echoing Instagram lead &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;Adam Mosseri’s comments&lt;/a&gt;).  Facebook also claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned a group of ad transparency and misinformation researchers’ access&lt;/a&gt; to its platform because they improperly scraped data, a justification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612545/facebook-banned-third-party-researchers-inaccurate-says-ftc"&gt;which the FTC called “inaccurate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V24IoS"&gt;The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about added reviews during product and feature development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="boDoB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"},{"title":"What’s good, bad, and missing in the Facebook whistleblower’s testimony","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Bw8Wzj"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Facebook is examining its internal research that could be potentially damaging if it made its way to the public, according to some of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. This lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/technology/facebook-instagram-teenagers.html"&gt;a recent report from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which noted that Facebook’s legal team had contacted a researcher about a past report and that another researcher was told by their manager to not run any queries that could appear suspicious. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70T0yOLoTaZRmclEMQIMyrrbB8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960215/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7t7smo"&gt;For weeks, Facebook has stared down mounting anxiety over a leaked internal study about the harmful effects of Instagram on teenage girls — and Tuesday night, Mark Zuckerberg finally responded to the scandal personally. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In an open letter to Facebook staff&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg scoffed at concerns raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen, doubling down on earlier Facebook claims that the report has been misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlHHv"&gt;“If we’re going to have an informed conversation about the effects of social media on young people, it’s important to start with a full picture,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re committed to doing more research ourselves and making more research publicly available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RK8LGq"&gt;But for researchers who study social media, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal study&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the controversy was mostly confirmation of what they already knew — that Instagram makes teen girls feel worse about their bodies, and that they blame the platform for anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xcjR0"&gt;Megan Moreno, principal investigator of the Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says Haugen’s interpretation of the internal research squares perfectly with other work done on social media, especially Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X998Ow"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PITK5"&gt;“For a certain population of youth, exposure to this content can be associated with diminished body image, or body image concerns,” Moreno says. “I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCB1Jt"&gt;In fact, social media researchers have spent around ten years gathering evidence on how teen body image is affected by social media. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15002249"&gt;Studies regularly find&lt;/a&gt; that teen and preteen girls who use Facebook, for example, are less satisfied with their bodies and do more self-objectification. &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2013.0305"&gt;One 2014 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of around 100 middle and high school girls showed that those who spent more time with Facebook photos had more weight dissatisfaction and more of a drive to be thin. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431613501083?journalCode=jeaa"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that girls who spent more time online and on social media were more likely to diet. More recent studies on Instagram show similar findings: female college students were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144518301360"&gt;less satisfied with their bodies&lt;/a&gt; after seeing Instagram images of thin body types. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144516300936"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; of that same demographic showed that seeing images of peers and celebrities from Instagram led to more body dissatisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Go5V"&gt;Facebook has defended itself by pointing out that Instagram makes other teens feel better about themselves — but that’s also been duplicated by other studies, and not all the researchers find it reassuring. Teens who are confident in themselves already might not be negatively affected by Instagram, Moreno says, or it may help their self confidence — but kids who have lower self esteem are still vulnerable to the negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2EOTU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UG2Brb"&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer,” Moreno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re acknowledging that the people you harmed were already at risk, that suggests you’re uniquely disabling people that are vulnerable, I’m not sure that argument suggests that you’re out for people’s best interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbVAnC"&gt;The findings fit into a larger body of work on &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2010.525737"&gt;other forms of media&lt;/a&gt;, like reality television and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2016.1250702"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt;. Teen and adolescent girls who interact with that content also tend to say they’re more dissatisfied with their bodies. They’re also more likely to spend more time comparing themselves to others, and that type of social comparison is linked to anxiety and fears around the way they’re judged by others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIG7oE"&gt;Social media, though, is unique in that users are seeing people they know. “There’s this sense that you’re comparing yourself to people that you’re connected to, in some way,” Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5jsxj"&gt;The Facebook data’s consistency with past research also makes it harder to explain away the findings, and cast doubt on the &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21072223-instagram-teen-annotated-research-deck-1"&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt; Facebook made when it released the underlying report. The research appears from the published slides to be strong and carefully done, Moreno says. “The design is excellent,” she says. “Their study was designed in the way that I’ve seen many others designed, which again is I think a measure of its quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHKeyA"&gt;Facebook also argued that the data wasn’t representative of all Instagram users, that there were also findings about positive benefits from Instagram, and that the number of people surveyed in some cases was small. But while pointing out limitations is an important part of analyzing research data, the limitations here are similar to what might be seen in other studies, Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSyLmn"&gt;“Presumably, they got the data they asked for, they got exactly what they were looking for,” Moreno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “but they didn’t like what it told them.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medtronic issues ‘urgent’ recall of insulin pump controller vulnerable to hacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DOUNIAMAG-US-CANADA-POLITICS-HEALTH-INSURANCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFX5U5vMxRCM8h1qlZuUTUUspac=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960095/1197447170.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1H03Kp"&gt;Medical device company Medtronic issued an &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice16-letter"&gt;urgent recall&lt;/a&gt; of the remote controller for certain insulin pumps because they’re vulnerable to hacks. It’s possible for someone to copy the signals sent from the controllers to the pumps and deliver or block a dose of insulin, which could be dangerous for diabetic patients using the pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBiGa3"&gt;In the recall statement, Medtronic said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that it wasn’t aware of any situations where this type of hack has occurred. The company was first made aware of the issue in 2018 after an independent cybersecurity researcher found the vulnerability and told users about the problem. That initial alert told users how to disable the remote control feature when they weren’t using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njJtXa"&gt;Now, the company says people shouldn’t use the remotes. “After further review, Medtronic has determined that the potential risks associated with the MiniMed remote controller outweigh the benefits of its continued use,” it said in the recall alert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmRq47"&gt;Medtronic also put out &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice11-letter"&gt;a safety notice&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 warning about the risk of hacks in the same set of insulin pumps, the MiniMed 508 insulin pump and the MiniMed Paradigm family of insulin pumps. The Food and Drug Administration also got involved and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-cybersecurity-concerns-certain"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the agency was concerned about the potential for someone to hack into the pumps and change the dose of insulin delivered to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QefiVa"&gt;Experts have worried about the cybersecurity risks of insulin pumps for nearly a decade, since security researcher Jay Radcliffe &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;broke into his own Medtronic pump&lt;/a&gt; onstage at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeCeyP"&gt;As more and more medical devices are connected to the internet and healthcare becomes a bigger target for ransomware attacks, worries about things like insulin pumps, pacemakers, and other products have only grown. “There hasn’t been a really high-profile case of a patient being killed or seriously harmed, but it’s just a matter of time,” Mike Johnson, a securities technologies expert at the University of Minnesota’s Technological Leadership Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686000/medical-device-cybersecurity-hack-minnesota"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA shuffles astronaut crew assignments amid ongoing Boeing delays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-BOEING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDy4JP8bm-UTfO26DEKsAnAi9-s=/0x107:4805x3310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959929/1234021721.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqavii"&gt;Two NASA astronauts originally slated to launch on an upcoming flight of Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft have been &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-astronaut-changes-for-upcoming-commercial-crew-missions"&gt;reassigned to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead&lt;/a&gt;, as delays continue to push back Starliner’s next flight to space. Astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada were supposed to be among the first human passengers on Starliner during its first crewed flights in the coming years. Now, they’ll fly together on SpaceX’s fifth crewed mission to the International Space Station, which is slated to take place in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adPtgS"&gt;Mann and Cassada were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17647474/nasa-commercial-crew-astronuts-spacex-boeing-dragon-starliner"&gt;assigned to fly on Starliner in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Mann was supposed to fly on the Starliner’s first crewed test flight, along with Michael Fincke and Butch Wilmore — a critical test to prove that Starliner is safe to carry people. Cassada was slated to fly on the next flight after Mann’s, Starliner’s first official crewed mission, which also includes NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Jeanette Epps. Both Mann and Cassada are rookie astronauts, while many of the other Boeing flyers have been to space before, except for Epps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JDfiRS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VNFXX"&gt;However, it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place, as Boeing is still working on a valve problem with the spacecraft. With no end in sight for the fix, NASA seemingly shuffled around crew assignments so that Mann and Cassada could get their first taste of space sooner rather than later. “Nicole and Josh have done a tremendous job pioneering the training and path forward for astronauts to fly on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft,” Kathy Lueders, associate administrator of the space operations at NASA, said in a statement. “They have gained experience that they will take forward as they train to fly in SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and serve aboard the International Space Station.” The reassignment was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/nasa-likely-to-move-some-astronauts-off-starliner-due-to-extended-delays/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g7MhILEhfBF-WoUOyvycas9Y7AE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905253/mann_cassada.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek7zix"&gt;Starliner is a Boeing-built spacecraft, designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The vehicle is one of two made for the program; the other is SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which launched its first crew of astronauts in May 2020. As part of the development process, NASA wanted each company to launch its vehicle on an uncrewed test flight, followed by a test flight with crew on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4p0T1"&gt;So far, Starliner has only flown once without passengers on board, and its debut flight did not go to plan. During its launch, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;suffered multiple software glitches&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately prevented the vehicle from reaching the orbit it needed to achieve to meet up with the International Space Station. Boeing was able to bring the spacecraft back to Earth safely, but NASA launched an investigation into the flight, coming up with a total of 80 corrective actions the agency wanted Boeing to take before proceeding. NASA and Boeing agreed that the company would get a do-over mission, in which Starliner would launch again without people on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5uemM"&gt;However, it’s still an open question when that redo will take place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing hoped to fly a passenger-less Starliner again this summer&lt;/a&gt; and even got as close as stacking the spacecraft on top of an Atlas V rocket on the launchpad. But the launch had to be postponed just hours before liftoff after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;Boeing discovered issues with some of Starliner’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the company took Starliner off its rocket and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623609/boeing-starliner-capsule-iss-launch-valve-troubleshooting-delay"&gt;transported it back to the factory&lt;/a&gt; to take a deeper look. There hasn’t been a solid update on when the issue will be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nIi2"&gt;“We understand the agency’s need to make adjustments to get members of the current astronaut class flying experience on an operational vehicle while the development of the Starliner spacecraft continues,” Boeing said of the astronaut reassignment in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We fully support NASA’s decisions and remain committed to putting the safety of the astronauts who will fly on our vehicle first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYiPuo"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX successfully completed its test flights with Crew Dragon and has already conducted two full passenger missions to the space station, launching a total of 10 astronauts to the ISS. The company’s next mission, called Crew-3, is slated for takeoff on October 30th. SpaceX is also slated to bring home its second group of passengers, Crew-2, from the space station in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHSV1p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
