    <title>Joe Biden halts US withdrawal from World Health Organization</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwASgN"&gt;In one of his first acts as president, Joe Biden walked back the former administration’s plan to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will participate in the organization’s executive meeting this week, according to a &lt;a href="https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/fact-sheet-president-elect-bidens-day-one-executive-actions-deliver-relief-for-families-across-america-amid-converging-crises/"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; released by the Biden-Harris transition team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q9pVh"&gt;Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274933/trump-us-who-funding-terminated-cut-china-global-health"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to cut ties with the WHO in late May, claiming that China had “total control” over the global health organization. Experts widely criticized the move, saying that it would be catastrophic for public health in the midst of a deadly pandemic. The US is a major funder for the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxDxMs"&gt;At the time the withdrawal was announced, then-presidential candidate Biden tweeted that he would rejoin the WHO on his first day as president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LpA5g7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WHO&lt;/a&gt; and restore our leadership on the world stage. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8uazVIgPZB"&gt;https://t.co/8uazVIgPZB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1280603719831359489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACul5e"&gt;Members of the United Nations have to give 12 months’ notice for this step, so the withdrawal was set to take effect on July 6th. As soon as Biden was elected, it was clear that was not going to happen. Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the WHO, congratulated Biden after he was elected in November. “My WHO colleagues and I look forward to working with you and your teams,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1325351387698520066"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkKSzn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, but that was the easy part</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Presidential Candidate Joe Biden Campaigns In Wilmington, Delaware" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/attNW0TQ-B4yDOez4X0FgCfztnw=/0x0:4826x3217/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697098/1228514843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe Biden speaks about climate change and the wildfires on the West Coast at the Delaware Museum of Natural History on September 14th, 2020, in Wilmington, Delaware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYNEqB"&gt;President Joe Biden recommitted the US to the Paris climate accord during his first day in office, fulfilling one of his earliest campaign promises. In 30 days, the US will once again be part of the global accord. Rejoining the agreement is as easy as sending a letter to the secretary-general of the United Nations. What comes after that will be much harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJVqfb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The world is very tired of seeing the US make promises we don’t keep” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AAFEgO"&gt;The US turned its back on efforts to tackle the climate crisis together as a planet when Donald Trump made the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;withdraw&lt;/a&gt; from the Paris agreement. Trump decimated federal efforts to slash emissions within the US, and he stood by other right-wing leaders — like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, who similarly dismantled environmental protections — even as their countries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836891/amazon-fires-brazil-bolsonaro-rainforest-deforestation-analysis-effects"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; like never before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20936979/california-kincade-fire-wild-climate-change-disaster-preparedness"&gt;because of climate change&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the US needs to regain the world’s trust and show that it means business when it comes to taking on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ04sf"&gt;“One of the things the world is very tired of is seeing the US make promises we don’t keep,” says Alden Meyer, a senior associate focused on US and international climate policy at E3G, a London-based think tank. “They want to know that whatever commitments we do make, we have not only the intention, but the wherewithal and the political support to pull off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJYgEi"&gt;Biden has made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;big promises&lt;/a&gt; already, like pledging to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2035 and reaching a “100 percent clean energy” economy by 2050. But those promises still aren’t enough to set the US on a course to meaningfully engage with the rest of the world on climate change again. Biden will need to set more near-term goals and solidify a plan to dramatically slash US greenhouse gas emissions during his time in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nicwaK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The clock is ticking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4a9TJB"&gt;The clock is ticking. During Barack Obama’s administration, the US signed onto the Paris accord and promised to slash greenhouse gas emissions between 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. That’s a goal the US is not on track to meet. The US is now expected to bring an updated commitment to the global table before a United Nations Climate Conference planned for November. Other countries &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22175698/climate-change-treaty-trump-china-eu-uk-paris-agreement-biden"&gt;ratcheted up their pledges&lt;/a&gt; last year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhA50w"&gt;The landmark Paris agreement, adopted in 2015, joined nearly every country on Earth in an effort to keep global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. The planet has already heated up by about 1.2 degrees. To keep it from warming much further, global carbon dioxide emissions will need to continually drop &lt;a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/cut-global-emissions-76-percent-every-year-next-decade-meet-15degc"&gt;by more than 7 percent each year&lt;/a&gt; until 2030. That’s about how much &lt;a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/20/files/UK_UEA-Exeter_GCB2020.pdf"&gt;emissions fell&lt;/a&gt; because of the effects of the pandemic on economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTpDlQ"&gt;In the future, those cuts need to be intentional — not the result of an unexpected health crisis. With a narrow Democratic majority in Congress, Biden hopes to pass legislation to turn some of his environmental plans into law. Climate policy will likely dovetail with pandemic relief plans. Biden has said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;millions of jobs&lt;/a&gt; will come with making America’s infrastructure more green — from building charging stations for electric vehicles to making homes and buildings more energy-efficient. The president called for $2 trillion in climate spending while on the campaign trail, but he’ll ultimately need Congress to pass a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd4Vyw"&gt;Biden will need to take action without Congress, too. He’s expected to take executive action to kill the embattled Keystone XL pipeline, for instance. There will also be an about-face at federal agencies that previously carried out Trump’s environmental rollbacks. The EPA and Department of Transportation can toughen standards for polluting facilities and vehicles. The Department of the Interior can fulfill Biden’s pledge to end new oil and gas drilling on public lands and waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89sF35"&gt;Whatever actions the US ends up taking to get its greenhouse gas emissions under control will matter for the entire planet. Currently, the US is the second biggest polluter after China. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt;, the US has released more greenhouse gases than any other country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZtVeG"&gt;The US getting serious about climate change again also puts more pressure on governments that have dragged their feet when it comes to ratcheting up climate commitments. “Many of the countries who don’t really want to take action have been using the US as the excuse to say, ‘Well, you know, the largest economy of the world has reneged,” says Carlos Fuller, international and regional liaison officer at the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center. Fuller was previously the lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. “They were really almost given free rein to not living up to their obligations [under] the Paris agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZiQNU"&gt;The US also plays a big role when it comes to funding for efforts to help countries adapt to the hazards climate change has already caused. The US has only fulfilled $1 billion out of a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund, which supports developing nations’ efforts to address climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EeqAj5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Juggling domestic policy with international climate finance and diplomacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2oKom"&gt;“It really has hampered how countries can do the adaptation measures that are required,” says Fuller. Small island nations, like those Fuller has negotiated on behalf of, have contributed far less to climate change than bigger countries. But they’ve faced devastating climate effects early on, like more severe storms and rising sea levels gobbling up their coastlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNSNGf"&gt;The cost of adapting to climate change has already reached $70 billion in developing countries and is only expected to grow, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2020"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; report. Despite the need, only $30 billion of development aid was funneled into those efforts between 2017 and 2018, the latest figures show. The US is expected to return to the world stage with funding that either meets or exceeds its previous commitment. But Biden will need the support of Congress to make that happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVXsMO"&gt;Biden’s administration has a big task ahead of juggling domestic policy with international climate finance and diplomacy. “They have to acknowledge the need for the US to be serious on all of those fronts to have credibility coming back into the Paris Agreement,” says Meyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gux56n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz8MFd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech rallies behind Biden’s immigration plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Consumers Line Up As Apple’s iPhone 11 Goes On Sale In Stores" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjTlnTF9uLHKxmJMqRZRRReRTiE=/0x0:5211x3474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697054/1169791934.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="waLAnO"&gt;Hours after taking his oath of office on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed several executive orders overturning actions taken by the Trump administration regarding immigration, and tech is rallying behind the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RhLor"&gt;Biden signed two executive orders Wednesday that extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for another four years and overturn the Trump administration’s travel bans on largely Muslim-majority countries. It’s just the start of the Biden administration’s immigration reform efforts. The administration also plans to drop a new bill that would &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;provide 11 million undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; with a pathway to citizenship and an eight-year waiting period before they can become permanent residents, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/biden-immigration-plans-459766"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="653IWB"&gt;“We welcome President Biden’s commitment to pursuing comprehensive immigration reform that reflects the American values of justice, fairness and dignity. This effort will strengthen American communities and the pathways to opportunity this country has long fostered,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement Wednesday. “In the weeks and months to come, business leaders look forward to working with the Administration, as well as Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to achieve bipartisan, practical and comprehensive solutions to fix our broken immigration system, including a permanent solution for Dreamers that includes a path to citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5bPgBZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We applaud &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;'s quick action on COVID relief, the Paris Climate Accord, and immigration reform. Google has supported action on these important issues &amp;amp; we look forward to working with the new administration to help the US recover from the pandemic + grow our economy.&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1352021111479832576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UChP9a"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai also put out a statement in support of the Biden administration’s new immigration effort. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We applaud @POTUS‘s quick action on COVID relief, the Paris Climate Accord, and immigration reform. Google has supported action on these important issues &amp;amp; we look forward to working with the new administration to help the US recover from the pandemic + grow our economy,” Pichai said in a tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDj5rB"&gt;“We are thankful that President Biden and Vice President Harris are following through on their commitment to send a bill to Congress to fix our broken immigration system,” FWD.us president Todd Schulte said in a statement Wednesday. “What needs to happen in short order is the House and Senate must move legislation that is signed into law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAtYuB"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg helped found FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi3cbH"&gt;Twitter also put out a statement in support of the move. The “DACA Executive Order signed this evening delivers hope for #Dreamers. Diversity makes the US, our company, and our world better,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1352024397591289856?s=20"&gt;the company said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzWMLD"&gt;Last summer, former President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending a number of visa programs, including guest worker visas, like the H-1B. Tech companies commonly use these visas to recruit talented employees from overseas. After this proclamation was issued, tech companies, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300573/h1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299812/trump-guest-worker-h1-b-visa-google-tech-itic-internet-association"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, put out statements admonishing the Trump administration’s guest worker ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8At6mr"&gt;In the past, tech companies have argued that comprehensive immigration reform would benefit the US economy, largely focusing on how to improve visas for the high-skilled workers these companies employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0yax"&gt;TechNet, a technology trade group, signed onto a National Immigration Forum &lt;a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Statement-in-Support-of-Bipartisan-Immigration-Reform-1_19_2021.pdf"&gt;letter to Congress&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday encouraging members to quickly approve the Biden administration’s immigration plans. Dozens of TechNet’s members also signed onto the letter, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCjP9B"&gt;“We can create a modern, humane, and effective immigration system that upholds the best of America’s promise: to be a nation where people can come from around the world to work, contribute, and build a better life for themselves, their families, and our society as a whole,” the TechNet letter said. “As we recover from COVID-19, the essential contributions of immigrants here today, and those to come tomorrow, will be critical to the health and well-being of American workers and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdb2QT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXBsap"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Muppet Great Gatsby exists — in script form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6jRC3xE3TIQ8oXJjPHgPDk5OTM=/50x0:610x373/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696943/Kermit_Suit.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RjFLK"&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/31/22205532/the-great-gatsby-public-domain-the-muppets-adaptation-disney"&gt;desperate plea&lt;/a&gt; for a Muppets adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; has been answered: documentary filmmaker &lt;a href="http://benjamincrew.weebly.com/about-me.html"&gt;Ben Crew&lt;/a&gt; has taken the public domain novel and turned it into &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oi3aqaPQA6g2ThZoJ5eqfcj6BpksOQ71/view"&gt;a downloadable 104-page fan-made script&lt;/a&gt; that marries Muppet antics with existential angst. My request for an adaptation may have been ridiculous, but this script seriously vindicates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxNEAG"&gt;Crew’s script, “Muppets Present ‘The Great Gatsby,’” may be a silly mashup of a novel you’re forced to read in high school and a puppet comedy variety show, but he said it became a meaningful project when January’s news cycle became too much to bear. “I knew that there was nothing I could do about what was happening in D.C. and that if I didn’t distract myself I was just going to waste away in front of the news again,” Crew wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s when I dedicated myself to writing this script.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rRe49gvGs66iyDDfmNTEf0SghYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248029/MuppetGreatGatsby.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Benjamin Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of the Muppet adaptations poster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xb2ksB"&gt;The final product is a script that plays to a lot of the Muppets’ strengths, while tossing in some fun additions original to Crew. Miss Piggy does karate, Gonzo and Fozzie Bear break the fourth wall frequently, and Kermit... well, Kermit is as exactly as good-natured as we expect. Since every good Muppets movie needs human characters, Crew imagines casting Tom Holland as narrator Nick Carraway and Taron Egerton as the abusive Tom Buchanan. The script also leans frequently into the meta-humor The Muppets is known for and, of course, features plenty of musical numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KYSW4"&gt;Crew pulled on his knowledge of The Muppets to write the script, which he says he built over years, bonding with his older brother over VHS tapes of &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt;. That personal connection and a belief that there’s something genuinely, morally good about the characters made the script feel like an antidote to the anxiety that was ailing Crew. And based on the positive responses to his Reddit post sharing the script, it helped others, too. You can read an excerpt from the full script below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1i7cCU"&gt;NICK CARRAWAY (CONT’D) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r80lTT"&gt;I wonder what kind of a man Mr. Gatsby is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tITJdl"&gt;GONZO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpSHf6"&gt;Technically he’s a frog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5PIw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick’s eyes zero in on the massive windows of Gatsby’s home. A lone curtain is drawn open, could someone be watching? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GlIJC"&gt;NICK CARRAWAY (V.O.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SwxCi"&gt;All this money, all this property - but are you in there alone right now, do you have anyone to share it with? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O32dc3"&gt;RIZZO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gAUF3"&gt;He’s inner monologuing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGLqOX"&gt;GONZO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrEbQL"&gt;Just unpack, we’ll snap him out of it if he’s still going by dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vwkD8X"&gt;So the wheels are in motion. There’s &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oi3aqaPQA6g2ThZoJ5eqfcj6BpksOQ71/view"&gt;a script written&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/KqGxPdj.png"&gt;a poster made&lt;/a&gt;, and a new subreddit (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/muppetsgreatgatsby/"&gt;r/muppetgreatgatsby&lt;/a&gt;) devoted to the project. Disney could step in and make things official at some point, but we’ve gotten pretty far on sheer willpower and ridiculous demands alone, so let’s make another: we need this script to be made into a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inauguration Day was more accessible than ever, but there’s still a ways to go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Black woman in uniform stands at a podium, holding up her hands in the middle of signing." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQASgshr54Ls3BlU2AdItt-hT6U=/0x0:3756x2504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696766/1230695751.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhrnY0"&gt;Firefighter Andrea Hall put accessible communication front and center at the presidential inauguration today when she led the Pledge of Allegiance in both spoken English and Signed English. The inaugural committee also hosted several separate accessible live streams of the event on its YouTube page, including one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cctCd8jI0e8"&gt;audio description&lt;/a&gt;, one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5-dkVhOQRRQ"&gt;live captions and American Sign Language interpretation&lt;/a&gt;, and one with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XyHeDfMgjEc"&gt;Cued Speech transliteration&lt;/a&gt; (the use of hand shapes to signal speech sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nffV7y"&gt;But despite those efforts,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many deaf and hard of hearing viewers still found the inauguration inaccessible. Most broadcast stations didn’t have an ASL interpreter on-screen and used automated captions, which are notoriously inaccurate. In what some saw as a particularly frustrating move, several live streams switched to a wide shot of the crowd in the middle of Hall’s signing of the pledge, cutting off the only portion of the event during which signing appeared at center stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3zDyZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CNN also cut away from this to show the crowd. So, we still have some work to do to get people to understand accessibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT it was good to see accessibility included in the inauguration. I hope that Biden will continue to push for positive changes for disabled Americans. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PnaPUZ7t0q"&gt;https://t.co/PnaPUZ7t0q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steven Spohn (Spawn) (@stevenspohn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1351951624445505536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUnq4V"&gt;Although the “&lt;a href="https://bideninaugural.org/accessibility/"&gt;Accessible Inauguration&lt;/a&gt;” page was a change of pace for those who’ve grown used to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;being excluded from these kinds of events, many people didn’t know to look there for the appropriate stream. Both the audio description and Cued Speech transliteration streams were unlisted on YouTube, meaning you’d have to know to go to that page to get the links for them. Throughout the event, people on Twitter asked where they could find a stream with an ASL interpreter or expressed frustration that there were no interpreters at the event.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXTQIl"&gt;The reliability of the official interpreted streams was also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spotty in some cases. There were several stretches of time when the picture-in-picture of the ASL interpreter disappeared from the screen, leaving chunks of speech inaccessible. The most consistently interpreted stream was the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrBiden/status/1351907173660413953"&gt;Inaugural Celebration for Young Americans&lt;/a&gt;” hosted by Keke Palmer, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/parents/first-ever-inauguration-day-program-young-americans-t206199"&gt;specifically directed at children&lt;/a&gt;, and deaf adults shouldn’t have to rely on programming for kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOSbRU"&gt;The new administration’s prioritization of accessibility is an exciting step, and the availability of such a variety of accessible sources is a big deal for many disabled Americans. But there’s still work to be done to ensure accessible options are reliable and easily available across all platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s speaker-packed Google Nest Hub alternative is $220 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idk28GWHYdFQooQtoH6DsUXVgW4=/0x267:1600x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696687/s_l1600.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVho47"&gt;JBL’s Google Assistant-powered smart display, the Link View, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252F154193201978%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergegooddeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241056%2Fjbl-link-view-google-assistant-smart-display-ebay-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt; on Harman Audio’s (JBL’s parent company) eBay store. While its original price was $300, this smart display has been slowly getting cheaper since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2018/8/1/17640698/jbl-link-view-google-smart-display-speaker-release-date"&gt;it debuted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Both the black and white color variants are on sale, and it comes with free standard shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn5zSg"&gt;The JBL Link View smart display features an 8-inch touchscreen display with a webcam built into the device. Although it has been on the market for several years, time has been kind to this smart display. And &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/jn538v/jbl_link_view_updated_with_the_new_interface/"&gt;Reddit users have pointed&lt;/a&gt; out that the Link View recently received an update, which includes a new user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HLwOWH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10294136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPGqEi"&gt;For the price, JBL’s smart display seems like a great value that delivers more features (and likely better sound performance) than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s 7-inch Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t tested it side-by-side with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;10-inch Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;, but privacy-minded people might like the fact that JBL’s device has a hardware camera shutter, which Google’s lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RZmGKU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitch has ‘indefinitely’ banned Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVJnA6Vy5Cy1qAdS9JHpgcJIzZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696575/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdjP2z"&gt;Twitch has “indefinitely” banned former President Donald Trump from its platform. The action comes two weeks after the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;disabled Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;, preventing him from streaming but leaving the account page live, in light of the mob attack on the Capitol. At the time, a company spokesperson told a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter that it would reassess his account after he left office — which happened today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzNXWX"&gt;“We have indefinitely suspended President Trump’s Twitch channel due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence,” a Twitch spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="f055FH"&gt;The President’s statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public. Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions. However, the events of the past weeks have highlighted a gap with respect to rhetoric that encourages violence, regardless of whether or not it was directly streamed on Twitch. We will be updating our policies as a result of our consideration of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xXmV7c"&gt;This kind of suspension means that Trump will have &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/about-account-suspensions-dmca-suspensions-and-chat-bans?language=en_US"&gt;no opportunity to appeal the ban&lt;/a&gt; on his account, and it also means that he cannot create another account there unless his suspension is lifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQL2hw"&gt;Twitch’s action follows others taken by social media platforms like Twitter — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned Trump for inciting violence after the Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt; — though it is the first platform to take action against Trump since his term ended today. Twitch initially issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;a temporary ban&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s account in June 2020 for broadcasting “hateful conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhiteHouse.gov now has dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the White House website, showing the dark, high contrast mode activated." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKVZ56Tusr2DG23Nb-8RLmxd7XA=/53x0:2231x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695583/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.26.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpyu7d"&gt;The official website of the White House, &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, has been completely replaced with a new version for the Biden administration, and it comes with some unexpected accessibility features: a high contrast mode, which serves as a dark mode, and a toggle to make the font size larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fy08"&gt;Both options show up along the left rail as big, easy-to-click or tap buttons, and that’s the way you’ll need to toggle them. Even if your device has a system-wide dark mode, the White House website won’t switch over automatically. That’s because it’s really there to serve as an accessibility feature, meant to help anyone who would have trouble reading or looking at a bright white screen with black text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lszlCD"&gt;With dark mode being very popular among heavy computer users as well, people online were understandably excited to see the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="traket"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE WHITEHOUSE WEBSITE HAS DARK MODE I’M LOSING IT. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7kXlBhUXeJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7kXlBhUXeJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sara Ownbey Chipps (@SaraJChipps) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaraJChipps/status/1351942085952352260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiU2dn"&gt;The large text mode — no surprises — makes the text on the site significantly larger, while still preserving the layout, something that may not be true when using a browser’s built-in zoom ability. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The White House site showing with a dark background, large buttons and text" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/di7-VoZuqQ1ssqFH2UuGjSD49QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247885/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.31.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site in both high contrast and large text mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ0jUs"&gt;Acting as a recruiting tool for anyone who’s looking into the site’s code, the HTML header also makes a callout to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;the US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;. The group, led by a former Google engineer, is tasked with making sure US government websites are as good as any of the other ones we visit on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A zoomed-in screenshot showing the high-contrast and large font size toggle buttons" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edOHhO4Vr1p3JZreY9jzQExEOVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247932/bidens_buttons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are the buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TSQ7SU"&gt;While the previous &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt; site wasn’t a trainwreck by any means (at least technically speaking), it’s good to see that the new administration is taking accessibility and digital competency seriously from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pOyaoY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;US Digital Service is a really big deal to help rebuild the country &lt;a href="https://t.co/B527dWpDr1"&gt;https://t.co/B527dWpDr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— craig newmark (@craignewmark) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/craignewmark/status/1351939985474260997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bKiOBM"&gt;The site also has an addition to help with inclusivity — &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/"&gt;the “Contact Us” form&lt;/a&gt; now asks the user for their preferred pronouns. The change was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glaad/status/1351974350853967876"&gt;spotted by GLAAD&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully speaks to a trend with the current administration. Vice President Kamala Harris also includes her pronouns in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris"&gt;her personal Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt; (though they aren’t yet in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP"&gt;her @VP bio&lt;/a&gt;,) which is something that we haven’t yet seen from a president or vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dropdown menu on the White House contact page that allows the user to select their pronouns." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEikKW5TWFG9KgmCInMwoxXWjaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248366/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_12.04.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new pronoun menu on the contact page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u1NcxG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 3:28PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the website’s contact form now also allows the user to input their preferred pronouns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9l2ZV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 3:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Kamala Harris having her pronouns in her Twitter bio is a first for the office of the president or vice president.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today, the US welcomed a new president and new Bernie memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQvc69FeJ0LftAQefxGotvawJ3Y=/0x17:1096x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696431/EsMWA4aW4AIwkUE.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21cO1c"&gt;Today’s US presidential inauguration brought many good things, but the thing Twitter seems most excited about is a new crop of Bernie memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m7bZi"&gt;The meme started with a wire photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), sitting on a folding chair watching President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The temperature in Washington, DC was in the 40s, so he’s bundled up with a coat and mittens, and he’s sitting socially distanced from everyone else, as his age and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hospital.html"&gt;prior health issues&lt;/a&gt; put him at severe risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGEbbH"&gt;Something about Sanders’ chilly body language, his oversized wool mittens, and the fact that he was sitting entirely alone made the photo irresistible as meme material. Of course, the senator is no stranger to memes — including 2016’s Birdie Sanders and 2020’s “I am once again asking” — but this one has blown up particularly quickly. Take a look for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bernie’s mittens are made by Jen Ellis, a teacher from Essex Junction, Vt. She gave them to him 2+ years ago and was surprised when he began wearing them on the campaign trail. They are made from repurposed wool sweaters and lined with fleece made from recycled plastic bottles. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ErLr29lY2t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ErLr29lY2t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rubycramer/status/1351915535647330306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Amazon offers to help Biden administration with vaccinations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuoNCGF2wk_IfHjm8sh0d3tZ8iU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696294/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtIIvD"&gt;Amazon has offered to help the Biden administration meet its goal of completing 100 million coronavirus vaccinations within the next 100 days. “Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s worldwide operations leader, wrote in a letter to the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvVhto"&gt;The company’s main interest appears to be in offering vaccinations through its own facilities. Clark writes that Amazon has “an agreement in place” with a health care provider to administer vaccinations on site, though he did not say which Amazon facilities were being considered. The company operates warehouses, Amazon-branded shops, and Whole Foods grocery stores. Clark said Amazon could “move quickly once vaccines are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ry93yR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObHdtT"&gt;Amazon could also provide technology and communications resources to help the new administration, Clark said. “We are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration’s vaccination efforts,” Clark wrote in the letter addressed to Biden. The letter was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/amazoncom-vaccine/amazon-offers-to-help-u-s-with-vaccine-in-letter-to-president-biden-idUSL1N2JV294"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TocQbE"&gt;Among the challenges of getting the US vaccinated is completing the “last mile” of distribution — getting the vaccines from distributors to patients. Pfizer and Moderna’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;vaccines need to be transported while frozen&lt;/a&gt;, with Pfizer’s requiring ultra-cold storage. Once they get to a facility, they need to be thawed and quickly distributed. Lately, distribution efforts in the US have been complicated by confusion over who’s eligible and fractured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;access to vaccine sign-ups and appointments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDUpnG"&gt;Amazon, of course, has one of the most expansive distribution systems in the United States, designed to rapidly ship packages from warehouses across the country. The offer marks a stark contrast to Amazon’s relationship with the previous administration, which was strained by former President Donald Trump’s ongoing grudge against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Trump also took a fairly hands-off approach to federal involvement in vaccine distribution, largely leaving states responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
