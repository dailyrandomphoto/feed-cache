    <title>Put Baby Yoda on your wrist with Vodafone and Disney’s Neo smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMPc4e_rqCPanLh6k1-Bc6sIAIA=/141x0:831x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68427783/Tablet_L_460x1844_TheChild.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S11oSF"&gt;European mobile carrier Vodafone has partnered with Disney to launch a new wearable for kids called &lt;a href="https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/vodafone-unveils-neo-the-game-changing-smart-watch-designed-for-kids-and-featuring-iconic-characters-from-disney-pixar-marvel-and-star-wars/"&gt;the Neo&lt;/a&gt;. Vodafone says the Neo combines its technological capabilities with Disney’s entertainment chops to offer a wearable that gives kids a sense of independence while letting parents stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUL28t"&gt;The Neo’s most notable feature is its Disney branding. The Yves Béhar-designed watch lets kids choose from a collection of “Sidekicks” that will hang out on the main clock screen, including The Child / Baby Yoda / Grogu from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, Buzz Lightyear from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and Minnie Mouse. Vodafone says the Sidekicks will animate throughout the day, and the company plans to add more characters over time at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgVeLJ8M96k5GiI0TNnLACTmlzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137589/1300x910_uk.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Neo smartwatch with the Vodafone Smart app for controlling privacy settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgtV38"&gt;Besides the injection of Disney charm, the Neo is mostly focused on keeping parents in touch with their kids, with a few added smartwatch features (though all of this requires a Vodafone subscription). With the watch, parents can call, text, and get updates on their kid’s location from the companion Vodafone Smart app. Parents can use the same app to create a “circle” of trusted contacts for texting and calling and limit screen time with Quiet Mode. To boost kid’s “independence,” the Neo can also receive calendar updates, check the weather, track activity, and take photos with a built-in 5-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F012Ev"&gt;Wearables for kids are not a new category, and plenty of other mobile carriers like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Ftimex-familyconnect%3Fsku%3D610214661166&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fverizon-gizmowatch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; offer takes on the idea. Even Apple has gotten into the game with Family Setup in watchOS 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;we looked at earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with smartwatches for kids are twofold: parents have to decide how much of their child’s privacy they’re willing to sacrifice to keep them safe, and usually, these watches aren’t very great in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWeov"&gt;Vodafone says the Neo won’t be released in Europe until early 2021, where it should retail for £99 with £7-a-month subscription. If the Neo’s specific Disney wrapper piques your family’s interest, you can &lt;a href="https://eshop.v.vodafone.com/uk/neo-smart-kids-watch"&gt;sign up for the waitlist today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massachusetts on the verge of becoming first state to ban police use of facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5hGYXzqYEPnuFqGLR7TNh5-vcI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68426471/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmNbEl"&gt;Massachusetts lawmakers this week voted to ban the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and public agencies in a sweeping police reform bill that received significant bipartisan support. If signed into law, Massachusetts would become the first state to fully ban the technology, following bans barring the &lt;a href="https://securitytoday.com/articles/2019/10/10/california-to-become-third-state-to-ban-facial-recognition-software-in-police-body-cameras.aspx"&gt;use of facial recognition in police body cameras&lt;/a&gt; and other, more limited city-specific bans on the tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQhBsY"&gt;The bill, &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020"&gt;S.2963&lt;/a&gt;, marks yet another state government tackling the thorny ethical issue of unregulated facial recognition use in the absence of any federal guidance from Congress. It also includes bans on chokeholds and rubber bullets in addition to restrictions on tear gas and other crowd-control weapons, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It isn’t a blanket ban on facial recognition; police will still be able to run searches against the state’s driver’s license database but only with a warrant and requirements that law enforcement agencies publish annual transparency reports regarding those searches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGzTYZ"&gt;Massachusetts joins cities like Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon, as well as San Francisco and Oakland in Northern California, that have banned police use of facial recognition. Earlier this year, Boston became the first major East Coast city to &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban"&gt;bar police from purchasing and using facial recognition services&lt;/a&gt;, but the Massachusetts bill goes a step further in making the ban statewide. S.2963 passed 28-12 in the state senate and 92-67 in the Massachusetts House of Representatives on Tuesday, and it now awaits signing from Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="54wMrl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Massachusetts’ bill institutes a statewide ban on police use of facial recognition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1NNic"&gt;Use of facial recognition has become a controversial topic in the artificial intelligence industry and the broader tech policy sphere because of a lack of federal guidance regulating its use. That vacuum has allowed a number of companies — most prominently controversial firm Clearview AI — to step in and offer services to governments, law enforcement agencies, private companies, and even individuals, often without any oversight or records as to how it’s used and whether it’s even accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfb1du"&gt;In August, Clearview AI — which has sold access to its software and its database of billions of images, scraped in part from social media sites to numerous government agencies and private companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;signed a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. (In May, Clearview said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its tech to private companies&lt;/a&gt; following a lawsuit brought against it for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which, prior to these more recent city bans, was the only piece of US legislation regulating facial regulation use.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYRA3e"&gt;A number of researchers have been sounding the alarm for years now that modern facial recognition, even when aided by advanced AI, can be flawed. Systems like Rekognition have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;have issues identifying the gender of darker-skinned individuals&lt;/a&gt; and suffer from other racial bias built into how the databases are constructed and how the models are trained on that data. Amazon in June &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;banned police from using its facial recognition platform for one year&lt;/a&gt;, with the company saying it wants to give Congress “enough time to implement appropriate rules” governing the sale and use of the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZjfMg"&gt;Amazon was following the lead of IBM, which announced that same month it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software"&gt;no longer develop the technology whatsoever&lt;/a&gt; after acknowledging criticism from researchers and activists over its potential use in racial profiling, mass surveillance, and other civil rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>God of War’s Kratos is coming to battle his way through the Fortnite universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvBJkxsNTcbb5IuHxx_TD0c8PEY=/116x0:1336x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68426194/EoQSbyPXEAMV1ze.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VJGq3B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to tie-ins — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;the battle royale’s season 5 battle pass&lt;/a&gt; has already kicked off with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;picture-perfect Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; and Baby Yoda skin, for example — but its next character appears to be coming not from a popular film or movie franchise, but from a different video game universe: &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s Kratos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFGcH7"&gt;The image, first posted by noted leaker HYPEX on Twitter, depicted a version of the Ghost of Sparta (in his more recent, bearded form from 2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;), albeit with a softer animated style look that’s more in line with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IKTHpf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Kratos will be a skin soon! (Reposted for a better image) &lt;a href="https://t.co/S6lgYMcGJR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/S6lgYMcGJR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HYPEX (@HYPEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1334211805422505984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FA6B1b"&gt;Another tease from the PlayStation account further hints at Kratos’ pending arrival, with an unseen character panicking about “the next guy you’re picking up has literally vanquished multiple gods with his bare hands in a fit of uncontrollable rage” — a description that matches Kratos to a T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZupV3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Incoming audio transmission from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/SdpmU7OmkM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SdpmU7OmkM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1334210728602054658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ngxWt"&gt;The current season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHsdYu8RRSI"&gt;features multiple “hunters”&lt;/a&gt; from different realities that have been brought to the island in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;universe-shattering fight with Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. In that vein, Kratos seems to fit right in. That said, as one of Sony’s marquee first-party characters, it is a little jarring to see that Kratos will be joining a third-party game that exists on nearly every gaming platform like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46ERbN"&gt;It’s not clear yet when the Kratos skin will be available, if it’ll be something that players will have to purchase or can earn in-game, or even if it’ll be available to players on platforms other than the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5. But with Sony’s official account already teasing the character, we likely won’t have long to wait before a more formal announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s Watch Party feature is now available to all subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJUXD2sBHE7TBjOkcmsFyDZQzQc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68418404/Happiest_Season_Hulu_Watch_Party.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbCyze"&gt;Hulu was first among the major streaming services to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273246/hulu-watch-party-feature-how-to-use-test"&gt;a way for multiple people to watch its shows and movies together&lt;/a&gt; at the same time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, that Watch Party feature is expanding to all subscribers — not just those people paying for the ad-free plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZdBe6"&gt;Watch Party is available on Hulu’s website. You’ll see the icon on a title’s details page. From there, you can share a Watch Party link with up to seven other Hulu subscribers so that everyone can watch the same content together from afar. Hulu says that “while watching, group members will be able to react in real-time through the chat function and control their own playback.” If you find yourself having to pause while your friends keep watching, there’s a “click to catch up” button to get right back to the same spot as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9q7hu"&gt;You can use Watch Party with “thousands” of titles from Hulu’s on-demand library, including the company’s new original rom-com film &lt;em&gt;The Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;, which Hulu says broke streaming records when it premiered over Thanksgiving weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6H0LK"&gt;A number of third-party co-watch apps rose in popularity during the early quarantine phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432411/disney-plus-watch-party-feature-test-canada-scener-netflix-amazon-prime-video"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345413/movies-anywhere-viewing-party-feature-watch-together-screen-pass-lending-app"&gt;Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt; have begun offering their own built-in solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s FPV racing drone looks mighty real in these leaked photos</title>
    <content type="html">

In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;it merely dipped a toe&lt;/a&gt; — but a little over a year later, it looks like the company is nearly ready to announce a racing drone after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rzzgm"&gt;You’re now looking at leaked images of what appears to be called the “DJI FPV,” and it certainly doesn’t look like any drone the company’s released before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2BH5JU"&gt;Without any hard specs or even the barest idea of price, it’s tough to judge what we’re looking at, but the three-blade propellers, sizable hump, and minimalist controller are all a departure from the company’s many previous drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIcsB3"&gt;That makes sense, since FPV racing and filming focuses on speed over all else. You’ll generally tilt your entire drone far beyond the angle you’d tilt a traditional filmmaking drone to maximize your forward momentum — and when you do, you need a camera that primarily tilts up, not down. And if you’re going to be wearing an FPV headset all the time (it appears to come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;the DJI FPV Goggles&lt;/a&gt;), you don’t really need a holder for your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu2pf9"&gt;These leaks all come by way of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV"&gt;OsitaLV on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/02/dji-fpv-drone-leaks-in-latest-images-release-near/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who has a reputation for finding out DJI’s news before it’s official. Most recently, OsitaLV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1317291858251350017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;shared images and details&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;DJI Pocket 2&lt;/a&gt; four days before it was announced. They also recently shared an image &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/11/24/leaked-photo-mavic-pro-3/"&gt;of a possible Mavic Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQMY1"&gt;Early last month, DJI’s Brendan Schulman teased that the company might still have another product announcement this year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPjCMl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DJI released six new products in the past three weeks. Surely, everyone feels we must be done for the year. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e9xet6LheP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e9xet6LheP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brendan Schulman (@dronelaws) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws/status/1324492559863996416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zP1YrL"&gt;Perhaps this is it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reportedly will sell its flying taxi business to secretive startup Joby Aviation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1CnwT2qnlVzkZgx6bm1VaoeJ_8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68409894/ECRM003_hero_shot__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66QegU"&gt;Uber’s ambitious and quixotic effort to launch a flying taxi service is coming in for a landing. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-190158b9-9753-4f6d-a857-39f93af93222.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ride-hailing company has agreed to sell its Uber Elevate division to secretive startup Joby Aviation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKMiEp"&gt;The news comes as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi attempts to push his company closer to profitability, which includes the sale of the money-losing parts of the business. The company is also said to be exploring the sale of its autonomous vehicle division. A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QVLhG"&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434580/uber-flying-car-elevate-self-driving-vtol"&gt;a white paper published in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Under Uber’s calculations, a two-hour, 12-minute slog from San Francisco to San Jose would become a breezy 15 minutes by flying car. A two-hour, 10-minute battle through São Paulo gridlock would be transformed into an 18-minute pleasure ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XKWkK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in a white paper published in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50s2RI"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655126/uber-copter-new-york-city-jfk-airport-elevate-helicopter-flying-taxi-price"&gt;Uber starting offering helicopter trips&lt;/a&gt; from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The trips were meant to offer a taste of what the experience would be like to use the Uber app to summon a flight rather than a car ride, and the company certainly saw it as an opportunity to gather data for its air taxi plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa1s2A"&gt;Those plans were ambitious, and perhaps doomed, from the start. It relied on a technology — electric-powered aviation — that was still under development and had yet to be tested as part of a commercial service. And it would have been costly to implement, requiring the construction of a vast network of rooftop or ground-level “skyports” and regulatory approval from a host of federal, state, and local agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgnKkZ"&gt;The choice of Joby Aviation as buyer makes sense. In December 2019, the ride-hailing company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029943/uber-joby-aviation-flying-car-air-taxi-2023"&gt;join forces with the Northern California-based aerospace company&lt;/a&gt;, which has been working on electric aircraft for over a decade. Joby was the first company to commit to Uber’s aggressive timetable to launch a flying taxi service by 2023. A spokesperson for Joby declined to comment as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UteFAA"&gt;Joby is the brainchild of inventor JoeBen Bevirt, who started the company in 2009 and operated it in relative obscurity until 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959698/joby-aviation-evtol-100-million-investment"&gt;Joby announced&lt;/a&gt; it had raised a surprising $100 million from a variety of investors, including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota, and JetBlue. The money helped finance the development of the company’s air taxi prototype, which has been conducting test flights at Joby’s private airfield in Northern California. Bevirt helps run an incubator outside of Santa Cruz that’s been described as a &lt;a href="https://pando.com/2013/07/03/the-startup-ranch-of-santa-cruz/"&gt;quasi-commune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDzeEe"&gt;Unlike the dozens of other companies that are currently building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Joby has kept much of its project under wraps. The few renderings that are out there show a plane-drone hybrid with 12 rotors and room in the cabin for four passengers, though a spokesperson previously cautioned that what Joby is working on now is “entirely new.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqOzDF"&gt;The company lifted the curtain in January 2020, when it announced it had closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;massive $590 million round of venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;. Joby also announced that it was teaming up with previous investor Toyota to launch an air taxi service using its new aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTaE7"&gt;The all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shift into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200 mph, travel 150 miles on a single charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFrwdA"&gt;Of course, many companies — Joby included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal figh&lt;/a&gt;t with its former investor, Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggbpN3"&gt;The jury is still out on whether an electric vertical takeoff and landing-based air taxi system would make an appreciable contribution to a next-generation transportation system, or whether it would simply be an escape hatch for the super-rich to avoid street-level traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEdmCp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Galaxy Buds Pro image reveals new rounded design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgCgNHVtNnOgxTnlkTS6TNO0u8I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68388280/galaxy_buds_pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdq2P"&gt;An image of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds has leaked, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1"&gt;noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nokmco"&gt;You can see the apparent image of the headphones at the top of this post. They look to have a more rounded shape than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an image of what the Galaxy Buds Plus look like, for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cBqOZS"&gt;Blass also posted a render that apparently shows the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro — a render looks similar to a diagram of the case found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726569/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-fcc-regulatory-filing"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; for the Galaxy Buds Pro. Instead of the more oblong shape of the case for the Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds Plus, the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro looks to be more of a square with rounded corners, like the one for Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the Galaxy Buds Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsuHss"&gt;A new shape and new case aren’t the only new updates reportedly coming to the Galaxy Buds Pro — they may also have active noise cancellation and improvements to ambient mode, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-buds-with-galaxy-s21-details/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to be revealed alongside the Galaxy S21 phones in January, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supergiant just released a 10th anniversary album of music from its games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LgzRUG34xr2Kdrpx2fr-5rYXhjo=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68387628/zagreus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Na4o18"&gt;Studio Supergiant Games has been in the business of making excellent games for the last decade — including &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pyre&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which each have received something like universal acclaim from critics and fans alike. Part of what makes those games so special is their soundtracks, composed by Darren Korb. And now Korb’s work is getting its own standalone anniversary release in the form of the record &lt;em&gt;The Songs of Supergiant Games: 10th Anniversary Orchestral Collection. &lt;/em&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://store.supergiantgames.com/products/the-songs-of-supergiant-games-10th-anniversary-collection-vinyl-standard-edition"&gt;preorder the (translucent red!) vinyl now for shipping in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, or you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUHvI4dgY8w"&gt;listen to the whole thing on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Supergiant Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDnmHa"&gt;The album was recorded at the hallowed Abbey Road Studios in London, and each track has a unique orchestral arrangement conducted by &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; composer Austin Wintory. Supergiant released a behind-the-scenes look at the recording process on its YouTube channel, which you can peep here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google illegally spied on workers before firing them, US labor board alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DOUNIAMAG-BRITAIN-IRELAND-US-INTERNET-SEXISM-COMPANY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9SrPTFVkBDFXXpI0DSVsKH98Vs=/0x0:5275x3517/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68381034/1056016666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p2PTlH"&gt;Google violated US labor laws by spying on workers who were organizing employee protests, then firing two of them, according to a complaint to be filed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VABe0z"&gt;The complaint names two employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, both of whom were fired by the company in late 2019 in connection with employee activism. Berland was organizing against Google’s decision to work with IRI Consultants, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;a firm widely known for its anti-union efforts&lt;/a&gt;, when he was let go for reviewing other employees’ calendars. Now, the NLRB has found Google’s policy against employees looking at certain coworkers’ calendars is unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jU542"&gt;“Google’s hiring of IRI is an unambiguous declaration that management will no longer tolerate worker organizing,” Berland said in a statement. “Management and their union busting cronies wanted to send that message, and the NLRB is now sending their own message: worker organizing is protected by law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otelr5"&gt;Spiers was fired after she created a pop-up for Google employees visiting the IRI Consultants website. “Googlers have the right to participate in protected concerted activities,” the notification read, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/fifth-google-worker-activist-fired-in-a-month-says-company-is-targeting-the-vulnerable"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company said Spiers had violated security policies, a statement that hurt her reputation in the tech community. Now, the NLRB has found the firing was unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaHZL2"&gt;“This week the NLRB issued a complaint on my behalf. They found that I was illegally terminated for trying to help my colleagues,” Spiers said. “Colleagues and strangers believe I abused my role because of lies told by Google management while they were retaliating against me. The NLRB can order Google to reinstate me, but it cannot reverse the harm done to my credibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3sMtc"&gt;Google, once known as the happiest company in tech, has been roiled in scandal in recent years. The company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;paid former executive Andy Rubin $90 million&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a sexual harassment investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;which set off a wave of protests at offices across the globe&lt;/a&gt;. More than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees and contractors&lt;/a&gt; participated in the walkouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD4WcJ"&gt;Workers have also protested the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;work with the Department of Defense on Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, an AI initiative that could help the US improve its drone strike capabilities. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;more than 3,100 employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; urging CEO Sundar Pichai to pull out of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhvXnG"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees. Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube expands its Premieres feature with trailers and live redirects</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6tdQkA"&gt;YouTube is building on its Premieres feature — used for live-streaming pre-recorded videos — by adding support for trailers, redirects from live pre-shows, and customized countdown timers. The company says there’s been an 85 percent growth in the daily use of the feature from over 8 million channels, and these additions might make Premieres useful in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubReQK"&gt;Premieres was designed to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490456/youtube-pre-recorded-videos-livestream-vidcon-2018"&gt;some of the benefits of YouTube live streams&lt;/a&gt; like live chat, but with the control of a pre-recorded and edited video. Creators typically use it to watch and respond to their subscribers while new videos debut. But as the pandemic has pushed film festivals and conventions online, Premieres’ use cases have grown. These new changes attempt to build on that momentum as online events become the norm by catering to some of the structure and marketing of traditional live events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MKQY6jpgUYBT3lBm6nmGr9nc04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137126/YTblog_BTSRedCarpet_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z0AGmC"&gt;The first of the new features is Live Redirect, which allows a creator with a premiere to hold a live stream prior to the video going live and automatically redirect viewers to it once it starts. YouTube imagines this filling the role of a pre-show or red carpet so viewers can learn and get excited about an upcoming video immediately before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIco6cU1ck0oXELaP7UqNSqXQ8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137138/YTblog_SetReminder_ClashRoyale_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3mpOzS"&gt;The new optional Trailers are designed to fill in another pre-Premieres space, this time by looping a 15-second to three-minute video on an upcoming premiere’s watch page. Trailers could be used to advertise an upcoming premiere and entice potential viewers to set a reminder to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esSVKL7PDsawMfFPXinDvXpTAiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137140/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wC7D51"&gt;The final new addition is the ability to customize the countdown timer that plays before a premiere with a Countdown Theme. YouTube says creators will be able to choose from a variety of “themes, vibes, and moods” so that the timer better matches the content of the video, rather than YouTube’s default style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oodeCd"&gt;YouTube says Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators today, with Countdown Themes available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
