    <title>Go watch how Marvel’s FX team created a new ‘visual language’ for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoDZ3J_dFx93ybYtWUrGeUgJ4ac=/189x0:1044x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69257256/falcon_blue_screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Anthony Mackie as Falcon | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ2ImdWPM-c&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCuAtu"&gt;Now that &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; has wrapped and we’re still a few weeks away from the debut of &lt;em&gt;Loki, &lt;/em&gt;Marvel has released a behind-the-scenes video on its YouTube channel detailing the CGI effects that made it look like Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) was flying through the air as Falcon [minor spoilers ahead if you haven’t watched the show yet].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1CJpp"&gt;Eric Leven, VFX Supervisor for &lt;em&gt;Falcon&lt;/em&gt;, breaks down a couple of the show’s key scenes. including the mid-air chase scene from the series’ first episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrZesI"&gt;“What I really wanted to do for the big action sequences was, as much as possible, make things feel like they’re grounded in reality,” Leven explains. “Obviously, we don't have Anthony Mackie flying around in a real jet pack with real wings, but we wanted to make it feel like if he was, how would we film that?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzSFs6k5Py-D80SFvncocARXyLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22500780/falcon_vfx.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ2ImdWPM-c&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xiquhZ"&gt;He says director Kari Skogland wanted the flying scenes to convey the authentic feeling of a real person flying through the air, with wingsuit pilots who jump out of planes serving as inspiration. But they were trying to avoid emulating the flight patterns of other heroes in the MCU who can fly, like Iron Man, Leven added. The result was a new visual language for the show, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNs5LI"&gt;You can watch the full video of VFX secrets from &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jJK4PI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQ2ImdWPM-c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jzlij7"&gt;Oh and in case you’re still jonesing for more MCU&lt;em&gt;, Loki&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;premieres on Disney Plus June 9th&lt;/a&gt; (and will drop new episodes on Wednesdays instead of Fridays). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Technoking Elon Musk on SNL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBrm68NDfb6NZ6CddJg_jrKsqZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69257106/acastro_180625_2689_Elon_Fans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cHITW8"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401253/elon-musk-hosting-saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-tesla-spacex"&gt;hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. He’s coming in fresh from Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;successful Starship prototype landing&lt;/a&gt; but also on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410075/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-customer-reactions"&gt;recent customer complaints&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla’s Solar Roof costs and last month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;deadly Tesla crash&lt;/a&gt;. If you have the desire to spend part of your Saturday finding out if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;self-proclaimed Technoking&lt;/a&gt; makes a good comedy show host, here are the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qh83aU"&gt;How do I watch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PnUvCH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; airs on NBC, and it’s available to watch on the &lt;a href="https://www.nbc.com/live?brand=nbc-news"&gt;NBC website&lt;/a&gt; if you have a cable login. It will also be available on other live TV streaming services like Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g9azB"&gt;If you don’t catch it live, &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; episodes are available on Hulu and Peacock the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LmmtiR"&gt;When does it start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S38BAQ"&gt;It starts at 11:30PM ET on May 8th, which is — you guessed it — Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L9sBrE"&gt;What will happen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tBSnoW"&gt;Miley Cyrus will be performing. Beyond that, who knows! Perhaps Musk will make a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;references to Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, do a skit where he re-creates the faces he pulled &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/tech/elon-musk-joe-rogan"&gt;while smoking weed&lt;/a&gt;, or joke about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;rockets catching fire&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe his Twitter charisma won’t quite carry over, or maybe he’ll shock us with a surprisingly good delivery of a witty monologue. It remains to be seen, but either way, I’m sure we’ll hear all about it on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coda is a post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure that crosses Fury Road with Lord of the Rings </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WlAbhH3P58ub27l6NG3ZFgeel_Q=/0x412:1032x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256968/Coda_001_A_Main.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Boom Comics / Matias Bergara&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sfwpmj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbDpxs"&gt;With most mainstream comics today tending to skew more toward sci-fi superheroes, Boom Studio’s &lt;a href="https://www.boom-studios.com/wordpress/series/coda/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect gateway for those who prefer swords and sorcery — set in a magical post-apocalypse with some of the best comic art around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oavmg5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is a 12-issue fantasy comic set in a desolate apocalypse after a gigantic, magical war between the forces of good and evil that cost the world most of its magic. Think &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; if it happened after the final battle in &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, with magical power instead of water as the scarce resource that everyone is fighting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9f2pFy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is as much a story about a husband and wife figuring out their complicated marriage as it is a soaring fantasy epic. The story focuses on a bard, Hum, who’s traveling with his mutant pentacorn (a unicorn with five horns), the Nag, as he tries to save his wife from the threat of the remaining Urken (&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;’s version of orcs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1plE0KfcOPYmGa8Mqxi3AAXK1IE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499404/Coda_Header.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boom Comics / Matias Bergara&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RkolAb"&gt;Despite the initial premise, as in real life, things aren’t as clear-cut as Hum would like them to be: his wife, Serka, is no damsel in distress, and Hum’s perspective on their relationship doesn’t tell close to the whole story. Hum’s journey quickly spirals out of control. Despite his reluctance to get involved in anything (he frequently reminds others that he’s retired), his quest gets interlinked with the fate of whatever’s left of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzSR20"&gt;Adding to everything is the absolutely &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; artwork. &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is fond of gigantic, jam-packed spreads crammed full of detail, rendering Hum and Serka’s world with soft colors, harsh lines, and neon-soaked highlights. Story aside, it’s worth a look just for the art alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZbz3D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; is written by Simon Spurrier, who’s also worked on &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Doctor Aphra&lt;/em&gt; and a variety of Marvel comics (&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22396277/marvel-comics-x-men-nightcrawler-way-of-x-review"&gt;most recently &lt;em&gt;Way of X,&lt;/em&gt; a fantastic look at the Krakoan X-Men’s age of immortality&lt;/a&gt; that just came out). Artwork is by Matias Bergara, a frequent Spurrier collaborator, with colors by Michael Doig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN0sBC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; All 12 issues of &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt; are available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2FCoda-Vol-1%2Fdigital-comic%2F734806&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22425401%2Fcoda-comic-book-fantasy-adventure-post-apocalyptic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on digital comics platform Comixology&lt;/a&gt;. The series has also been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coda-Vol-1-Simon-Spurrier/dp/1684153212?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;collected into three paperback volumes&lt;/a&gt; for those who prefer their comics in physical form. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eFBquUyJ6Z97BMwopBrQAWtVmJg=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256821/VRG_ILLO_4574_SNL_ElonMusk_site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by&amp;nbsp;Grayson&amp;nbsp;Blackmon&amp;nbsp;/ The Verge | Photo by Getty Images Pool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuPbO1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Elon Musk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C963Nf"&gt;Oh, come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kn1Ly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qcb5Dz"&gt;Fine. He’s the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, the founder of The Boring Company and Neuralink, a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-paypal-mafia-the-richest-group-of-men-in-silicon-valley-2014-9"&gt;certified member of the PayPal Mafia,&lt;/a&gt; and a well-known internet troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgECzb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sounds rich.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3GNI"&gt;He is. Depending on where the market closes on Friday, he’s either &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-is-now-the-richest-person-in-the-world-passing-jeff-bezos-.html"&gt;the first or the second richest person in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The other contender is Jeff Bezos. A substantial part of both men’s net worth is tied up in their company stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eOyS6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZGCaj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;is an American television show that has been on the air since 1975. It is in a sketch comedy format. There is usually at least one good sketch in each 90-minute episode, and it is often the digital short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y320XU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; features a guest host, usually an actor with a movie to promote, and a musical guest, usually promoting a recently released album. After the “cold open,” a topical sketch about current events, the host gives a monologue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjoW54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Elon Musk doing on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, though?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guBkFR"&gt;Selling Teslas and getting richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taLcxK"&gt;Musk’s sales acumen is a running theme in Ashlee Vance’s biography of him and in the lore Musk loves to promote about himself: &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/elon-musk-family-maye-musk"&gt;arbitraging Easter eggs with his cousins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/elon-musk-ran-a-nightclub-out-of-his-college-house-to-pay-for-rent.html"&gt;running a nightclub out of his frat house,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2020/01/19/how-to-raise-a-billionaire-maye-musk-on-where-elon-gets-his-drive/"&gt;writing a computer program at age 12 and sending it to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for $500&lt;/a&gt;. A major component of sales, of course, is advertising, and the most powerful form of advertising is “earned media,” or mentions you don’t have to pay for. You know, like the kind you get by guest-hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxjA7I"&gt;Tesla famously doesn’t do paid advertisements. It doesn’t need to. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232335/elon-musk-pewdiepie-meme-review-youtube-tesla-justin-roiland"&gt;Appearing on PewDiePie’s Meme Review&lt;/a&gt; is free. So is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002684/elon-musk-driving-cybertruck-footage-photos-nobu"&gt;getting papped in a Cybertruck at Nobu&lt;/a&gt;. So is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiiAeCdhz8X/?hl=en"&gt;squiring musician Grimes&lt;/a&gt; to the Met Gala. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055248/tesla-model-3-elon-musk-when-where-handover-30-livestream"&gt;Parties for people who own Teslas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17445838/boring-company-flamethrower-elon-musk-tweets-party"&gt;Boring Company Flamethrowers&lt;/a&gt;, or who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18148061/boring-tunnel-test-drive-hawthorne-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;are just big fans&lt;/a&gt; have been part of his promotional efforts for years. He has a spicy Twitter account — spicy enough to earn &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jack-dorsey-says-elon-musk-is-his-favorite-twitter-user-misses-the-irony-2019-02-12"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s endorsement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17937768/elon-musk-sec-settlement-twitter-tesla-shareholder-lawsuit"&gt;piss off the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; — and his tweets often make headlines. This is to say nothing of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17830810/elon-musk-smokes-weed-electric-plane-design-joe-rogan-podcast"&gt;infamous Joe Rogan blunt-smoking episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlDzS4"&gt;This isn’t Musk’s first foray into Hollywood, either. He was an executive producer of &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Smoking. &lt;/em&gt;He’s also appeared in &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty, Big Bang Theory, South Park, The Simpsons, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlhbGs"&gt;Most CEOs don’t do this. Tesla gets compared to Apple a lot, and I would like you, for lols, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17856928/elon-musk-tesla-vs-apple-executive-departures-dave-morton"&gt;just visualize Tim Cook appearing on Joe Rogan’s show&lt;/a&gt; at all. Okay. Can you even see him drinking whiskey? He’s certainly not gonna &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmelzh0VJc"&gt;pass that dutch&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Jobs appeared in only one movie, a 1988 documentary about Bruce Springsteen&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIFuub"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; promises to be an hour and a half of Elon-friendly writing, with goofs that burnish his reputation and let him laugh at himself. Plus, he gets to remind everyone Tesla exists and basically re-created the electric car market at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;his competitors&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394483/cadillac-lyriq-electric-suv-price-specs-2022"&gt;jumped &lt;/a&gt;into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142642/bill-gates-elon-musk-electric-vehicles-taycan-tesla-tweets"&gt;EVs&lt;/a&gt;. My only real unanswered question about this is:&lt;em&gt; Why isn’t the musical guest Grimes, tho&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2SQaV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think he’ll &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pump Dogecoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJxtVd"&gt;I mean, yes, probably? One hedge fund made very good returns on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the GameStonk debacle&lt;/a&gt; by selling immediately &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;after Elon Musk pumped&lt;/a&gt; GameStop, so that’s something to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD025y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tesla involved in Dogecoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hvdi4f"&gt;Not as far as I know, and I love reading their financial documents. Tesla &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; involved, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;in bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;buy a Tesla with bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68ltT4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why has Elon gotten involved in Dogecoin and GameStonk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPAsdk"&gt;They’re popular online, and he, famously, loves memes — even if he often arrives at them late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKcXKu"&gt;It also seems like he really wants to be liked. Musk has spent a lot of time courting an online fan base — some of his media appearances, like on &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; and Meme Review, seem designed to appeal to that fan base. While those fans may or may not convert into actual Tesla purchases, they help keep Musk relevant and are useful in hassling his critics online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZum23"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, but what matters more to Musk, money or popularity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7eWya"&gt;Ahahahaha you are asking me to read Elon Musk’s mind? Fine, great, hold on, let me concentrate. I see… &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MziwbQv9zQ0"&gt;an army of angry squirrels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1PGCT"&gt;No, seriously, though — Musk has been consistent about his admiration for humorists. He considered buying &lt;em&gt;The Onion’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company in 2014 but ultimately didn’t put in a bid. Later, he funded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/18701197/elon-musk-thud-satire-startup-onion-launch-failure"&gt;a humor effort called &lt;em&gt;Thud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which he briefly suggested would be part of his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/3/14/17121420/elon-musk-thud-boring-company-the-onion-parody-humor-thud"&gt;“intergalactic media empire.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thud &lt;/em&gt;crashed and burned shortly after it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCzlmi"&gt;Judging by his past beef with the SEC and his history with &lt;em&gt;Thud&lt;/em&gt;, which was never meant to make money, I would argue the thing that matters most to Musk is neither money nor popularity. It’s his ability to do whatever he damn pleases. Arguably, that’s part of what makes him popular — popular enough to host &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, even. Now the question is, will he send the ratings &lt;em&gt;to the Moon&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla to pay $750k fine and build solar microgrid system to settle California air quality violations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o0KZL4RCnTb9mX3L1GSL81FBVVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256806/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BgCaSn"&gt;Tesla has agreed to pay a $750,000 fine and install a solar roof project to settle air quality violations at its Fremont, California plant, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22500632/settle_tesla_210507_2021_007_pdf.pdf"&gt;officials announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaRHHy"&gt;The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which regulates air pollution in nine San Francisco Bay Area counties, said the settlement covers 33 notices of violations dating back to 2015, including “installing or modifying equipment without proper permits, failure to conduct required emissions testing, failure to maintain records and failure to report information to the Air District in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnNUFa"&gt;The violations have since been corrected and Tesla is back in compliance, according to the air district’s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNxWXS"&gt;Both sides had agreed that the fine should be $1 million, but a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/07/tesla-will-pay-750000-fine-build-microgrid-system-to-settle-air-quality-violations/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that Tesla will pay $750,000 directly to the air district’s general operating fund. Tesla will then receive a $250,000 credit once it completes the installation of a community microgrid system, which will include rooftop solar panels, as part of the air district’s  Community Health Protection Program. That program “focuses on improving air quality and public health in the Bay Area’s most heavily impacted areas,” the statement reads. “The goal of this project is to reduce electricity costs as well as localized air pollution emissions within the community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRzcYv"&gt;Where the microgrid will be installed has yet to be determined. The settlement with the air quality district also “commits Tesla to implementing a comprehensive environmental management system,” to ensure the company remains in full compliance of environmental requirements moving forward. The air quality agency’s statement did not provide information about a deadline for when Tesla has to complete the microgrid project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GUwG9"&gt;Tesla has battled with public officials in Fremont over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;defying local pandemic shutdown&lt;/a&gt; requirements. CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;threatened to move&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s headquarters out of California, but earlier this year the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-02-19/it-looks-like-elon-musk-isnt-moving-tesla-out-of-california-after-all"&gt;company filed permits&lt;/a&gt; to expand its Fremont plant, suggesting the move was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UTAmd"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;Tesla reported a record profit&lt;/a&gt; of $438 million for the first quarter of 2021, with sales of $10.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celebrate the weekend with these money-saving tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfI5Fkysxoncw-JcWg607VgHkkQ=/253x0:1903x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256764/satechi_quattro_power_bank.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dLS97N"&gt;I’m here with the latest collection of the best tech deals that appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week. Similar to the last weekend’s post, deals have been ramping up lately. Hopefully it has helped you save a little money either shopping for yourself or a mom in your life for Mother’s Day. If you happen to be searching for a belated gift to ship over (orders placed today probably won’t arrive by Sunday, May 9th, which is Mother’s Day), check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;gift guide that’s full of fun gift ideas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olwrjz"&gt;Here are this week’s best deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xdximO"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WHXr7"&gt;Save 15 percent on useful tech accessories from Satechi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="buEbRJ"&gt;Satechi makes several accessories, like USB-C hubs, adapters, Apple Watch chargers, and much more. If you find something you want from its catalog of gadgets, it’s offering &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F8%2F22424501%2Fsatechi-accessories-ps-plus-memberships-roku-streambar-ipad-pro-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a sitewide 15 percent discount&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;FORMOM &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This deal will end on May 9th, which is Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ahNgxj"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tVRasn"&gt;Get two years of PS Plus for your PlayStation for just $54&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vr6AE"&gt;One of the best deals this week wasn’t a gadget but a membership. If you have a PS4 or PS5 and want to load up on PS Plus, you can two years’ worth of service for just $54. Sony usually charges $60 per year, so you’re saving a lot here. To get this deal, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals04062021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;go to this page and tap “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt; near the top. Then at checkout, make sure to double your quantity to two instead of one, then enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAYPROMO &lt;/strong&gt;to knock the price from around $60 down to $54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSa01L"&gt;You’ll get two codes, and you can redeem each one into your console as needed when it comes time to replenish your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEY30H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OvsA3t"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sYBdYI"&gt;Roku’s all-in-one Streambar soundbar is $30 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AjwQcL"&gt;The Streambar from Roku is a soundbar that also serves as a content streaming device that connects to your TV via HDMI. It’s only 14 inches long, so it seems like a good fit for small rooms and people who prefer a simpler setup with fewer individual pieces of hardware to plugin. Once this is set up, you’ll get audio and have a device that can access all of the major video streaming apps, like Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5YcjwU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10488551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="iTpdbz"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6r9WBX"&gt;Save $50 when you preorder Apple’s new iPad Pro with the M1 processor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Mvg9ip"&gt;Walmart is accepting preorders for the latest 11-inch iPad Pro that has the fast and efficient M1 processor, and it’s asking $50 less than many other retailers. Instead of putting down $800, it’s offering the tablet for $750. It’s not a drastic price cut, but it’s notable since this product isn’t even out yet. Walmart says purchases will ship on May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8rdEMt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QMthkj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>We may never know the exact toll of the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjWHv48PYbQgMAkeUc04r9OE-l8=/3x0:3896x2595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256654/1232727150.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A3RZmg"&gt;This pandemic has taken millions of lives around the world — and researchers are realizing that the true death toll may be much higher than the official numbers we see every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5X84z"&gt;As of May 3rd, the death toll in the US officially stood at 574,043, but a &lt;a href="http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/covid-19-has-caused-69-million-deaths-globally-more-double-what-official-reports-show"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; published this week by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that the actual toll is 905,289. IHME is a health research center based at the University of Washington that specializes in measuring global health on a population level. Its new analysis estimates that the global death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 6.93 million, not 3.24 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m0kDR0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHRbCn"&gt;The key word here is “estimate.” The researchers looked at countries around the world that reported deaths on a weekly or monthly basis. They compared that with COVID-19 testing data and many other variables to build a computer model that could estimate the death toll from COVID-19, taking into account that people died of other causes. Using that method, they found that almost every country was undercounting their deaths due to the pandemic and that their actual death tolls were much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHQMsK"&gt;That lines up with other analyses from around the world that have found that some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/world/europe/covid-russia-death.html"&gt;drastically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/non-stop-cremations-cast-doubt-indias-counting-covid-dead-2021-04-19/"&gt;undercounting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-19-death-toll-is-even-worse-than-it-looks-11610636840"&gt;their COVID dead&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also important to note that not everyone agrees with the shockingly high numbers found in the new analysis. Other studies into excess deaths have found much lower totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XFpVd"&gt;“Their estimate of excess deaths is enormous and inconsistent with our research and others,” Steven Woolf &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/06/994287048/new-study-estimates-more-than-900-000-people-have-died-of-covid-19-in-u-s"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s Becky Sullivan&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Woolf led a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778361?resultClick=1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found that excess deaths in the US were around 20 percent higher than they should have been. “There are a lot of assumptions and educated guesses built into their model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaOvvS"&gt;The problem isn’t unique to deaths. Back in April 2020, Nicole Wetsman wrote about how it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241402/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data"&gt;impossible for us to track every case of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. That’s still true. Public health officials can only track the people who notice symptoms or seek out treatment or testing. And that’s in places where treatments or testing is available, which isn’t the case everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYc4HE"&gt;It’s always hard to count every case and even every death in any large outbreak, much less a pandemic. People aren’t perfect record-keepers, even when it comes to life and death. Often, our records come down to what the person writing thought was important — and whether they happened to record that information in a way that future generations could understand. Historians are still arguing over the death toll for the Black Plague, which killed &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21539483/covid-19-black-death-plagues-in-history"&gt;anywhere from 25 million to 200 million people&lt;/a&gt;, depending on who you ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmRIxU"&gt;Things got a little better last century when we were wrestling with the 1918 flu. The US did keep tabs on deaths throughout the states — well, most of them. Mortality statistics in 1918 were only gathered for 31 “registration” states that represented about 75 percent of the population at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210329.51293/full/"&gt;according to a fascinating blog&lt;/a&gt; in Health Affairs. To get the estimated death toll, they took the death tolls in the registration states and just added 25 percent to the total. But the population in those registration states wasn’t exactly the same as the population of the rest of the country. People in registration states were more likely to be white and live in urban areas than people living in non-registration states. 1918’s estimate was certainly better than the information that we have for the Black Plague, but it’s not a full picture of that death toll either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0O9rml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tracking a slow-rolling disaster like a pandemic is brutally hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRfnR1"&gt;Today, we gather a lot more data, but we’re still not perfect. That’s why it’s taking models to estimate the still-growing toll of the pandemic. Not everyone who dies gets tested for COVID, and in some parts of the world, testing and treatments remain inconsistent. Even the dead we know about slip through the cracks. In New York, refrigerated trucks are &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/missing-them/2021/5/6/22423844/new-york-covid-victims-still-in-trucks-on-brooklyn-pier"&gt;still being used to hold people&lt;/a&gt; who have died of COVID as they await burial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1XIeb"&gt;Tracking a slow-rolling disaster like a pandemic is brutally hard. It means looking at the names and birthdates and death dates and adding all those lives together into a faceless number too big for our brains to wrestle with. It can feel easier to push it away and wrestle with the things we can control instead and just let the numbers pile up uncounted, shoved in a cold truck on a pier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0JdrC"&gt;But ignoring the costs and accepting our statistical shortcomings won’t help us in the long run. A more accurate accounting of our dead might help people understand more about how this disease can overtake our defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2ZdFT"&gt;“We need to better understand the impact of COVID across the globe so that countries can understand the trajectory of the pandemic and figure out where to deploy additional resources, like testing supplies and vaccines to stop the spread,” epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/06/994287048/new-study-estimates-more-than-900-000-people-have-died-of-covid-19-in-u-s"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbBnU6"&gt;Maybe — just maybe — we can learn from our mistakes — or at the very least, maybe we can stop making the same ones over and over. &lt;/p&gt;

But experts are also bracing for a new set of problems that may hit when the pandemic ends. (Andrew Joseph / &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberattack prompts shutdown of major fuel pipeline in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline victim of cyberattack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GCiphbs72gAypOxY1fi7GvdHbY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256608/608064478.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Colonial Pipeline says it was victim of cyberattack | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquAdU"&gt;One of the largest pipelines in the US has been taken offline by its operator following a cyberattack. First &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Colonial Pipeline, which carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern US, &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; late Friday that it took “certain systems offline to contain the threat, which has temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3mR5y"&gt;The pipeline is 5,500 miles long and carries jet fuel and refined gasoline from the Gulf Coast to New York, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, transporting some 2.5 million barrels daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I1mb4"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether the attack targeted Colonial’s industrial control systems, or if the attack was carried out by foreign government hackers. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, citing a US official familiar with the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/08/cyber-attack-colonial-pipeline/"&gt;reported that the incident was a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N926dw"&gt;Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial said it had engaged a “leading third-party cybersecurity firm” to investigate the nature and scope of the incident, and has contacted law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PiagIw"&gt;Colonial Pipeline is taking steps to understand and resolve this issue. At this time, our primary focus is the safe and efficient restoration of our service and our efforts to return to normal operation. This process is already underway, and we are working diligently to address this matter and to minimize disruption to our customers and those who rely on Colonial Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zrUZh"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that it was unlikely that the shutdown would cause immediate disruption to consumers, since most of the fuel goes into storage tanks, and the US has seen a reduction in energy use due to the pandemic. How long the pipeline may remain shut down was still unclear Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6E9b5u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 8th 10:14AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds detail that the incident reportedly was a ransomware attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why even the studios behind bestselling games shut down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Press Reset by Jason Schreier cover" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/By0jtHNIJIlneSQjAY929i3yY2Y=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69256439/pressresetcover.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ruin and recovery in the video game industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bpwn9O"&gt;In March 2013, Irrational Games released &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the third game in the bestselling &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; shooter series. It should have been a triumphant moment — early reviews were strong, the game shipped millions of copies, and the developers started work on an expansion called &lt;em&gt;Burial At Sea&lt;/em&gt;. But less than a year later, studio head Ken Levine called employees into the kitchen for an all-hands meeting. He told them that Irrational — the team behind one of the last decade’s most acclaimed and successful series, just weeks from releasing its final chapter — was shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="fR7Pd1"&gt;Irrational is one of several studios featured in &lt;a href="https://www.grandcentralpublishing.com/titles/jason-schreier/press-reset/9781538735480/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Press Reset&lt;/em&gt; is the second book from Jason Schreier, a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; journalist known for his detailed inside looks at studios like &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt; developer Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a loosely connected postmortem of teams that worked on everything from ambitious roleplaying games to widely loathed freemium titles — often bleak but also intriguing, hopeful, and sometimes darkly funny. In an interview before the book’s release, I spoke with Schreier about how a volatile industry can move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="bioshock infinite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DADfjssQbHhVbZ9JEX67fQxWQfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2404983/bioshock-infinite.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SpNsC7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfHI7R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you see as the biggest common thread between why the studios in your book closed and the biggest differences between them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkcYXT"&gt;The biggest thread is always money in some way or another. It’s always like: “We ran out of money,” or “We don’t think that this is going to lead to enough money,” or “This is not going to lead to enough growth,” or “We need this money for something else.” It all comes back to just the flaws of unregulated late-stage capitalism and the issues that causes and the insatiable need for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6br2qg"&gt;A lot of times, that’s oversimplifying it, though. One of the things that I found over the course of reporting for this book was that layoffs and studio shutdowns can happen for all sorts of reasons. Some of them are logical. Some of them are not so logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGeP2O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of the practices don’t just seem exploitative; they seem really counterproductive. Like studios that will staff up a whole expert first-person shooter team, and then abruptly change direction for the game and hire a new team, and then switch back again and have lost all of the people that they managed to collect before. Are there rational reasons for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ap5WJ"&gt;I was thinking about this a lot last night because last night was the NFL draft, and I’m a big fan. But one of the things that is so infuriating about the NFL and a lot of sports organizations is that the people making the decisions, the general managers and the head coaches, are on very short leashes. They know that if they underperform for two or three years in a row, they will get fired. It’s not in their best interests to be like, “Okay, what will this move now mean for our team five years from now, 10 years from now? Will it leave us screwed because we spent all our money on these players and they’re not actually very good, or will set us up in a position to succeed because we have all these extra draft picks?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wwc9fY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have this messed-up system where people are rewarded for thinking short-term”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsh5as"&gt;And I feel like the video game industry is very, very similar. Because you have these executives — some of whom might have the freedom to think about like, “Okay, what is the company like five years, 10 years from now?” But a lot of them have to think about their next fiscal quarter, especially these publicly traded companies where there’s not a lot of patience from shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNCYxy"&gt;If you’re not delivering on growth — and exponential growth — every single quarter, every single year, then you are seen as a failure to shareholders. It’s difficult, if not impossible, for the people making the decision to think in terms of, what is the studio’s roadmap going to look like 10 years from now? We have this messed-up system where people are rewarded for thinking short-term, even if it damages everybody in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCou4H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About half the book traces the genealogy of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Shock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and the people who worked on things related to it like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Did that just happen as you followed leads, or do you think there’s something distinctly noteworthy about that lineage? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYTyvq"&gt;First of all, I think that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim"&gt;immersive sims&lt;/a&gt;, because they’re critically acclaimed but tend to not sell exceptionally well, they tend to be tied to some of these big studio shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPApOu"&gt;But also, my first book was structured in a way where you could pick up any chapter in the book and read it and get a lot out of it without having to read the rest. For &lt;em&gt;Press Reset&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted it to feel more like one ongoing narrative. And one of the things I wanted to do there was look at a company like [&lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; developer] Irrational and then trace back the lineage there with [&lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; producer] Warren Spector and then also look at some of the people who came out of that, and then look over to the side to [&lt;em&gt;BioShock 2&lt;/em&gt; developer] 2K Marin. I wanted this to feel like more of an overarching story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9lf8o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getdizzzy/status/636198494093606912"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a tweet I like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about how everyone who worked on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;went on to make their own &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioShock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfisJB"&gt;I was pretty surprised at how much success in the indie sphere came out of the ashes of Irrational and 2K Marin. So many cool indie games can just be traced back to that same lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXZdHX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The gaming community as a whole can be really draining”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8Axky"&gt;And really, it all, I think, traces back to Warren Spector, who I think is a really fascinating person. I think he would want to give credit to other people as well, which is totally fair — like Doug Church and Paul Neurath and some of the other folks from that era. But a lot of people were inspired by his philosophy, which is very much the game-making philosophy of putting the tools in the player’s hands rather than the designer’s, which I think is has been incredibly influential on all sorts of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qh7okB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the chapter about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_(2014_video_game)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, you allude to fans telling the developers to kill themselves in this incredibly matter-of-fact aside — like, “Yeah, that’s how the games industry works.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkptb8"&gt;I hope people pick up on that being as wry as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="furh4z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role do you think gaming fandom plays in the trajectory of the games industry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R2qbQ"&gt;I think mostly negative. But I think that also one of the interesting things about that chapter is that, toward the end, the folks who went on to make &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt; after &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Keeper&lt;/em&gt; found that they had their own Reddit community, and they were kind of wincing, bracing themselves for it, only to find that it was only positive responses and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM8Jpx"&gt;But yeah, I think that the gaming community as a whole can be really draining for a lot of people. I think if you actually talk to a lot of game developers behind the scenes, a lot of them are very scared and exhausted by their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfB2So"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, one of the themes of the book is that ongoing games that involve creating some kind of relationship with an audience are one path forward for developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ckYmA"&gt;There are a lot of people doing really cool things in that space. Like you think of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and other big moneymakers. But in the book, I talk about &lt;em&gt;The Blackout Club&lt;/em&gt;, which I think is a really cool example of how game developers are doing creative stuff in that space — it’s essentially online interactive theater, which is wild to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rotqOC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are ways to cultivate an audience of chill people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2Hs81"&gt;I think when you do something like that, and you know it’s not going to be super big, there are ways to cultivate an audience of chill people and not have to deal with the shitheads that often show up when you’re dealing with bigger-scale things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1VDic"&gt;This is a thought that’s just occurring to me now, so it’s a little bit half-baked. But I think that one of the problems with internet communities is because they have no max limit, once they hit a certain size, they’re always going to bring in just shitty people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZqVCf"&gt;If you were an online game developer and you were to be able to say, like, “I just want 20,000 people to buy my game and that’s it. I don’t want more than that. I don’t want to be a millionaire. I just want to have a bunch of good people who get what we’re trying to do,” then that might lead to something cool. But then you get into what I was talking about earlier, with this need for constant growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kf3Zuf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the pandemic has shifted the industry in a meaningful way — especially with remote work since one of the problems for a lot of the people in the book is that they have to move to a specific city for a studio and then they’re locked in there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv0Oz9"&gt;Yes — yes, yes, yes. I finished up most of my book probably a week before it started. And to see now, after a year and a half, that people actually have been able to be productive from home remotely — to make that potentially an option moving forward would really just change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpnkMH"&gt;Because what I’ve been told is that that’s the worst part. Is not only not getting to see your friends again or having to look for a new job, but knowing that you might have to move 3,000 miles for your next job. That uproots your life. You might have to pull your kids out of school. You might just say, “Hey, I’m not going to do this. So I guess I’ll just have to leave the video game industry entirely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7StmeV"&gt;A lot of the burnout that I explored and talked about in the book is the result of that. And I think if game companies said, “You know what, actually we’re going to be a lot more accepting of remote work. We’re going to hire people from anywhere. It doesn’t matter where,” I think it would really just change everything and create a more healthy, sustainable environment for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nY9Zzp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grandcentralpublishing.com/titles/jason-schreier/press-reset/9781538735480/"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be released on May 11th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Blade 11 Prime review: wireless charging for under $200</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re already invested in a wireless charging lifestyle, the Blade 11 Prime is a budget phone to match it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FhlERh"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime offers one standout feature in a field of largely similar sub-$200 phones: wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrkxr"&gt;In the smartphone trickle-down economy, wireless charging is basically guaranteed on any flagship-level phone, but it’s still hit-and-miss among midrange phones and all but absent from the budget class. You’re much more likely to find a really big battery on a sub-$200 phone than wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvbdFz"&gt;Outside of that feature, the $192 Blade 11 Prime’s specs are much the same as competing models like the Galaxy A12 and Moto G Play. Like those models, it offers a 6.5-inch 720p LCD, though it includes a little more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB) and a little less battery capacity (4,000mAh compared to 5,000mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iWF3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNoWZ2"&gt;Choosing a phone that’s priced under $500 means you need to pick your priorities carefully, and that’s even more true of a $200 phone. If wireless charging is your chosen priority, then I have good news: the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the budget-priced phone for you. If it’s not a major priority and more of a nice-to-have item, then I’d suggest looking elsewhere. You won’t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better on any individual feature, like a better screen or camera, but you can do a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7aGzfYqtO3jDkBBbJVlrwVscPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499384/DSC00618.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 11 Prime supports the Qi wireless charging standard at 5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZXqSGm"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0RE5qQ"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime is on the bigger side with a 6.5-inch display. Its 720p resolution is stretched a little thin here, and you’ll notice certain images looking a little pixelated if you look closely. The screen gets nice and bright, but its auto-brightness setting kept bringing the level down a little too dim for my liking. I also noticed faint repeating vertical lines on dark parts of the screen indicative of a low-quality panel — not a huge distraction but visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCGzys"&gt;It doesn’t have the biggest battery in its class, but the Blade 11’s battery performance is generally good anyway. I got about two days of light, mostly Wi-Fi use on a single charge. Spending a full day out and about on LTE would drain the battery faster, but most people could expect to get through at least a full day of heavy use before needing to charge up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lA0FtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84Tx3H"&gt;The Blade 11 Prime’s marquee feature, wireless charging, works well if a little slowly; the phone supports Qi charging at 5W. Taking it from 50 percent to a full charge took almost exactly two hours, during which the phone got warm but not worryingly so. As long as you don’t expect incredible speeds, wireless charging is a convenient option on the Blade 11 Prime, particularly if you’re the type of person who charges your phone overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFG6iS"&gt;We don’t expect dazzling processing speed from a $200 phone, but the ZTE Blade 11 Prime falls a little short even considering its price. It uses a MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22 chipset with a relatively healthy 4GB of RAM, but this combination struggles with even light tasks like scrolling through Instagram or Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvFtlB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSJlfT"&gt;Apps open quickly enough, but there was significant stuttering and hesitation just browsing my usual social media timelines or scrolling through the home screen app drawer. Some slowness is expected in this price bracket, but I didn’t see as much consistent stuttering using the Motorola Moto G Play recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYQzw"&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime ships with Android 11, which is nice — some of its slightly less recent competitors are still on 10 waiting for an update. ZTE says there’s no plan to offer any additional Android OS upgrades, only that it will offer security patches as needed. That’s not too surprising given the phone’s price point; the Blade 11 Prime just isn’t built for longevity past a couple of years of use. There’s also 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t a lot. If you don’t download too many apps or store too many photos on your device, you’ll be able to get by, otherwise adding a microSD card for additional storage to your purchase is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCrwittUPuG9PycMvyuvK3xxNJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499278/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera hardware is modest: on the rear panel, you’ll find a 16-megapixel main and 8-megapixel ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNR8HQ"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3ytKxp"&gt;The rear camera system on the Blade 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It’s a basic setup, and it does fine in good lighting conditions. It’s a little more prone to clipping very bright spots in photos than other systems I’ve used recently, but it does a nice job overall with exposures of high-contrast scenes. In moderate indoor lighting, some detail-smoothing noise reduction is visible, and low-light photos look smeary even at the reduced image sizes used for social sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hslgFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10488604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ7zW0"&gt;As for the other cameras, they’re just fine. The ultrawide doesn’t handle high-contrast scenes as well as the main camera, with some noticeable noise appearing in shadows. There’s also a short delay after pressing the shutter button before you can take another photo that isn’t present when using the main camera. The selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces, and photos look good as long as there’s plenty of available light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIM3M88y4fLAFcJpaUPhyJED2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499279/ajohnson_20210503_4571_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t already a wireless charging devotee, it would be best to look elsewhere in the budget phone class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GHIFo6"&gt;If your budget is strict and wireless charging is a must-have, then the ZTE Blade 11 Prime is the right phone for you. But if you can make do without wireless charging, I’d strongly encourage you to look elsewhere. Iffy performance with basic tasks will be more of an inconvenience in the long run than having to plug in your phone every night to charge it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BrrNaH"&gt;This year’s Motorola Moto G Power would be a worthwhile alternative if you can spend a little more; you’ll get a faster processor and better battery life, though you should definitely plan on buying a microSD card to supplement its meager 32GB of storage. The G Play is a good alternative, too, even with a processor that’s a bit slower than the G Power’s.&lt;/p&gt;
