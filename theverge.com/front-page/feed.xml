    <title>NFT makers are trying to build the next Disney</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SdJKCnIaYFLvIUYjciNGX4LtYOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154365/acastro_211115_4866_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a long way to go&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KlAjAk"&gt;In the online auction market OpenSea, you can pay around $600 to buy a portrait of a robot in streetwear — and, if you’re lucky, a stake in a new media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="ibOJUG"&gt;The robot is called a TARS, and it’s part of the Voguverse, an elaborate 37th-century mythos involving space arcologies, a nuclear war, and interstellar travel. The portrait is one of countless digital assets being sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. But by pairing its fictional universe with a blockchain-based ledger, the creators think they can tap into a new way to tell stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be9QD4"&gt;As NFTs explode in popularity, entrepreneurs are imagining an entire media industry that’s built around them. At its most ambitious, the vision is sometimes dubbed a “decentralized Disney”: a world of fictional crossovers like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its many spinoffs but where different characters and creative properties are owned by a panoply of fans, not a single company. Talent agencies, comics authors, and countless NFT enthusiasts are buying in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avAx3f"&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; mean? Many are still figuring that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Images of a hat, glasses, and jewelry in neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piSL7e5rZww3j9YrmuYVRjdlgf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021480/acastro_211115_4866_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aRLqDl"&gt;Over the past couple of years, NFTs — essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;certificates of ownership inscribed on a cryptocurrency blockchain&lt;/a&gt; — have exploded into a lucrative and growing market. Some of the most sought-after NFTs are collectibles: typically limited edition runs of unique, automatically generated avatars or other items. The most popular tokens can sell for millions of dollars in sales that are more like an art auction than a bitcoin trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keMuhY"&gt;NFTs have made the biggest waves in the fine art world, and some NFT collectibles series are united by an aesthetic rather than a concrete narrative. CryptoPunks, the best-known example, are a set of 10,000 mostly human pixelated portraits. But many are based in some kind of fictional setting. At its simplest, this might look like the city of “Arctopolis,” where Chill City NFT penguins live and work. At its most complex, it might involve something like the Voguverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A city street scene of penguins driving on ice roads with igloo houses on the corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nlx73TQ8Fir6GMtYrunn6VmSe2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018440/60a1befaac554e547aaaf723_ChillCityTown.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chill City&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art depicting the home of Chill City NFT penguins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KpIpyS"&gt;The Voguverse lore is laid out on a web page explaining the backstory of the TARS, a name that stands for “Tether Assisted Robotic Skeleton.” In the far future, Earth is uninhabitable, and humans live in space-bound “hives” ruled by a galactic government and mega-corporations that deal in cryptocurrency. (A lot of NFT lore involves crypto fans getting rich.) People use TARS telepresence bots to revisit their home planet, buying models that reflect their personalities and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esn61L"&gt;Vogu founder Andrew Trackzy sees TARS as a potential building block for the next big media intellectual property, or IP. “Our goals for Vogu and this IP is to grow it to a large-scale worldwide IP, just like Star Wars, just like Pokémon,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Even if Vogu doesn’t hit this bar, he thinks some other project will. “I do believe that — whether it’s us or another project that comes before or after us — that someone in the NFT space will create the next big worldwide IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37ZkiS"&gt;He’s not alone. Some NFT series involve formal media tie-ins, like Stoner Cats, a collectible that’s funding an animated series featuring Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane. Other creators have struck open-ended deals to leverage their fame: CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/"&gt;signed to Hollywood talent agency UTA&lt;/a&gt; in August, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club is represented by U2 and Madonna manager Guy Oseary. Trackzy says Vogu is currently talking with several potential media partners and working on a webtoon set in the Voguverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BxFbr"&gt;Trackzy’s plan mimics the strategy of building powerhouse media franchises from toy lines like &lt;em&gt;GI Joe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt;. NFTs have some crucial differences from action figures, however, beyond being harder for kids to play with. For one thing, many buyers are seeking a fast-growing investment rather than an art piece or a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="53INwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people probably aren’t calling up &lt;em&gt;Thundercats&lt;/em&gt; and being like, dude, Lion-O did not have the screen time in the last episode that I needed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIo2ou"&gt;“With an action figure, most people probably aren’t calling up &lt;em&gt;Thundercats&lt;/em&gt; and being like, dude, Lion-O did not have the screen time in the last episode that I needed,” says Trackzy, referencing the 1980s TV series. “As a project, you’re constantly under pressure from your community to increase the value of that collectible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIl6wq"&gt;Because each NFT avatar is unique, buyers can also forge a connection with a genuinely (if only slightly) one-of-a-kind character. Some NFT buyers make fan art of their purchases, while others spin entire independent stories around them like Jenkins the Valet, a character built around a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT. If one of these stories blows up, it can raise the profile of the entire lineup. The buyers can sell their NFT if they want to move on to another project, and unlike an action figure, the person who minted the NFT can collect a royalty every time a collectible changes hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11VkoC"&gt;To NFT proponents like investor Drew Austin — who’s working on his own community NFT narrative project — that mix marks the birth of a new media model. “We are putting the foundation in place so that people can use their imagination and create stories and content and experiences with their own characters that they own through this because it’s an NFT,” says Austin. “The ability to be able to leverage the community, to be able to expand on IP and to create a universe, I think, is a really exciting concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O39Jd3"&gt;The dream might sound intuitive in the world of modern media franchises, where giant games and blockbuster movies are shaped by convoluted licensing deals for beloved figures like Spider-Man. Instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/16/17461884/marvel-fans-fox-comcast-deal-x-men-mcu"&gt;rooting for a giant corporate merger&lt;/a&gt; that might let the X-Men hang out with the Avengers, fans could directly collaborate to have their favorite characters share the same fictional world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of an action figure in a package in neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCQ3JYRe9tCOERRrJd6nbVKRbmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021483/acastro_211115_4866_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bWmKnB"&gt;For believers, NFTs and entertainment IP rights seem like a perfect match — an emerging market with overwhelming possibilities and hype paired with a billion-dollar industry in dire need of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3E1Cyu"&gt;But owning a fictional character and owning an NFT mean very different things, and the two forms of ownership don’t neatly overlap. It’s an often overlooked but incredibly important distinction that much of the NFT world is still grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zVMfr"&gt;To explain why, we have to dig into how NFTs and intellectual property work. NFTs are, at an incredibly oversimplified level, entries on a database called a blockchain. These entries represent (or sometimes directly encode) a file or even a physical object, and an entry is linked with a specific cryptocurrency wallet. “Owning” an NFT means having its entry associated with a digital wallet you control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTysKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFTs don’t confer any specific, universal set of legal rights&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knQ7PY"&gt;“Owning” a media property, by contrast, typically means that you hold the copyrights and trademarks associated with it. A copyright — again, at an incredibly simplified level — is an exclusive, automatically granted legal right to sell copies of a creative work or produce other media based on it. A trademark stops other people from selling commercial goods with a name or mark that you’ve registered with an agency like the US Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRzCgF"&gt;NFTs don’t confer a specific set of legal rights. If anything, part of their appeal is supposed to be that you don’t need a government involved in enforcing their ownership. By contrast, copyright and trademark are complex legal frameworks enforced by individual countries and international bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmH5Au"&gt;Some NFT collectibles, like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/disney-golden-moments-walt-disney-mickey-mouse-9821fb07fdd7"&gt;a new lineup sold by Disney&lt;/a&gt;, basically operate at the level of trading cards and confer no rights to the underlying art. But other NFT sellers do try to outline some kind of intellectual property framework. They draw up terms of service, laying out which legal rights they’re allowing buyers to exercise. Owning the NFT (in the “having a wallet linked to its entry” sense) signals that both parties have agreed to this contract. If one side breaks it, the two parties could go to court, the same way you could sue over any broken contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pair of Vogu TARS robots in streetwear with the titles “Core” and “Kouwei” collection" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG399A_UhFKZ8vBC2AX884GcJOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018449/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_8.34.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Vogu Collective&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voguverse robot NFTs are part of a complex fictional universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7GwX"&gt;But these contracts vary widely. Holding a &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/chill-city-nft-collectibles"&gt;Chill City penguin&lt;/a&gt; NFT allows you to print non-commercial “one-off units” of T-shirts or other items depicting the penguin. A Bored Ape Yacht Club agreement lets you sell merchandise or derivative works depicting your ape, although you can only use the phrase “Bored Ape” to reference the NFT number. CryptoKitties uses the &lt;a href="https://www.nftlicense.org/"&gt;NFT License&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt at a standardized NFT intellectual property framework. Cool Cats offers a single sentence saying users are “free to do anything” with their digital cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMw8c5"&gt;Even a fairly generous NFT deal isn’t the equivalent of Disney owning the Avengers, as you’ll see if you look at lore-heavy collectibles like Vogu’s TARS. Vogu’s terms of service give TARS owners an exclusive copyright license to an image of a robot with the NFT’s specific combination of features. If Vogu wants to depict that exact robot in its media, the contractual deal it struck with the current owner says it needs to either get their permission or buy it back from them. The company apparently spent $16,000 reacquiring one besuited robot to use it as a fictitious in-universe CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11CTJH"&gt;But buying the NFT doesn’t give you any intellectual property rights to the underlying details of the Voguverse, like the backstory of the robots or the term “TARS.” If you wanted to make a cartoon starring your TARS without Vogu’s active approval, you’d have to invent a whole new sci-fi world complete with new names for everything — as Trackzy puts it, &lt;em&gt;Robot Dude In A Kimono&lt;/em&gt; is acceptable,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but &lt;em&gt;Vogu Kimono Guy&lt;/em&gt; is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FX28jC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you look at a CryptoPunk, it sort of served as inspiration to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YKeryI"&gt;NFT creators can also bypass buyers by designing a non-minted media character in the style of their collectibles. If Vogu had really wanted to avoid paying for a CEO that looked like a specific TARS, it could have made a nearly identical robot but added an extra accessory. For future projects, the Vogu Collective plans to hold virtual casting calls for cameo roles, but its major characters won’t be drawn from the TARS NFT lineup. Other creators take similar tacks: &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cats&lt;/em&gt; isn’t selling NFTs of its main characters, for example — it’s offering collectibles recombining their attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRMlFw"&gt;“We wanted artists in the space to be able to exercise their creativity and use what they purchase. That’s part of the value of owning these assets,” says Trackzy. “At the end of the day, it’s a business decision that we had to make, to make sure that the community was happy with the rights that we gave them. But we also have to make sure that when I go and sit down with Universal Studios, they’re comfortable that they can make a movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wlyuKj"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NX3I7x"&gt;Many NFT sellers still want people to play in their sandboxes. Unlike Disney, a company notorious for ruthless copyright crackdowns, plenty of them welcome fan works, including for-profit add-on NFT series. But that’s not unusual for small creative projects of any stripe, and a lot of collaborations involve handshake approval or one-off licensing deals, not an automatic blockchain contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFFpwt"&gt;The team behind Jenkins the Valet says they’ve been collaborating with BAYC since the beginning of the project. “Our teams are working together to make sure that everyone is protected, and we will continue to exercise due care to make sure that their IP is expressed in a positive way that does not contradict what they are building,” they wrote in an email. (That said, they won’t be using the Bored Ape branding in their work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ssp7ZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted artists in the space to be able to exercise their creativity and use what they purchase. That’s part of the value of owning these assets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpY4Du"&gt;The Vogu Collective also grants licensing permissions on a case-by-case basis, including to people who don’t own its NFT. One TARS-less fan is currently building a Voguverse-themed tabletop role-playing game based on the freely available &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; ruleset, thanks to an informal agreement that gives Vogu final approval rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The cover of Punks #1 comic" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/db2CvPeM4qhxU7qC34Ogg5OQC9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021492/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_8.20.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Pixel Vault&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The cover of Punks #1 comic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvSTqC"&gt;Some people are making NFT-based art without this kind of top-down approval, but they’re treading carefully around thorny ownership issues. &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; comic — one of multiple comics and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/the-world-s-largest-record-company-is-creating-an-nft-super-group?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;at least one band&lt;/a&gt; involving team-ups between different NFT avatars — is based on portraits from the CryptoPunks lineup. While Pixel Vault members own the avatars in question, Pixel Vault founder Sean Gearin says they haven’t been able to contact CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs for approval. Instead, the company enlisted three teams of lawyers to create a “100 percent unique” intellectual property inspired by the collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVQYub"&gt;Punk #8146 of CryptoPunks, for instance, is a tiny and nameless figure with a barely visible cigarette and a propeller beanie. &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; protagonist Beanie has the same hat and cigarette, but he’s got a backstory as a former busboy who becomes a digital art kingpin, and he’s drawn in a far more detailed comic-book style. “When you look at a CryptoPunk, it sort of served as inspiration to us, but when you look at the comic itself, it bears no resemblance really to the original art of Larva Labs,” says Gearin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJHRBM"&gt;Pixel Vault’s process resembles a fandom strategy called &lt;a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Filing_Off_The_Serial_Numbers"&gt;filing off the serial numbers&lt;/a&gt;, where authors change names and world details to make original stories out of fanfiction. This also happens in traditional comics: &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol’s&lt;/em&gt; Willoughby Kipling was created as a direct stand-in for &lt;em&gt;Hellblazer’s&lt;/em&gt; John Constantine, and Marvel’s Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/1/28/10860668/deadpool-deathstroke-deadshot"&gt;began as a near-clone&lt;/a&gt; of DC’s Slade Wilson (aka Deathstroke.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XivMn"&gt;NFTs play an important social role here. If Pixel Vault didn’t own the individual CryptoPunks it’s drawing inspiration from, &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; would probably draw community censure and pressure from Larva Labs. But the blockchain isn’t replacing long-standing legal maneuvers — or changing the fact that you don’t need a license to get inspired by a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Images of avatar faces in a neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GwJR89rvKD1YDGPDX3k-pM_ZO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021486/acastro_211115_4866_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPbAtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; is only a jumping-off point for Pixel Vault, which is trying its own ambitious approach to NFT storytelling. That’s the Metahero Universe: a nascent franchise built by a core creative team but run partly by fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD63VO"&gt;Metahero started with a series of generative NFT avatars representing heroes and villains. Pixel Vault wants it to include a series of comic books and a big-budget massively multiplayer game. To manage this, it’s founded a series of planet-themed decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmLL9V"&gt;DAOs are essentially groups of token holders who pool their resources and vote on decisions, similar to shareholders at a company. This system offers broad decentralized decision-making rather than ownership of a specific character. It could also add complications to the already difficult process of designing a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL4Ap0"&gt;Building a Metahero game could be tough under any circumstances. When I spoke to Pixel Vault, the company had a 17-person staff whose background mostly wasn’t in game design. (It’s apparently considering partnering with a larger studio.) With the DAO structure, NFT holders are supposed to pick the game’s genre — like a battle royale title or a more traditional MMO — and then vote on numerous decisions throughout development, to the point of firing an entire creative team. It’s an intriguing experiment, but it also sounds a bit like running a Kickstarter campaign for a piece of video game concept art and promising to let backers run the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lfxgxG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think self-preservation will ultimately rule the day”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7e70qO"&gt;If a game is open to non-DAO members, as Gearin says the Metahero MMO will be, the structure also seems to encourage a fandom crypto-aristocracy. Pixel Vault wants to balance the experience so players without an expensive NFT could join and have fun, even if more money offers visual flair or special abilities. But in theory, DAO holders could simply order the developer to let them steamroll every other player in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjEzm9"&gt;Gearin thinks DAO members will avoid this because they’re invested in the overall long-term health of the game. “I think self-preservation will ultimately rule the day. So even if initially, they like the idea of ‘We want to be able to pay to win,’ ultimately that’s going to stunt the growth of the game, right?” he says. “The community can ultimately decide what they will, and it will be somewhat unpredictable. But at the end of the day, people typically act in what they believe their own best interest is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCVzHC"&gt;In case they don’t, Pixel Vault has an escape hatch: it controls 45 percent of the voting power in any decision. The planetary DAOs control another 45 percent, and 10 percent is tied up in a “founders DAO” that’s not associated with Pixel Vault but composed of early adopters who support its vision. “It’s kind of like the little security to help ensure that the best decision gets made if we indeed have the best decision,” Gearin says. But at least, in theory, all the DAOs could unite against their creator — taking the universe in any direction they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JAZA0Y"&gt;
&lt;p id="38yEcS"&gt;While Metahero is an organized attempt to create a decentralized media franchise, some NFT creators are taking the opposite tack: starting with a tantalizingly skeletal collectible, then encouraging NFT owners to build a fan-made world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL8qj2"&gt;The best example of this is Loot, created by Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann. Loot bags are procedurally generated lists with a &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons-&lt;/em&gt;like fantasy flavor: Loot Bag #980’s contents include “Crown” and “Demon Husk;” #2073 includes “Shoes,” “Necklace,” and “‘Rune Root’ Quarterstaff of Giants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXBgqg"&gt;Since launching in August, the text-based Loot bags have inspired a dedicated fandom. Buyers made art depicting their bag’s contents and formed guilds with people who own the same item, while other creators designed independent NFTs that pair with the bags. If you own a Loot Bag, you can do things like generate a custom Loot Character, a pixelated avatar wearing or holding items from the bag. The Loot Character is then minted as an NFT that’s permanently linked with the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKAx1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As soon as you make it formal, it starts to feel much more like you’re engaging with a corporation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DObPPe"&gt;A Loot Character team member who goes by Moniker says the group talks regularly with the core Loot team. But the whole enterprise is deliberately informal. There’s no hard answer to who holds the rights to Loot Characters’ art or even the name of the project since it’s derivative of the original Loot NFT lineup. “It’s sort of a bit of a handshake at this point,” Moniker says. “As soon as you make it formal, it starts to feel much more like you’re engaging with a corporation than you are a bunch of folks that are just really excited about a project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A procedurally generated Loot Character" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8MVBgD_iIJcH-LqKSOo-necL8A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021495/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_8.22.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Loot Character&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A procedurally generated Loot Character&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXs2pU"&gt;Some other projects have followed Loot’s formula, like Adventure Cards, which generates the names of cards for a nonexistent &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;-style game. Adventure Cards has inspired its own community-built augmentations, including a simple but playable digital game. “I want people to feel like they can own the cards and be inspired by the cards, as long as everyone is explicit about what their contribution is,” says Adventure Cards creator Paul McKellar, previously a member of Square’s founding team. “I’d like to do whatever, honestly, lets people do as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzNVKc"&gt;But NFT creators’ commitment to openness generally hasn’t extended to a formal system for sharing ownership of the world, at least not yet. “I think that it’s really yet to be determined what the best ways of leading the communities are,” McKellar says. One possibility is a DAO composed of people who have contributed to the Adventure Cards universe. If a company wanted to adapt the series for film or TV, they’d work with the DAO to sign a deal, and DAO members could split the profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GVCKn6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s really yet to be determined what the best ways of leading the communities are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGmfaT"&gt;That’s a starkly different model from some older web art. The &lt;a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/"&gt;SCP Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, is a wiki composed of thousands of fictitious paranormal incident reports written by a plethora of authors. The entries are licensed under Creative Commons, an alternative copyright model that lets anybody remix or build on a work. The Creative Commons system requires that all the original stories and any adaptations must be distributed freely, and the wiki itself warns creators that they won’t be getting rich. That guaranteed legal safety, however, has turned SCP into a far bigger decentralized media universe than any NFT project. On top of its reports’ collaborative interlocking narrative, it serves as the source material for spinoff novels, video games, and short films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDczii"&gt;To some fandom veterans, NFT projects’ murky ownership questions mean collaborative blockchain storytelling doesn’t look like a revolutionary new medium, just the latest attempt to monetize fan labor. In late October, six young adult fiction authors &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/inside-realms-of-ruin-ya-novelists-failed-nft-project/"&gt;spurred a community backlash&lt;/a&gt; with a project called Realms of Ruin: a fantasy world where the authors would compose origin stories and fans would write tie-ins that they could mint as NFTs. It wasn’t clear who would control the copyright to these tie-in stories, and potential participants worried they were giving up legal ownership in exchange for blockchain tokens. The creators, apparently surprised by the negative response, shut down the project within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vNqN9T"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AXHlXR"&gt;It’s not clear that NFTs make it easier to craft new art from old art, nor that they would help settle common copyright conflicts. Countless copyright cases revolve around fair use, a situation where proving ownership is beside the point. Other cases, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691842/disney-marvel-sues-comic-artist-iron-man-avengers"&gt;Disney’s long feud with Marvel comics veterans&lt;/a&gt;, hinge on the precise terms of a contract. A blockchain &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help prevent works from being “orphaned,” or dropped into a limbo where the rightsholder can’t be found, except that cryptocurrency owners &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/tens-of-billions-worth-of-bitcoin-have-been-locked-by-people-who-forgot-their-key.html"&gt;lose or forget keys all the time&lt;/a&gt; and many transactions are anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuVVo1"&gt;Meanwhile, trying to use NFTs as a proxy for copyright raises its own concerns. If you do something like buy a superhero avatar, write a comic book about the hero, and sell the underlying avatar, there’s no clear norm about whether the new buyer should expect the rights to your comic. If Netflix wants to make a TV series about that comic, it’s even less clear how many people it would need to sign a deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eNHpLw"&gt;And ultimately, while NFT owners might love their digital characters, companies still own the names and stories that give them meaning. “Are these individually owned NFTs going to hit Main Street? If you can’t use the Bored Ape Yacht Club name — you’re just a cool picture of a monkey. If you can’t use the Vogu name — you are just a cool picture of a robot,” says Trackzy. “We still have a long way, I think, for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube co-founder predicts ‘decline’ of the platform following removal of dislikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd7ssraebRp6KAN8yAq-Avc5Ums=/0x20:480x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154351/jawed_karim_at_the_zoo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim edited the description to YouTube’s first ever video (above) to make his opinion known. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkSkPL"&gt;Jawed Karim, the third co-founder of YouTube, has condemned the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773299/youtube-dislike-button-hide-public-count-numbers-small-creator-protection"&gt;removal of public dislike counts&lt;/a&gt; on videos, suggesting that the change will lead to YouTube’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwFVri"&gt;“Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed,” writes Karim. “The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mulkmj"&gt;YouTube made the change to its UI last week, saying it removed public dislikes in order to counter harassment and promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” But many YouTuber users and creators have criticized the decision, arguing that dislike counts give the community a way to express its preferences as well as quickly identify misleading and spam videos promoted by YouTube’s own algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQJyUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqE9cX"&gt;Karim has been getting his own message out in an unusual way: by editing the description to the first video ever uploaded to YouTube, a banal clip titled “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw"&gt;Me at the zoo”&lt;/a&gt; which stars the 25-year-old Karim himself. Karim originally edited the description of the video a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/13/youtube-me-at-the-zoo-dislike-protest/amp/"&gt;few days ago&lt;/a&gt; to read: “When every YouTuber agrees that removing dislikes is a stupid idea, it probably is. Try again, YouTube [face palm emoji].” But this morning he changed this description once again to give a more detailed condemnation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2RxyQ"&gt;“The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform,” writes Karim. “Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. [...] The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vySy4g"&gt;It’s not the first time Karim has used the “Me at the zoo” video as an informal billboard for his opinions on the platform. In 2013, when YouTube announced it would use Google Plus to power comments — a move which many saw as a way for the search giant to force increased engagement for its doomed social network — Karim &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/08/youtube-cofounders-first-public-comment-in-8-years-why-the-f-do-i-need-a-google-account-to-comment-on-a-video/"&gt;changed the video’s description&lt;/a&gt; to read: “why the fuck do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uddM4j"&gt;In his statement today, Karim compares the video in which Matt Koval, YouTube’s “creator liason,” &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kxOuG8jMIgI"&gt;announced the removal of dislikes&lt;/a&gt; to infamous footage of US soldier Jeremiah Denton, who was captured during the Vietnam War. In 1966, Denton was forced to give a television interview by his captors, during which he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/03/29/296211985/j-denton-fo"&gt;blinked in Morse code&lt;/a&gt; to spell out the word “torture.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHB4C"&gt;You can read Karim’s latest update in full below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="description"&gt;The spoken words did not match the eyes. The video reminded me of an interview Admiral Jeremiah Denton gave in 1966. I have never seen a less enthusiastic, more reluctant announcement of something that is supposed to be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4enGm"&gt;Calling the removal of dislikes a good thing for creators cannot be done without conflict by someone holding the title of “YouTube’s Creator Liaison”. We know this because there exists not a single YouTube Creator who thinks removing dislikes is a good idea — for YouTube or for Creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg5Gmb"&gt;Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed. Instead, there will be references to various studies. Studies that apparently contradict the common sense of every YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDLu0l"&gt;The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. The idea was never that all content is good. The idea WAS, however, that among the flood of content, there are great creations waiting to be exposed. And for that to happen, the stuff that’s not great has to fall by the side as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrdchD"&gt;The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre? Because nothing can be great if nothing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3HaD"&gt;In business, there’s only one thing more important than “Make it better”. And that’s “Don’t fuck it up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Uber’s latest subscription offers discounts on rides, food, and delivery for $10 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7dOHCFcBQAYy4Hra0lreMfXzYNY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154345/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LTTsu"&gt;Uber is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374105/uber-ride-pass-subscription-cities-us-price-food-delivery"&gt;no stranger to subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, offering Amazon Prime-style benefits for a monthly fee since 2018. Today, the company is rolling out its latest, dubbed Uber One, which is aimed at highlighting the company’s post-pandemic shift to food and grocery delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="116jZk"&gt;For $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year, Uber One members will get access to perks such as guaranteed pricing on rides and delivery, and discounts such as 5 percent off “eligible” rides, food, and grocery deliveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iC58tM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber One is targeted at the company’s most frequent — and loyal — customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hVOJ7y"&gt;Uber One members won’t have to pay a delivery fee for takeout and groceries, will have priority access to top rated drivers and couriers, and get $5 cash back on late deliveries. They’ll also get other “exclusive perks,” such as various promotions and “invite-only experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBwG8j"&gt;Uber One is targeted at the company’s most frequent — and loyal — customers, as most people will switch back and forth between Uber and Lyft in search of the right price. Uber wants to reward those customers who keep using its product, whether its for rides, food delivery, or both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xo6Mf6"&gt;Uber One will replace Eats Pass, the food delivery version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18042120/uber-ride-pass-monthly-subscription-cheap-fare"&gt;the company’s first customer subscription product&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2018. For $24.99 a month, Uber Pass subscribers get 10 percent off rides and 5 percent off delivery orders. Now, Eats Pass members will be automatically upgraded to Uber One at the start of their next billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9FMni"&gt;For Uber Pass members, there will be no changes to the plan, but if they wish to join Uber One, they would need to cancel Uber Pass and sign up for Uber One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will sell you iPhone parts to fix your own phone at home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cG_qw6mF0FCWwz8VDwJ9he1CJkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154312/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyEEYp"&gt;Apple is opening up iPhones and Macs to at-home repairs. The company plans to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;start selling parts and tools&lt;/a&gt; and offering instructions on how to repair Apple products at home, without having to bring them into a store or a third-party repair shop. Apple plans to start with the iPhone 12 and 13, followed by Macs with M1 chips. You’ll be able to replace the iPhone’s display, battery, and camera using parts from Apple at first, with other options coming later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZtWhO"&gt;This is a huge shift from Apple, which has historically been resistant to the right-to-repair movement and from any repairs happening outside of its own stores. Even this week, Apple was walking back software that prevented Face ID from working if customers replaced their own screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXbQYL"&gt;Apple is calling the program “Self Service Repair,” and it’ll launch “early next year” in the US and then expand to other countries. The company says the program is only meant for “individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,” and that most customers should still go to a professional. But Apple is at least now offering an option for the customers who do feel comfortable undertaking the repair on their own. Critically, making these repairs yourself won’t void a device’s warrant, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although damaging your device in the process still might.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest Pokémon remakes are perfectly fine versions of great games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4vstpPi_Pq0Vn3SRwe8DKIQQww=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154231/BDSP_Screenshot_32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcIE68"&gt;The past week or so has shown just how challenging the concept of a remake or remaster can be, whether we’re talking about games or TV shows. The remastered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, for instance, seemed like a slam dunk but has instead turned into a meme factory. Netflix’s take on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, has had to thread a tricky needle of remaining true to the anime while also standing on its own. So, while it may seem like faint praise, it’s important to say this about Nintendo’s latest &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; releases, which bring the classic &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;to the Switch: they’re perfectly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOIvTn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt;, as they’re called, are slightly upgraded versions of the games that first graced the Nintendo DS in 2006. The new versions follow the same simple story — you’re a budding pokémon trainer who ends up having to thwart a mysterious organization known as Team Galactic — in the beautiful Sinnoh region. You once again start out by choosing between a penguin, fire monkey, and a turtle with a twig growing out of its head. When they first came out, &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;really tested just how far the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; formula could stretch. They didn’t add all that much, and the story wasn’t particularly memorable, and yet… I couldn’t stop playing. What they lacked in originality the games made up for with a rock-solid adventure and lots of cool creatures to collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oJQOy"&gt;This all remains true with the remakes. I’ve played through the first few hours of &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels a lot like what I remember from the DS days. The most notable difference, of course, is how the game looks. Things are fully 3D, but instead of following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"&gt;the Switch games &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these remakes introduce a new chibi art style reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13457446/world-of-final-fantasy-game-rpg-ps4-vita"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUfstLb8ME17yVs_uZsESKEQOwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23020132/Pokemon_Brilliant_Diamond_and_Shining_Pearl___Screenshot_17.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rpf3lZ"&gt;One the one hand, the graphics actually feel pretty true to the originals; characters have big heads and teeny tiny bodies while running around the field, and then inexplicably are perfectly proportioned once you hop into battle. But it’s also a bit of an acquired taste. Personally I’m not all that into the super-deformed character designs, and there are some other visual quirks, like flat textures and strangely shiny floors inside just about every building. It looks alright in handheld mode, though I found it pretty ugly blown up on a television set. I was also struck by how small the towns and routes felt compared to more recent entries. But hey, at least the pokémon look normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDqH1x"&gt;If the visuals don’t bother you, the good news is that gameplay-wise this remake is great — and that’s because it changes very little from the original. If you’ve become bored by the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; formula over the years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698264/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-nintendo-switch"&gt;you should probably wait for next year’s &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looks to introduce something of an open world to the series. But if the standard &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; structure is still enough to excite you, there are few better options. The game even adds a few more modern quality-of-life improvements, most notably having EXP share — an item that lets all of the pokémon in your party, not just the one battling, earn experience — as a built-in feature from the get-go. This massively reduces the tedium of building a team and makes things like evolving a Magikarp into a less frustrating experience. There’s also an improved smartwatch that lets you use moves like Cut — necessary for bypassing certain obstacles — without having to teach them to a pokémon, which was always a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unAfcq"&gt;In a world where remakes, remasters, and reboots are both ubiquitous and often quite bad, it’s nice to have a game that doesn’t mess with things too much. Sure, I could’ve done with a different visual style. But there’s something really comforting about slipping back into a familiar experience and losing a few hours to the pleasant routine of catching them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KlYN0"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Shining Pearl&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launch on the Nintendo Switch on November 19th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tidal launches free streaming and splits HiFi into two plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JYK8xi"&gt;Tidal is making some significant changes to its subscription plans and introducing a free, ad-sponsored tier for the first time. The new Tidal Free plan launches today, is exclusive to the US, and the company says it offers “access to our entire music catalog and playlists, with limited interruptions.” Streaming quality tops out at 160kbps, however, so it’s not much for Tidal’s paid options on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGUnaR"&gt;As for those paid subscriptions, Tidal is upgrading its standard paid plan to include lossless and high-resolution audio. Now known as Tidal HiFi, the $9.99-per-month tier offers the improved music quality (up to 1411kbps) and also adds “offline capabilities, access to features like Tidal Connect and My Activity, which provides individualized daily listening insights.” With Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited now offering lossless at no extra cost, Tidal had little choice here but to match those services. The service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;now owned by Square&lt;/a&gt;, was among the first to make a big lossless push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9J1tu"&gt;But the company is also adding a new, third plan called Tidal HiFi Plus. It costs $19.99 monthly and will be home to Tidal’s most premium audio content. You’ll need HiFi Plus for “best-in-class immersive sound formats” including Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Audio tracks. Tidal’s Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) recordings are also reserved exclusively for the higher HiFi tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lrxHv"&gt;Separate from its consumer-facing news, Tidal is announcing some new initiatives it hopes could provide artists with some additional revenue from the fractions of scraps they normally receive from music streaming services. Here’s what those will entail, according to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JQbhGG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct-to-artist payments:&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning today, TIDAL will launch monthly direct-to-artist payments. This innovative program will give artists access to an additional payment stream, so they can benefit directly from their biggest fans on TIDAL. Each month, a percentage of HiFi Plus subscribers’ membership fees will be directed towards their top streamed artist, which they will see in their activity feed. This direct-to-artist payment is in addition to their streaming royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8aabG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fan-centered royalties:&lt;/strong&gt; Starting in 2022, TIDAL is taking a different approach on royalties. In this new model, royalties attributed to HiFi Plus subscribers will not be aggregated. Rather, royalties will be paid based on the actual streaming activity of individual HiFi Plus subscribers as opposed to the industry accepted method of aggregating streams, empowering fans to play a larger role in the success of their favorite artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PlqaYh"&gt;These new efforts sound promising in concept and definitely shake things up — particularly the fan-centered royalties — but keep in mind that Tidal is only pulling this extra money from subscribers on its top-tier HiFi Plus plan. The regular Premium / HiFi plan isn’t contributing to direct-to-artist payments or fan-centered royalties. In an unsurprising bit of corporate synergy, Tidal says it’ll be working with Square, Cash app, and also PayPal “to ensure quick and seamless payouts to artists globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODbrdT"&gt;All of this comes as Spotify HiFi, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;nearly nine months ago&lt;/a&gt; at this point, has still yet to launch. Spotify has only said that its lossless tier is expected to be available “later this year.” The company has made no official comment on whether, like its competitors, it will also support Dolby Atmos and other new music formats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medical photography is failing patients with darker skin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iaXVgduCMKFTJvFhte5O6QVUmSs=/0x0:4724x3149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154198/1041978360.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Even medical stock photos only depict white people&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GRYf5M"&gt;Doctors aren’t usually in the business of publishing photography guides. But Jenna Lester, a dermatologist at the University of California San Francisco, was growing frustrated with the poor quality images she’d receive of her dark-skinned patients. It wasn’t just a cosmetic issue — the bad photos meant darker-skinned people weren’t getting the same quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MWRk6"&gt;So in January, Lester co-authored a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.19811"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Dermatology&lt;/em&gt; that gives a step-by-step guide to photographing skin of color accurately in clinical settings. Lester, who herself is Black, said, “I feel like these issues and my life is constantly me saying, ‘Hey, what about us?’ ‘What about these patients?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFWq9h"&gt;Medical photographs are vital to documenting disease in textbooks and journals and training medical students. If they’re not accurate — if, for example, they misidentify important characteristics like texture and color — doctors don’t get as clear a picture of what disease looks like on different people. It then becomes harder for medical professionals to spot potential conditions in their patients. This contributes to disparities in health outcomes for patients of color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeK3xz"&gt;“Across different aspects of medicine, patients with darker skin are getting lower access to screening, delayed diagnoses — and when they are diagnosed, it’s more often at a point where the disease is more severe or higher stage,” says Daniel Cho, a plastic surgery fellow at the Children’s Hospital for Philadelphia. For instance, the skin cancer known as melanoma, although comparatively rarer in Black people, is significantly more likely to kill them. The 5-year survival rates in Black and white individuals are 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="INhzy9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“when they are diagnosed, it’s more often at a point where the disease is more severe or higher stage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="30cVBw"&gt;Bad photos of dark skin aren’t specific to medicine. Bias has plagued photography since the days of film cameras. Before the advent of commercial digital photography in the late 1990s, lab technicians in camera stores would color-calibrate film by comparing a customer’s photos to a standard called a “&lt;a href="https://cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2196/3069"&gt;Shirley Card&lt;/a&gt;.” Named after Shirley Page, the original model who was pictured, these cards were used to ensure the color, hue, and tone of a customer’s image remained consistent and balanced against the so-called default photo. That default was whiteness, as almost all the Shirley Card models were white. This made it harder for photographers to accurately depict details of darker hues. The chemical coatings on photos also weren’t designed to be sensitive to non-Caucasian flesh tones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUYgNk"&gt;The result was that in photos with dark- and light-skinned people together, the darker-skinned person’s features were often erased, lacking the fine detailing afforded to the fair-skinned people. In the mid-1990s, Kodak began introducing multiracial Shirley Cards in an attempt to expand their global reach, which improved the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izgUjo"&gt;Since then, digital photography technologies have evolved. For instance, cameras that can balance two different skin tones within the same image now exist and make it easier to represent a greater variety of skin tones at the same time. But the idea of whiteness as the standard in photography has prevailed — creating serious problems, especially in medical photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNVl32"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the idea of whiteness as the standard in photography has prevailed — creating serious problems, especially in medical photography&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TMgKMu"&gt;Within highly visual medical fields like dermatology and plastic surgery, physicians rely heavily on photographs of a patient’s skin to aid in diagnoses and treatment plans. But images of conditions on light skin are overrepresented in medical journals and textbooks. That’s problem number one, Lester says. “Problem number two is if you only see one tone of non-white skin. And problem number three is that if that tone of non-white skin looks nothing like it would in real life, how do we make a diagnosis?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKoMPv"&gt;The issue of bad photos of dark-skinned patients is widespread. “I see terrible photos all the time of dark skin,” Lester says. “When I’m flipping through a patient’s chart, and I’m trying to monitor disease over time, the photos that other people have taken have not been great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DopFBG"&gt;For instance, a bad photo of inflammation on dark skin may make the already subtle condition difficult to see. In a person of color, the use of a flash or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;bad lighting can drown out the problem, and the inflammation may seem to blend into the skin. On the other hand, a well-captured image of the same taken near a window using natural light could allow a clear distinction between healthy and unhealthy skin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xcd60"&gt;Lester says the best photos come out of health systems with specialized photography departments, which are rare. Most clinical photos are taken by well-intentioned doctors who haven’t been trained in the nuances of photographing patients of different races. There are fundamental differences in the physics of how light interacts with different skin tones that can make documenting conditions on skin of color more difficult, says Chrystye Sisson, associate professor and chair of the photographic science program at Rochester Institute of Technology, the only such program in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Yr8OS"&gt;Interactions between light, objects, and our eyes allow us to perceive color. For instance, a red object absorbs every wavelength of light except red, which it reflects back into our eyes. The more melanin there is in the skin, the more light it absorbs, and the less light it reflects back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmRofG"&gt;“If you wrote with a red pen on white paper, the white paper reflects all those wavelengths back at you to appear white, and the red pen stands out in comparison,” says Sisson. Darker paper, though, absorbs more light. If someone writes with the same pen on that darker paper, the red reflection doesn’t stand out as much. That’s why some red skin conditions like inflammation or rosacea can appear more subtle on darker skin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QHceRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some red skin conditions like inflammation or rosacea can appear more subtle on darker skin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkkI7n"&gt;But standard photographic setups don’t account for those differences. For instance, although many &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2758218"&gt;medical journals&lt;/a&gt; recommend using flash for photographing patients, it can compromise detail when done on dark skin. The contrast of the bright flash of the camera against dark subjects can make dark things appear darker than they are, reducing detail in dark skin. The reflection of the flash back from the skin can also obscure the skin tone underneath and leave a shine, an effect that is more pronounced on darker skin. “Whatever standard setup you come up with needs to take that into account,” Sisson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdiosR"&gt;These biases may also be increasingly cemented within new technologies, like artificial intelligence algorithms that are trained to detect conditions using clinical photographs. Google Health &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that it is hoping to pilot an AI-powered dermatology assistant tool to assess skin conditions and provide access to authoritative information on them. The company trained a deep learning algorithm on a set of over 16,000 pictures of various skin conditions. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3#MOESM1"&gt;only 3.5%&lt;/a&gt; of these cases depicted dark and deep brown skin. Out of these photos of dark skin, it’s impossible to tell how many of them were taken using techniques that make sure they’re truly representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i06dMx"&gt;Clinical images are also frequently used in teaching materials, meaning the next generation of medical professionals is being trained with a scarcity of representative photos. And as telehealth becomes increasingly important, patients will need to be taught how to take accurate images of their conditions — which becomes hard when even their doctors don’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwekeq"&gt;The consequences of these compounded issues are what motivated Lester to compile the set of tips for photographing skin of color in a medical context — instructing people to pay close attention to lighting and choosing the color of background drapes carefully, along with other techniques. Lester hopes that her guidelines will prompt others in the field to question what “standard” practice means and who it was built for and serve as a stepping stone in bridging health equity gaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NBxbp8"&gt;“Recognizing that there are nuances and differences is an important first step in making the necessary adjustments to having a photograph that looks representative,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is already discounting the AirPods Pro, Google Nest Mini, and a host of other products ahead of Black Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few.

  &lt;p id="K6KslT"&gt;If you’ve been tracking Amazon’s lead-up to Black Friday like we have, you’ve likely seen the online retail giant rebrand its “Deal of the Day” page to “Epic Daily Deals” and now “Early Black Friday Deals.” We’re nearly on the precipice of full-on Black Friday sales everywhere — when that landing page will be transformed yet again — but there’s already a lot to consider if you plan on getting your holiday shopping done early. In fact, Amazon has a slew of deals worth jumping on now if time is of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh61Pd"&gt;Below are a variety of deals worth your time and attention, especially if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber.

    <title>Clean energy faces its own supply chain crisis </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="riKV7J"&gt;The future of energy in America will depend on whether the US can break free from its dependence on other countries that dominate clean energy supply chains. To reach the Biden administration’s energy and environmental goals, the US will have to dramatically scale up its mining and manufacturing, lawmakers argued today during a joint &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-securing-americas-future-supply-chain-solutions-for-a-clean"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; of the House Energy Subcommittee and the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee. They also raised serious concerns about the US’s ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yzpDE"&gt;“The sustainable economy of the future will definitely need to be built and manufactured. The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans,” said Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) in his opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ToGwIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H450wl"&gt;Joe Biden has pledged to get the US on a path to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a key target that climate scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; as necessary to stave off catastrophic effects of climate change. On the way there, Biden envisions a 100 percent “clean” power sector by 2035. He also wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;half of all new cars&lt;/a&gt; sold in 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG5tuP"&gt;Those ambitions, however, will depend on the US’s ability to get enough solar panels, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and other critical clean energy technologies and raw materials. But supply chains for these technologies, and for the raw materials like lithium and cobalt that underpin them, are largely concentrated overseas. This was already creating challenges for the US before the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22757240/global-supply-chain-management-shortage-covid"&gt;screwed up supply chains&lt;/a&gt;, and there are even bigger hurdles to overcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gidJ0J"&gt;The supply chain for solar panels is an illustrative example. Only 3 percent of solar photovoltaic modules shipped around the world in 2020 were made in the US. Mining and manufacturing for solar power technology is concentrated in China. &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Briefing%20Memo_ECCENG_2021.11.16_0.pdf"&gt;Sixty-three percent of polysilicon, a key material in solar panels, is produced in China. Seventy-nine percent of solar cells are built in China.&lt;/a&gt; The US mines some polysilicon but, without domestic facilities, sends it to China to be processed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9leP0"&gt;By 2020, the International Energy Agency had crowned solar energy “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514902/solar-energy-cost-historic-low-energy-agency-outlook-2020"&gt;the new king&lt;/a&gt;” of electricity supply because of falling costs and its projected growth over the next several years. But pandemic-induced inflation and supply chain bottlenecks now threaten that progress, according to an October &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Rystad Energy. Rising costs now jeopardize more than half the projected capacity of new utility-scale solar projects planned for 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frnBX0"&gt;Other clean energy technologies and raw materials are similarly vulnerable to global shocks and are dominated by China or a handful of other countries. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-faces-uphill-climb-to-rival-chinas-rare-earth-magnet-industry-11618133603"&gt;rare earth elements&lt;/a&gt; used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines and the lithium inside electric car batteries.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Department of Energy released a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524663/us-lithium-battery-supply-chain-broken"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” to boost domestic production of lithium batteries back in June. Without any interventions, a previous &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that US battery production capacity&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wouldn’t be able to meet even half of the projected demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles in 2028 as more people leave gas-powered cars behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PknZkV"&gt;Republicans and Democrats sparred with each other and with experts who gave testimony over the feasibility&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of Biden’s timeline for a clean energy transition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;given the supply chain challenges. “We can produce more and more of these products that we use for renewable energy, but we can’t get it done on the timelines that are being put out,” Congressman Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) said. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) described the clean energy transition as a “rush to green radical agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsDnOd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTktap"&gt;“Only here in the US is this viewed as a rush,” Ethan Zindler, head of Americas at energy research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance, who gave expert testimony, shot back. “We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kRl5d"&gt;To achieve its energy aims, Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill into law this week that invests in electric vehicle charging stations and funds a big overhaul of the US electric grid. If Democrats manage to pass an even larger spending bill languishing in Congress, an even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759985/biden-budget-reconciliation-infrastructure-bills-power-grid-climate"&gt;bigger investment in clean energy&lt;/a&gt; could be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiKl4P"&gt;Republicans slammed Democrats for boosting spending for clean energy while Americans face higher costs for oil and gas during a global supply pinch. Democrats defended the infrastructure legislation, calling it a “counter-inflationary” measure that would create jobs and make the US competitive against China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Fzov"&gt;Another point of contention was whether the US should dig up more critical minerals on its own land. That would decrease dependence on outside sources, but it poses potential threats to the local environment and nearby communities. The largest lithium resource in the US, for example, sits on land and a potential gravesite &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;held sacred by &lt;/a&gt;members of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Nevada. Activists are also &lt;a href="https://www.sierranevadaally.org/2021/05/20/people-of-red-mountain-statement-of-opposition-to-lithium-nevada-corps-proposed-thacker-pass-open-pit-lithium-mine/"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; that a proposed mine at that site, called Thacker Pass, could harm local wildlife and exacerbate a water shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK3YRd"&gt;“We’re restricting mining in America to acquire these critical minerals that we need for renewables, but you don’t like getting them from China or the Congo,” Representative David McKinley (R-WV) said. “I have to say you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIVaqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvPz9O"&gt;An expert from Redwood Materials, a lithium battery recycling company founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, advocated for building up the US’s battery recycling capacity as an alternative solution to the US’s supply chain woes. “Quickly ramping a domestic battery material supply chain using the highest possible percent of local recycled raw materials is the best way we can help meet the US’s energy goals,” said Jackson Switzer, director of business development at Redwood Materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EZNni"&gt;The hearing went on for over four hours as lawmakers probed everything from China’s history of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-xinjiang-solar/"&gt;labor abuses tied to solar panels&lt;/a&gt; to how to ensure that clean energy comes with good jobs in the US. While Biden has made well-paid jobs a central talking point of his clean energy agenda, witnesses reminded lawmakers that all the talk still needs to turn into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcz8TZ"&gt;“I’ve spent a lot of time over the last 15 years testifying and speaking on panels about the hope of the clean energy economy for my members and really for domestic industry,” Roxanne Brown, international vice president at large for United Steelworkers, said in her expert testimony. “And it’s been too long to be having this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
