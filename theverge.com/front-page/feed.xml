    <title>If audio is missing from your Instagram Stories, a fix is here</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naTnU7"&gt;Following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 update&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;have reported strange behavior on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — when an iPhone’s ringer switch is set to silent mode, stories play without audio. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;A new update released on Friday&lt;/a&gt; appears to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVHNp9"&gt;Silent videos might sound like a blessing for friends who love to put every new song Spotify suggests to them in their Instagram Story, but that’s not exactly how the switch is supposed to work. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;Silent mode is primarily meant to control system sounds&lt;/a&gt; like ringtones and text tones, not the audio you hear inside apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fYb3oH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is working on a fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFWyN"&gt;Before the update, I was able to recreate the behavior on my own iPhone running iOS 15. For some users, the issue popped up even earlier during the public beta of Apple’s software update. It’s not clear if this issue impacted users running older versions of iOS, and Facebook didn’t confirm if the issue was specifically related to iOS 15. The company did provide the following statement promising a fix, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dRYHtH"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble hearing their audio in Instagram Stories. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KO1BY"&gt;As of Friday, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;the update is available to download&lt;/a&gt;, and at least on my device, the problem is gone. Audio plays in Instagram Stories with the ringer off after a press of the volume button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC4ENM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/24 12:48PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Instagram’s update that fixes the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChkja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7SQeS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei CFO has reportedly made the plea deal that will finally let her go home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TxP6A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-brooklyn-federal-court-2021-09-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-wanzhou-us-court-1.6188093"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou will appear in a Brooklyn federal courtroom today via streaming and plead guilty to US charges against her. Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18128057/huawei-cfo-canada-arrest-iran-sanctions-violation"&gt;arrested the Chinese executive in December 2018&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of violating US sanctions, and she has remained there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18134938/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-bail-house-arrest-us-china"&gt;on house arrest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, fighting US attempts at extradition. Hearings in her extradition case ended in August, with the ruling scheduled for October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKzs4A"&gt;Meng was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;indicted on fraud charges claiming the Chinese technology and telecommunications company misrepresented its relationship with an Iranian affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, along with accusations it stole intellectual property from T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46hhwq"&gt;Spokespeople for the US Attorney’s Office and Huawei have not commented publicly on the matter. According to the &lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt; sources, Meng will pay a fine as part of a plea deal, while &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says the agreement reached with US prosecutors will allow her to leave Canada and return to China. A former Canadian diplomat told the &lt;em&gt;CBC &lt;/em&gt;he expects her release would lead to China deporting two Canadians it arrested and charged with espionage following Meng’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIHHw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-deal-with-huawei-executive-11632494001?st=n81fv8iy9e669cs&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that prosecutors will arrange to defer and later drop the charges in exchange for admitting some wrongdoing. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Justice Department officials under the Biden administration revisited negotiations that had broken down under President Trump. Its sources report that Huawei itself is not a part of the deal and will continue to fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185771/huawei-trade-secrets-charges-federal-investigation"&gt;its charges of fraud and trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s central bank bans cryptocurrency transactions to avoid ‘risks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s86HgiiJu25QCboxUsPaX7n1A94=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903772/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZowYTL"&gt;The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, &lt;a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4348556/index.html"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; that cryptocurrency transactions are illegal, saying such currencies “do not have legal tender status” and therefore “cannot be circulated as currency in the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnH7Fk"&gt;In a statement, the bank said that bitcoin and other virtual currency transactions have disrupted economic and financial order, contributing to a rise in “money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and other illegal and criminal activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW3flT"&gt;Crypto transactions are now considered criminal financial activity in China, the bank said, and the country will “resolutely curb the hype of virtual currency transactions, severely crack down on illegal financial activities and illegal criminal activities related to virtual currencies, protect the safety of the people’s property in accordance with the law, and make every effort to maintain economic and financial order and social stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXuPEk"&gt;Friday’s announcement is the culmination of an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;crackdown on crypto&lt;/a&gt; in the country; the Chinese government began issuing warnings about trading in mining cryptocurrencies in May, and in June, the bank &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/21/china-says-banks-must-block-crypto-transactions-market-falls/"&gt;told financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; to stop processing digital currency transactions. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that one major reason for the Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrencies is the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;energy needed to mine cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; transactions. China is in the midst of an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/global-energy-crunch-leaves-china-facing-more-power-shortages?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;energy crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has already affected many other industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOBaWY"&gt;Cryptocurrency prices were down &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwifoYvH75fzAhXkF1kFHUmRC0YQ-fUHegQICBAS"&gt;sharply in late-morning trading&lt;/a&gt; following China’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWeuXMt7N7rde9EUNmOF4cRROwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903718/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLI4SC"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is out Friday, and while it has a number of welcome improvements over the 12 Mini, it shares one limitation with its predecessor: the 13 Mini is still limited to peak power delivery of up 12 watts over MagSafe wireless charging, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-mini-12w-magsafe/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That means it, like the 12 Mini, has a lower maximum MagSafe charging speed than the rest of the iPhone 13 lineup, which can all charge at up to 15 watts over MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHvjDm"&gt;While it might be disappointing to hear that the smallest iPhone can charge slower over MagSafe, it does have improved battery life. Apple says you should get up to 1.5 hours more battery life than you would with the iPhone 12 Mini, so you may not need to charge the 13 Mini as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MASWUp"&gt;That said, the 13 Mini offers less battery life than the rest of the iPhone 13 models, and it can still run out quickly. Here’s Dieter Bohn’s early impressions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;from his review&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Gig work is precarious no matter the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Zomato delivery man seen riding along the streets of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FTUMnl_OSix0Ze1lmEqhSAkdaU=/0x0:3978x2652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903538/1233964644.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YV0bBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;The lives of delivery workers in major US cities&lt;/a&gt; are dangerous, surprisingly expensive, and largely only possible because of the support app-based laborers offer each other. But a &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;new editorial series from &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that the experiences of US-based gig workers aren’t unique — trying to make a living while at the whims of indifferent platforms is difficult no matter what country you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZCTJu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s overview is based on a survey of over 4,000 gig workers across the world. The publication’s findings are extensive — there’s plenty to examine from just about every angle you can imagine — but &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"&gt;the similarities drawn between workers in different countries&lt;/a&gt; is striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GOCQDu"&gt;Many [workers] — more than 60% — said that they were financially satisfied. But, at the same time, 62% also said that they were frequently anxious and scared on the job, afraid of accidents, assaults, illness, or simply not making enough money to cover their costs. More than two-thirds of the workers surveyed by &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; said they want out within a year. More than a quarter said they were planning on quitting within a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J5c5c9"&gt;Those parallels appeared in another aspect of platform work the series analyzes: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/"&gt;the treatment of women in the gig economy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; found women’s historically marginalized status in traditional economies was replicated on apps and platforms. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;survey indicated&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;women worked fewer hours — and many had caregiving duties on top of gig work. They also worked lower-paying gigs and “earned less overall ... than their male counterparts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsDdSU"&gt;The gig economy’s strangling, kudzu vine-like spread is &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/"&gt;largely possible because of massive sums of money from investment funds&lt;/a&gt; and, sometimes, other platform companies. Individual profiles included in the series further highlight that reach: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-telemedicine-doctor-india/"&gt;a doctor working on a telehealth app&lt;/a&gt; in India, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-delivery-driver-south-korea/"&gt;a delivery worker dealing with back pain&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea, and more. There’s too much to possibly summarize in one place, which is all the more reason why you should &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;check out the entire &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; series here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHXepk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGV77r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akcmkp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aynC8Q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUL6FT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Grimes are now ‘semi-separated’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-FASHION-METGALA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8O45As2Z3L5VBpKLKShhuIALqI=/0x107:4018x2786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903455/955815456.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KftewP"&gt;Elon Musk and Claire “Grimes” Boucher have “semi-separated,” according to the SpaceX founder. Musk &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/09/24/elon-musk-and-grimes-break-up-after-three-years-together"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that the two would continue to co-parent their one-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, but that working in different parts of the country had led to them taking more separate paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIyMno"&gt;“We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently, and are on great terms,” Musk told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas, and her work is primarily in LA. She’s staying with me now, and Baby X is in the adjacent room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcHUCw"&gt;The two started dating in 2018 after an exchange about a thought experiment popular in the tech world known as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evkgvz/what-is-rokos-basilisk-elon-musk-grimes"&gt;Roko’s Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly became one of the more unusual couples in their shared domain of tech-pop-space-travel-AI-and-miscellaneous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcStJR"&gt;They made their debut together on the red carpet of&lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/elon-musk-grimes-met-gala"&gt; the Met Gala in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though they arrived separately at this year’s event. The pair had a child together in May last year named X Æ A-Xii, baffling many with the pronunciation of the name (it’s “X Ash A 12,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/7/21251107/elon-musk-baby-name-x-ae-a-12-grimes-son-pronunciation"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;). They worked together when Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427429/elon-musk-snl-clips-wario-dogecoin-monologue-saturday-night-live"&gt;hosted &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a sketch in which the billionaire tech founder played Wario, and the pop star appeared as Princess Peach. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making Elizabeth Holmes’ cringey texts public is the ultimate crime deterrent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Executives Elizabeth Holmes And Sunny Balwani Return To Court" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkeWf3YDYCAWK21RJMi8WAW8Qx0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903373/1158861261.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pcbooj"&gt;The Elizabeth Holmes trial has made me more determined than ever to avoid doing crimes. I’ll be sticking to the law from here on out, thank you very much. It’s not for any noble reason — I don’t have any new sense of morality or sudden desire to be a very good person. No, I am zealously sticking to the law because doing crimes could, theoretically, put me in the same position disgraced Theranos founder Holmes is in right now: having my text message history revealed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFREXJ"&gt;Dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/TxB90dEbjHdvfu8KEjdl"&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt; between Holmes and her ex-boyfriend (and ex-business partner) Sunny Balwani were read aloud during Holmes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;trial for fraud&lt;/a&gt; this week. Thousands were released by the prosecution and more were &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/elizabeth-holmes-private-text-messages-leak-during-theranos-fraud-trial.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the messages talked about problems with the blood testing technology, which might help prosecutors show that Holmes knew that they didn’t work as advertised. Others were much more... personal. Like when Holmes texted Balwani “you are the breeze in desert for me.” Now, along with the “might go to jail” thing, Holmes has to live with the knowledge that everyone knows she sent that text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8N3O7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I would plead guilty to crimes I didn’t even commit before I let this get read aloud in court jfc&lt;/p&gt;— Maladroithe (@Maladroithe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Maladroithe/status/1440826183365455876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wQW3fw"&gt;I am not sure if I’m being hyperbolic when I say that is my very worst nightmare. I can confidently say that I’ve never told someone that they’re the breeze in the desert, but my text history is still embarrassing as hell. Isn’t everyone’s? Mine is full of bad tweets and shit talking and screenshots that should never, ever see the light of day. Searching for the word “murder” in iMessage brings up dozens of results, most of which are in conversations about online dating. Here are some moderately-cringe-but-not-too-terrible messages I’ve sent recently:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Why does he look like a caricature of what Jonathan Franzen should look like. Does that make sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cpdBjLyvN675SI1ZMN6EROb1Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874847/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this embarrassing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Wow ya. Twilight is so relevant" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcxP4LIm-ts4yht_gcYg_YJUfT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874856/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, I stand by this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qCO0kM"&gt;And I got to carefully curate these! I got to comb through and pick only a few messages that I thought would help communicate that I am someone who sends somewhat embarrassing texts but am not TOO weird. Holmes just had everything dumped on the internet, for anyone to see. I asked a friend what she would do if that happened to her. “Hang myself I assume,” she responded, in another dubious (and to be clear, exaggerated)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;entry into both of our iMessage histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6kU8E"&gt;If very high-profile public trials like this one can be a deterrent against other people committing crimes like the ones Holmes is accused of, this one is working. I can confidently say I will not develop an inaccurate medical testing device and defraud investors. I am going to be very, very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io4zyv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s Friday, here are fat baby bears </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brown Bear mother with cub, Ursos arctos, Katmai Alaska" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b9O1y7uIa_qWdx-KYcqjloWihv8=/9x0:5111x3401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903369/1140444226.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aTwkRh"&gt;I don’t know about you, but pumpkin spice lattes just aren’t cutting it for me as motivation to get excited about the fall. One thing I can rally around: fat baby bears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb3hSF"&gt;There’s an adorable twist this year to Katmai National Park’s &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-week.htm"&gt;annual Fat Bear Week&lt;/a&gt;. Today is the final day to cast your vote for its “&lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-junior-2021.htm"&gt;junior&lt;/a&gt;” competition. Four cubs faced off yesterday for a chance to compete against the grown-ups when Fat Bear Week officially starts on September 29th. Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1441208427045277703"&gt;only two cubs remain&lt;/a&gt; in the final round of junior voting; the cub who garners the most votes today will move on to the Fat Bear Week bracket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2qBq08"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10771098"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fT37qF"&gt;The park identifies the cubs by their mothers. You can cast your vote for Bear 128’s yearling, who already has the distinction of catching more leaping salmon at the lip of the park’s Brooks Falls than any cub in the park staff’s recent memory. It’s not a skill most cubs master before the tender age of two, according to the park. Or, you can choose Bear 132’s spring cub, who weighs in at more than 60 pounds before even turning one year old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7NOogZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10771103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LBnDXP"&gt;With these two cuties in the running, you really can’t make a bad decision when casting your vote (&lt;a href="https://explore.org/fat-bear-week"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; are open between 12PM to 9PM ET). You’ll find more information and photos of each cub’s transformation as they packed on the pounds this summer on Katmai’s &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-junior-2021.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/KatmaiNPP/?ref=page_internal"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages. And you can search for them on the park’s &lt;a href="https://explore.org/livecams/brown-bears/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls"&gt;bear cams&lt;/a&gt;. You can spot Yearling 128 by her signature blonde ears and Spring Cub 132 by his big, slouchy, brown belly and shaggy, dark brown fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ItM4q"&gt;There are elimination rounds each day of Fat Bear Week until a final chunky champion is named on Fat Bear Tuesday, October 5th. It’s essentially an online popularity contest meant to celebrate the Alaskan brown bears’ full figures. Winter is coming and a fat bear is a prepared bear. The bears eat an entire year’s worth of food in just six months to get ready for hibernation. Over the winter, they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;might lose a third of their body weight, but they’ll start bulking up for next year’s competition come spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California will require all autonomous vehicles to be zero-emission starting in 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4fngUPqQRbrt5SQWfKVwUa-YQo=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903238/vpavic_4412_20210111_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3EVeb7"&gt;California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles (AV) to emit zero emissions starting in 2030. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/"&gt;On Thursday, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law&lt;/a&gt; a bill sponsored by environmental groups that would eventually prohibit gas- and hybrid-powered autonomous vehicles from operating in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNFiSa"&gt;It was the latest move by Newsom to restrict the sale and use of internal combustion engine vehicles amid a broader effort to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the governor signed two executive orders: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304367/california-electric-trucks-vans-clean-air-pollution-mandatory-rule"&gt;one requiring all commercial trucks and vans&lt;/a&gt; sold in the state to be zero-emission starting in 2045 and another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;requiring only the sale of zero-emission passenger vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNPuqe"&gt;California was the first state in the US to prohibit the sale of nearly all fossil fuel-burning vehicles in its borders. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324552/electric-trucks-buses-clean-air-zero-emissions-states"&gt;At least 15 states have followed the state’s lead&lt;/a&gt;, passing similar measures that would apply to heavy-duty trucks, vans, and buses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GbG964"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California is the largest vehicle market in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RAx2Vw"&gt;California is the largest vehicle market in the US, with nearly 15 million registered vehicles on the road. AVs only account for a small fraction of that total amount, but some experts predict those numbers will grow as AVs become more capable and companies move to commercialize their use. Other groups have expressed worry that autonomous vehicles could usher in an era of even more traffic and pollution, especially if AVs are priced cheaper than public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJyX27"&gt;California is ground zero for AV testing in the US, with over 50 companies licensed to operate autonomous vehicles for testing purposes in the state. A handful of companies hold permits to test fully driverless vehicles, without safety drivers behind the steering wheel. And an even smaller number have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520227/cruise-permit-california-driverless-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;approved to pick up and drop off passengers&lt;/a&gt; as part of a commercial robotaxi service. AVs registered in California traveled approximately 1.99 million miles in autonomous mode on public roads in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpTrVz"&gt;The two companies that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276851/california-self-driving-autonomous-cars-miles-waymo-cruise-2020"&gt;comprise the bulk of that testing&lt;/a&gt;, Alphabet’s Waymo and GM-backed Cruise, both operate fully electric vehicles as part of their fleets. Waymo uses the Jaguar I-Pace SUV, as well as the non-electric Chrysler Pacifica minivan, though the company has declined to say exactly how many of each vehicle it owns. Cruise exclusively uses the Chevy Bolt, a vehicle that is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;subject to a massive recall&lt;/a&gt; because some of the batteries have been catching fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TGjAJ"&gt;“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero emissions fleet from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2wdd8"&gt;Environmental groups praised Newsom for signing the bill into law. The Union of Concerned Scientists, &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/california-bill-requires-all-new-self-driving-vehicles-be-zero-emission-2030"&gt;which helped sponsor the legislation&lt;/a&gt;, said it was a “smart policy to ensure that driverless vehicles don’t contribute to the problem” of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vVOzP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16748024/self-driving-electric-hybrid-ev-av-gm-ford"&gt;Some AV operators have argued&lt;/a&gt; that electric vehicles are a bad fit for self-driving cars because of the extended charging requirements. In order to make a profit, autonomous vehicles need to maximize their time on the road, delivering people or packages, otherwise they’re likely to be a money-loser, they argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZqzWd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated September 24th, 10:59AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include a statement from Cruise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyPEin"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vljlqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679389/iphone-13-apple-event-vergecast-podcast-467"&gt;Last week on the show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; went through all of the announcements at Apple’s fall hardware event. This week on the show, it’s review time! Nilay and Dieter are joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior editor Tom Warren to discuss what they learned from spending time with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. A bigger battery and a smaller notch: is it worth the upgrade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Lq015"&gt;The second half of the show is dedicated to another fall hardware event — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;this time from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, we saw a few new devices under the Surface line: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other upgrades. The crew discusses everything announced at the event, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwadPCebCQU"&gt;hands-on demo of the devices&lt;/a&gt; that Dieter was able to experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="163BBD"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxhxqf"&gt;There’s a whole lot more packed into the show — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;like an EU proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
