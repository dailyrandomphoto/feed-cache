    <title>How to make your home office a more pleasant place to work</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KRugiK"&gt;This pandemic has more people working from home than ever before, but it’s not all lollipops and daffodils. While there may have been some early excitement about not commuting or being breathed on by Chet the Xerox Tech, an actual home office can be downright depressing and / or uncomfortable. I should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue7mgc"&gt;As someone who has freelanced for the great majority of the last decade, I’ve worked from home nearly that whole time — even when home was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311668/how-to-live-your-best-vanlife"&gt;a camper van&lt;/a&gt; for more than five of those years. Yes, that was a tight space for a home office, but those constraints led me to refine my WFH game to keep my body healthy and my mind at least partially sane. Here are some of the tips (and items) that made the biggest difference for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lCf0Im"&gt;Desk setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I0xo2R"&gt;If you only do one thing on this list, make sure your desk and chair are comfortable. That’s broad advice, but it kind of has to be, because each body is different. What you find comfortable might be a medieval torture device to me. Case in point: I once bought a desk online that had rave reviews, but it turns out that if my chair is set to the proper height, the front of the desk digs into my thighs. Not ideal! So, if at all possible, try to sit at a desk before you buy it. You might also consider &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/jarvis-standing-desk.html"&gt;a standing desk&lt;/a&gt; which increases the number of positions you can work from. Personally, I couldn’t find one that worked with the rest of my setup (I’m a sucker for lots of drawers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqkkm"&gt;I’d argue that the chair is even more important than the desk. You’re going to want something ergonomic and with adjustable lumbar (lower back) support. Working hunched over &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200681/"&gt;can &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687016300515"&gt;destroy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15093-2"&gt;your &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/health-effects-of-poor-posture/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;, and your shoulders, your back, and your neck will all suffer. Chairs can cost a pretty penny, but they don’t have to. Craigslist, OfferUp, Nextdoor, and similar sites can be treasure troves for used office chairs. I read good things about the &lt;a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/"&gt;Herman Miller Aeron&lt;/a&gt;, so I went and tried it out in a store, then I found a gently used one on Craigslist for about 30 percent of the cost of a new one. You might also look into gaming chairs, as they are built for long periods of sitting. Just make sure it will fit with your desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LuY9vH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets"},{"title":"Our 14 favorite gadgets and hacks for working at home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252470/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vaGGQ4"&gt;Last for this section, let’s talk about what goes on top of your desk. Depending on the line of work you’re in, a second screen can be a real game-changer, so consider an extra monitor for your desktop or laptop. It allows for vastly easier multi-tasking with much less clicking around. If you use a laptop, it might be especially revelatory. Personally, I recently switched back to a desktop setup (a Dell tower with an Intel Core i7, an Nvidia RTX 3070 and 32GB of RAM, which has been great for photo and video editing as well as VR gaming breaks), and instead of two monitors, I went with one big one which I can divide into halves or quadrants. I chose the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeHomeOffice010422/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-monitor-u3219q/apd/210-aqzz/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell UltraSharp 32 4K monitor&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in love with it. If you don’t photo or video edit, you may not need something that high-end. The point is to give yourself more space to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jGDnji"&gt;Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mhdi9g"&gt;There are a bunch of different studies that explore how different shades of light can impact our minds and bodies. They could affect everything from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/color.html#:~:text=Blue%20light%20has%20the%20strongest,fall%20asleep%20and%20stay%20asleep."&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, to alertness, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130806203150.htm"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1779263/"&gt;our productivity at work&lt;/a&gt;. My best advice is to set up your office near a big window that gets decent light, but I know that isn’t always possible. The next best thing, in my view, is a set of color-changing lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv9GV5"&gt;Personally, I’ve been using &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglNJrOC3ot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue&lt;/a&gt; for years, and I even set them up inside my van, back when that was my home. Philips spent a lot of time working on its light recipes, and the system comes pre-programmed with “Energize” and “Concentrate” settings that I genuinely find useful. Personally, I use Energize when I first wake up, then Concentrate (which is slightly warmer) for the bulk of my workday. When I’m ready to start winding down I’ll switch it over to the Reading setting, which I find warm and relaxing. There are a lot of other brands of color-changing lights out there, and if they don’t have presets like those I mentioned, you can experiment with different shades of light (bluer for more alertness, redder for relaxing, or something like that). It’s a small thing, but it really makes a huge difference in the way your home office feels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FLKQD"&gt;Plants and animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzIIP7"&gt;There is something about surrounding yourself with living things that makes your home office feel more natural and less like a sterile shoebox. Having a few houseplants can really change the feel of the whole room, and they can even make the air slightly fresher. I would recommend putting them near your desk, but also close enough to a window so they get plenty of light. If that’s an issue, you can get a hydroponic garden — for example, I recently got the small &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frisegardens.com%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-indoor-garden&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rise Garden&lt;/a&gt;. I am bad with plants, but it enabled me to grow lots of fresh herbs which made my apartment smell amazing. If that feels excessive (or expensive) then you can just start with this cool-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=32566716924009&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22510721__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snake plant&lt;/a&gt; that we’re kind of obsessed with (it’s $35). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdkkCe"&gt;As far as animals, I know a lot of people who adopted pandemic puppies and kittens. That’s cool, and maybe that’s a great fit for your life, but it definitely wasn’t for mine. So, I got a hummingbird feeder called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSH7VA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the HummZinger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simple hummingbird feeder with several birds drinking at the flower-shaped holes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loBoIXWPwDkEAKqZxVCN3p1-3O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145255/414165.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Aspects&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HummZinger. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJQIQ"&gt;I got this one because it is simple, yet still has anti-ant and anti-fly protection. I am now obsessed. I can see the feeder from my desk, and whenever one of those little guys shows up, I stop what I’m doing and just watch. On days when I’m frying my eyeballs on my computer screen, it really helps me feel like I’m still a part of the natural cycle. You can get a regular bird feeder if you like, but I wasn’t interested in constantly cleaning bird poop off of my little outdoor space, and hummingbirds are nice and tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LChZF3"&gt;Take care of your body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sP6Sat"&gt;Eliminating your commute may actually have some negative impacts on your body, especially if your commute involved some amount of walking or biking. These days you could conceivably not leave your home for days on end, and being that sedentary really isn’t good for you. Get up and move, and get your heart pumping. You don’t need a fancy home gym. Get a yoga mat and watch some YouTube workouts that require only your body weight. Force yourself to go for walks, even when you don’t wanna. Stretch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7fiZ"&gt;I also tend to get a fair amount of knots in my shoulders (and in my legs if I actually go running). For those I really like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhyperice.com%2Fproducts%2Fhypervolt-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hypervolt 2&lt;/a&gt; massager. It is incredibly powerful, highly portable, and it comes with five different attachments for different stubborn muscles. Coming in at just under $300, it isn’t cheap, but it’s been worth it to me. The other thing I’m currently obsessed with is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38678&amp;amp;u1=VergeHomeOffice010522&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.llbean.com%2Fllb%2Fshop%2F65637%3Fpage%3Dmens-wicked-good-moccasins" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this pair of slippers from LL Bean&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just so warm and comfy I pretty much work in them all day, and then lounge in them the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OZZzzV"&gt;Snacks and meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dmKdFn"&gt;This is one of the trickiest items. Suddenly you have unfettered access to your fridge and snack cabinets, and it can be very tempting to just graze all day. So, what do you do? Here’s the strategy that has worked better for me than anything else: Fill your kitchen with healthy foods, and only healthy foods. Yep, really. If I wander into my kitchen, wanting a snack, and there are chips there, I’m going to eat those chips. But if I go there and the only snackable foods are carrots and sugar snaps, then that’s what I’m going to eat. Basically, I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony, and it really works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIO29e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdDXCu"&gt;Beyond the superficial reasons for eating healthier, doing so will lead to better, more sustainable energy levels, as opposed to spikes and crashes. Not only can I subjectively feel the difference, but when I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22794594/levels-health-glucose-fitness-tracker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed this continuous glucose monitoring system&lt;/a&gt; I was able to get hard data to back it up. When your kitchen is full of tasty but highly-processed foods, you have to have the willpower to make the healthy decision every time you want a snack. It’s easier to just be strong once, at the grocery store, and then you don’t have to make those tough decisions a dozen times a day in your own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4fdwBu"&gt;Calling it a day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ68uz"&gt;You’ve got to know when it’s time to quit, and then you need to step away. This used to be a more delineated status for a lot of us: If you were at the office you were working, and if you weren’t at the office then it was your personal time. Working from home makes those lines a lot blurrier. It can easily feel like work never stops or that you always have to be reachable. Set some limits for yourself for your own mental health. Get your work done, and when office hours are over, get up, and walk away from your computer for a while. You’ll be happy you did, and you’ll come back to your “office” tomorrow more refreshed and ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iwjx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPf0G1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new stream light is an affordable, convenient alternative to Elgato</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m011ShhmrxwhlmiQtQs0iGKLotQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378078/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blA3sN"&gt;Logitech’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Flighting%2Flitra-glow.946-000001.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22879811%2Flogitech-litra-glow-elgato" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Litra Glow&lt;/a&gt; is a small LED light that’s designed to illuminate you while you’re sitting at your desk. It’s designed primarily with content creators like Twitch streamers or YouTubers in mind, but should work just as well for smartening you up on a Zoom call. In other words, it looks like a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air"&gt;Elgato’s $129.99 Key Light Air&lt;/a&gt;, but at a more affordable $59.99 (€69) price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJKLPM"&gt;It’s not an identical accessory. Rather than having a large desk stand, the Litra Glow comes with a small mount to balance it on top of a monitor. It looks like it might be less versatile than the Key Light Air’s stand, but it could be more convenient if you want to reduce desk clutter. Power is provided via a USB-C port on its back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGohV5cs4-f2Gwu6uqUVOGr-4wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163163/tonzy_using_streaming_light.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light can be mounted on a monitor, and has physical hardware controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0kRBHZ"&gt;Both brightness and color temperature are adjustable, and the Litra Glow comes with five presets for different scenarios. Its settings can be adjusted using controls on the back of the light, or there are software controls available via Logitech’s G Hub software. Here, you can set up custom presets, and control multiple Litra Glows simultaneously. The light also integrates with Logitech’s keyboards and mice (of course), which can be set to control it with any available macro buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFS5s3"&gt;Logitech has been making a big push into the content creator market, and the Litra Glow is the latest evidence of this. The company has produced webcams alongside keyboards and mice for years, but more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/30/17633144/logitech-acquires-blue-microphones-announcement"&gt;has acquired Blue Microphones&lt;/a&gt;, makers of the popular Yeti and Snowball USB mics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20886060/logitech-streamlabs-obs-acquisition-twitch"&gt;as well as Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, which produces streaming software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzy0wp"&gt;The Litra Glow will be available  in the US, Canada, Australia and select countries in Europe from this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime launches its new electric bikes in Washington, DC as part of $50 million blitz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6g0DZ943HxU1opcvv9Tg1aN8wI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378017/DSC_0944.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ovjT90"&gt;Lime’s next-generation electric bikes are finally making their North American debut. Nearly a year after announcing its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303364/lime-ebike-expansion-new-cities-50-million-investment"&gt;spend $50 million on a major e-bike expansion&lt;/a&gt;, the San Francisco-based micromobility company says it will deploy the first wave of new bikes in Washington, DC, starting this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbnKWo"&gt;Lime says the new bikes are significantly improved over the ones currently in service, which the company inherited from Jump after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;acquiring the bike-share company from Uber&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. The $50 million investment will largely go toward designing, manufacturing, and assembling its next-generation bike, which start rolling out this year. The new model comes with a more powerful 350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25 miles of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qffORu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25 miles of range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pu2Ffy"&gt;In addition to a new dual-speed automatic transmission, the bikes also feature swappable batteries that are interchangeable with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627387/scooter-share-nyc-bronx-bike-lanes-injuries-lime-bird-veo"&gt;the company’s fleet of electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;. This will improve the customer experience, said Lime’s director of Mid-Atlantic and Northeast operations, by making it less likely that they’ll encounter vehicles with drained batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPrVca"&gt;“Now we can actually get the batteries quicker,” Lime’s Paul Holley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You don’t have as many low battery vehicles out in the field. Our task turnaround times are a lot quicker.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zT6tjckJChEE0HDDxwCzFit-9Ik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162079/DSC_0953.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d2g02X"&gt;The swappable batteries are certainly the most important new feature in Lime’s next-gen e-bike. Lime views the ability to swap batteries between scooters and bikes as not just good for customers but also its own bottom line. Lime saves money both by simplifying its manufacturing process and operationally by reducing the amount of work that needs to be done by its teams working in each city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUKxBS"&gt;“When you unify that battery ecosystem and you isolate it to a single battery, what that really does is it increases the density of the work that needs to get done out in the field,” Holley said. “So now you don’t necessarily have to have two separate teams that are kind of just running out in their own lane and just doing their own thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL1ks"&gt;Not every scooter and bike company is convinced. Bird, for example, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455384/bird-electric-scooter-third-gen-emergency-braking-battery"&gt;staked out an opposing position&lt;/a&gt;, arguing swappable batteries are typically smaller and hold less charge than non-swappable ones. The company has also argued that swappable batteries have a larger carbon footprint because they require more vehicle miles traveled to retrieve, replace, and recharge scooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jRGsY"&gt;Holley argued that swappable batteries don’t necessarily translate into less power or lower range; Lime can choose to install larger batteries if it wants. “We can do that within the context and the confines of a swappable battery ecosystem,” he said. “You can go up and down in terms of size and range and amp hours and all those types of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cfSHQA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not every scooter and bike company is convinced swappable batteries are the solution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mpK35U"&gt;There are other new features on the bike: the handlebars are being replaced with ones similar to Lime’s scooters, there’s a phone holder in the front basket, and the bike will be able to hit speeds of up to 20mph (depending on local regulations). It weighs 72 pounds, which is heavier than the 65-pound electric Citi Bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BESP9"&gt;I got a chance to try out one of Lime’s new bikes late last year. Riding the bike over from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan, I was impressed by the motor’s ability to dole out power. The boost was nearly instantaneous as far as I could tell, without any of the jerkiness or slow motor build-up of some lesser e-bikes. It’s far from the sexiest e-bike I’ve ever ridden, but that’s by design since Lime’s e-bikes are built for power, stability, and durability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7CogR"&gt;That said, I don’t think people who use bike-share will abandon their preferred e-bikes and flock to Lime’s new models. Bike-share is a tool of convenience, and customers generally use the bike that’s nearest to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QazEAe"&gt;Lime will keep its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355020/lime-jump-ebikes-app-share-rent-uber-scrapped"&gt;cherry-red Jump bikes in operation&lt;/a&gt;, with no plans to phase those out in favor of the new Lime-branded e-bikes. The company has stated that it wants to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;a multimodal provider of many different types of low-speed, electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers. And it also rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in several markets, including Paris and Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1T3qj"&gt;It’s great to see Lime investing in new technical specifications in an effort to broaden the offerings it has available in its app. Scooters are good for tourists or people who are out for a short jaunt. But bikes are better for longer distances, and e-bikes, in particular, are great at replacing car trips. In that respect, Lime will have a real powerful tool in its arsenal for its broader campaign to promote electric, zero tailpipe-emission transportation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ixKE1calLITAsumkOocGDVSJXM=/0x0:1599x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377904/Wyze_Labs_Inc_WyzeCam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wyze security camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tol4R4"&gt;Wyze has officially launched a new pay-what-you-want subscription tier for its lineup of home security cameras called Cam Plus Lite. In a &lt;a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that Cam Plus Lite includes Person Detection, which alerts you when it detects a human being rather than just motion, as well as cloud recordings that are limited to 12 seconds in length, with a 5 minute cooldown period between them. Users can choose to pay as little as $0 a month for the new tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzDtm6"&gt;Wyze also says it’s removing the 32GB microSD card size limit on its cameras, and is adding new rewind and skip buttons to make it easier to scrub through locally-saved footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcXfiz"&gt;Regarding subscriptions, Wyze started experimenting with its pay-what-you-want model for its person detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331974/wyze-cam-ai-person-detection-free-pay-what-you-want-model-experiment"&gt;back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, hoping (correctly) that some users would be willing to pay to allow Wyze to provide the service for free to others. Person detection was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687708/wyze-cam-people-detection-xnor-ai-firmware-update-announcement"&gt;originally added as a free service in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but the company was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985527/wyze-person-detection-ai-startup-canceled-removed-dropped"&gt;temporarily remove it the following year&lt;/a&gt; after the company providing its AI technology terminated its licensing deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067594/apple-acquires-xnor-ai-wyze-camera-people-detection-feature"&gt;when it was acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9kSPqB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cam Plus Lite sits below Cam Plus and Cam Plus Pro&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIzTnZ"&gt;Smart home companies are currently split on whether to charge for person detection. Google and Eufy currently offer similar features for free, while Arlo and Ring charge. Wyze’s big selling point has always been the affordability of its security cameras, and the $0 payment option helps to preserve that. Its Wyze Cam v3, for example, is currently &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-cam.html"&gt;on sale for just $35.98&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xbYSj"&gt;Cam Plus Lite sits below &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415235558939-How-does-Cam-Plus-Lite-compare-to-Cam-Plus-and-Pro-"&gt;Wyze’s other existing subscription tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Cam Plus and Cam Plus Pro. Cam Plus costs $1.99 per camera per month and removes the 12-second limit and 5-minute cooldown on cloud recordings while expanding the AI detection feature to also recognize packages, pets, and vehicles. Cam Plus Pro, meanwhile, costs $3.99 per camera per month and includes 24/7 professional monitoring, as well as the ability to recognize specific faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luKnnE"&gt;Cam Plus Lite will be &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415190129691-Is-Cam-Plus-Lite-the-same-as-Name-Your-Price-"&gt;available for&lt;/a&gt; Wyze Cam v2 and v3, Wyze Cam Pan v1 and v2, and Wyze Cam Outdoor. That’s an &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415190129691-Is-Cam-Plus-Lite-the-same-as-Name-Your-Price-"&gt;expansion compared to the cameras&lt;/a&gt; that had access to the previous pay-what-you-want subscription, which only included the Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan v1. Cam Plus Lite support for Wyze video doorbells will be coming soon, the company says. According to &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051682391-Can-I-use-Person-Detection-outside-the-US-"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Person Detection is not available outside of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PCIe 6.0 is coming for the speedy SSDs and GPUs of the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdeVMsGIbN6po_nyF9ZRTORefvQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377900/pciexpress6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CsEKcU"&gt;PCI Express 5.0 has only just started arriving on the consumer side, but the specification for PCIe 6.0 has just been finalized. The PCI Special Interest Group has published the &lt;a href="https://pcisig.com/pci-express-6.0-specification"&gt;final specs for PCIe 6.0&lt;/a&gt;, doubling the bandwidth over the 5.0 version up to a theoretical maximum bidirectional speed of 256GBps on an x16 slot (128GBps in a single direction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwYQvk"&gt;The first super fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs appeared&lt;/a&gt; just before this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, promising read speeds of up to 14GBps. That was already twice what we’re used to seeing with PCIe 4.0 drives, and with the doubling PCIe 6.0 brings we’d expect to see SSDs offer up to 28GBps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJJp3R5twPwQPtYysMp9uxIBxzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162982/wxCNoas.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PCI Special Interest Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;PCIe 6.0 vs. existing PCIe specifications.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i1DnLR"&gt;The PCI Special Interest Group has achieved the doubling of PCI Express speeds around every three years ever since the original introduction of the spec in 2003. PCIe 6.0 has overhauled the signaling technology to achieve the bandwidth gains this time, while maintaining low latency. It’s a move that &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17203/pcie-60-specification-finalized-x16-slots-to-reach-128gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as “a more significant overhaul, arguably the largest in the history of the standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC9vcx"&gt;The PCIe 6.0 architecture also maintains compatibility with all previous generations of PCIe. That will allow any existing hardware that uses earlier specifications to work in PCIe 6.0 hosts, and it will certainly help with adoption and the transition to this new specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7pXmT"&gt;While PCIe 5.0 is still in its infancy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860374/intel-samsung-ces-2022-demo-pcie-5-0-ssd-setup-speed-test"&gt;being demonstrated with enterprise-grade SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t expect to see PCIe 6.0 hardware for another 12 to 18 months. That means some servers will likely start to use the new spec at some point in 2023, with consumer hardware to follow in 2024 or 2025. Until then, get ready to hear a lot more about PCIe 5.0 SSDs, GPUs, and more throughout 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest phishing scam to watch out for: fraudulent QR codes on parking meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parking Meters On City Street In Reading Pennsylvania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maGG1bJ4Sq1NDlbdr_7LTqpfrB0=/0x108:4400x3041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377884/1331145067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ben Hasty/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzC1FZ"&gt;Police in several US cities are warning residents not to pay for their parking using QR codes stuck to parking meters. That’s because these codes have been placed there by scammers, who are using them to direct people to fraudulent sites that capture their payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9t0U"&gt;Warnings have been issued by law enforcement in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1473025923951775755"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; over the holiday period (we spotted the story &lt;a href="https://theoverspill.blog/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Overspill&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). Police say they discovered a number of stickers with illicit codes appearing on parking meters, while a report by local news site &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2022/01/05/qr-code-scammers-hitting-on-street-parking-in-texas-cities-this-is-what-houston-officials-want-you-to-know/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click2Houston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows how one of the fraudulent codes directed people to a site promising “quick pay parking.” (The site now appears to be offline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7nc2t"&gt;Police are advising anyone who inadvertently enters their credit card details into one of these sites to file a police report and contact their card vendor to reverse any payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ssWOco"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Scam Alert &lt;br&gt;APD Financial Crimes detectives are investigating after fraudulent QR code stickers were discovered on City of Austin public parking meters. People attempting to pay for parking using those QR codes may have been directed to a fraudulent website and made a payment. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Gb8gytCYn7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gb8gytCYn7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Austin Police Department (@Austin_Police) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXAiwF"&gt;Although once derided as an outdated technology, QR codes have become &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/style/qr-codes.html"&gt;increasingly visible&lt;/a&gt; in the West over the past few years. These two-dimensional barcodes are able to store snippets of data but are commonly used to direct people to URLs. They’ve been a staple of digital payments in Asia for many years, but have been embraced in the West during the pandemic, used to link people to restaurant menus, report vaccination status, and check in to locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CblYnQ"&gt;The convenience of QR codes (QR stands for “quick response”) is balanced by their lack of security. Although the code itself cannot be comprised, it can be used to direct people to fraudulent or dangerous sites, as with the parking meter scam. There’s no way for a human to “read” a QR code, and preview URLs created by mobile devices are often ambiguous at best. That makes them ripe targets for surprise or malicious redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi4ZjU"&gt;The advice for avoiding these scams is the same as for any phishing fraud: check the URL of the website you’ve been sent to for misspellings or less-than-professional design (not always a useful tell when it comes to local government sites). And in the case of parking fees, look for official apps which are commonly used in US cities to make such payments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many other apps like it on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eXFsor"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYQOJeNtNEEZB_72WBwboMnXZj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162051/IMG_3661.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 5PM ET today, showing two clones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBxGL0BzrKpXmt9N2ro0h_yUC18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162334/IMG_3666.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 8:08PM ET — the first results are now an app from five years ago, and a story about Words With Friends 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdr2q4"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for confirmation that it was the one that took action against the Wordle-alikes, but it seems vanishingly unlikely that each developer decided to take down their app in the space of about an hour. If Apple really is initiating a crackdown on the apps, it’s tipping the scales significantly to protect the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KGNEZ"&gt;While there have been similar high-profile situations in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/wordle-clone-ios-mobile-gaming"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;Threes vs 2048&lt;/a&gt; come to mind — it’s hard to think of a recent example where Apple stepped in as heavily as it seems to have done today. Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats"&gt;does have language about copycats in its developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s notably vague: “Come up with your own ideas,” section 4.1 reads. “Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ooG9T"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/"&gt;questions about how Apple would deal with blatant clones&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s seemingly let things slide in some instances. With disappearance of the Wordle-alikes from the App Store, we may have gotten a precedent for how similar is too similar. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family Controls) won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay, the carrier tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa5X2u"&gt;“Customers who chose plans and features with content filtering (e.g. parent controls) do not have access to the iCloud Private Relay to allow these services to work as designed. All other customers have no restrictions,” T-Mobile spokesperson Bennet Ladyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That tracks with Apple’s messaging around the feature, which notes that “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uuaZLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X5VL8i"&gt;T-Mobile’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find an issue with Apple’s recent iOS 15.2 update that caused iCloud Private Relay to be toggled off following the update. “Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnIzGG"&gt;If the problem really is on Apple’s end, it could also explain the issues that some Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customers may have been experiencing in the wake of the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68AKN"&gt;That said, it’s possible that carriers may sour on supporting Apple’s privacy feature in the future. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878885%2Fverizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, and T-Mobile have all signed a joint letter asking the European Commission to block Private Relay, arguing that the feature is “cutting off other networks and servers from accessing vital network data and metadata, including those operators in charge of the connectivity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZv0Sy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;iCloud Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to a VPN, working to automatically mask your internet traffic from both Apple, your ISP, and anyone else trying to snoop around what you’re doing online. The feature is still in beta but is currently available to anyone subscribing to a paid iCloud plan — although Apple doesn’t keep it toggled on by default, at least for now. There are other limitations, too: Private Relay won’t let you spoof your internet as coming from outside your rough geographic area (a popular use for VPNs to get around national or regional content limits), and it only works in Apple’s own Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apm9t5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw21bUEW8l0kQjcVdBZ7XBEnmGI=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376898/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives you feedback about what letters you’ve put in the right place, what letters are in the word, but not in the order you’ve picked and what letters aren’t in the correct answer. Certain parts of Twitter have been taken over by black, green, and yellow square emojis, which players use to show off their gameplay without spoiling the word of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="io8n5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As with many good viral ideas, Wordle has spawned waves of parodies and memes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgm5Z"&gt;As happens to most good ideas (especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;the ones that go viral&lt;/a&gt;), there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/11/22877996/wordle-spoofs-alternatives-letterle-sweardle-queerdle"&gt;several clever parodies of Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fobwashed/status/1480975713620541440"&gt;waves of jokes&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter using the emoji block format that players use to share their scores. But while many of the parody versions point users back to the original, this doesn’t seem to be the case for the versions on the App Store. Instead, they try their best to look like the web version without mentioning that they’re actually a spin-off. Trying out five versions of the game from the App Store, only one seemed to acknowledge Wardle’s version — ironically, it was one of the few that didn’t actually call itself Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOchjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10973311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="7978Mo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;The weird world of 'Flappy Bird' clones&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wtMf3"&gt;The situation is a little embarrassing for Apple, which has often cited its high standards and App Review process as a reason it should be allowed to keep control over which apps run on iPhones and iPads. The review process has been called into question by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt;, but these feel especially blatant — they’re using the same name and have an extremely similar interface to the original. It’s easy to see many people being tricked into thinking that they’re playing an official version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEfdJN"&gt;Even worse is that the apps are copying a website, months after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417725/apple-vs-epic-full-trial-slideshows-opening-arguments"&gt;championed&lt;/a&gt; progressive web apps in court as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;an option for developers during its legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. That argument may fall flat with developers targeting mobile audiences. As Owen Williams, a UX manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?s=20"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, they won’t even get a seat at the table when someone searches for their creation on the App Store (which is something a lot of people might do if they, say, see a flurry of tweets with the name of a Cool New Thing everyone’s playing with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyno2K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple and Google were *actually* allowing proper competition, you’d be able to register a PWA/web app in their stores if you choose that route instead of a native app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But uh, that doesn’t help build their walled gardens so we get…this&lt;/p&gt;— Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqJ57J"&gt;To add insult to injury, it appears that Wordle clones aren’t nearly as rampant on Google’s Play Store. Only one of the first two dozen search results for “wordle” appeared to be a clone, and it was buried deep behind a “show more” button. Google Play reports the app has “500+ downloads” — the developer behind one of the Wordle clones on iOS claimed to be getting 5,400 downloads an hour on Twitter, and their version wasn’t even in the top three search results. (The same developer tweeted a screenshot of a notification saying that their app was waiting for review, with the caption “let’s see what Apple thinks” prior to the app going live.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LibNuw"&gt;Wardle hasn’t monetized his version of Wordle with ads, subscriptions, one-time payments, or a tip jar. It’s totally free. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;a profile in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he made the game for his partner, who enjoyed crossword puzzles. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said of Wordle’s success. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3yUEzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to the fucking moon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkZLp8"&gt;The Wordle apps I tried haven’t copied the original’s lack of a monetization scheme. Some showed a plethora of ads, often with the option of paying to remove them, and one even had a $30-a-year in-app purchase to unlock the “Pro” version. (That particular app’s developer said on their now-private Twitter account that the app was “going to the fucking moon” and that one of their goals for 2022 was to “make tons of fucking money.”) Paying would let you choose how many letters you wanted in the words and would allow multiple games a day. As &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/wordle-game-online-free-explained.html"&gt;many have noted&lt;/a&gt;, the real Wordle’s once-a-day play is another one of the things that makes it so appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ugXCOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Added a share button to Wordle that generates a spoiler-free emoji grid for you. Shoutout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/irihapeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@irihapeta&lt;/a&gt; for inventing such a cool way to share your results each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛&lt;br&gt; ⬛  ⬛&lt;br&gt;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wordle 180 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E"&gt;https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1471493886031773707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMB2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle’s developer explaining the game’s share function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3SU7O"&gt;Most of the apps I tried didn’t have any obvious copies of the original’s share feature, which lets you easily copy a series of spoiler-free blocks to share with friends or on social media. The one that offered the $30 subscription, however, did — adding a few extra words and saying “The Wordle App” in place of Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqv7X7"&gt;Keeping blatant copies off the App Store might not be an easy moderation task if Apple wanted to do it — for example, there are a few games on the App Store that share the “Wordle” name but not gameplay. However, they’re pretty obviously not trying to capitalize on a trend by copying a popular app — many of them haven’t been updated in years (and are therefore not likely requiring any judgment calls from App Review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VdUXQ"&gt;It appears that Apple has decided to try, though. Roughly an hour after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481063416630583300"&gt;we heard&lt;/a&gt; that the clones had started disappearing from the App Store. All the ones we saw that used the word “Wordle” in their title are now gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdiT6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to both Apple and one of the developers behind a Wordle clone. Neither responded to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw18VC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Wordle clones are now disappearing from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFSC2h-JZ0-lcBTLwMcFwudM67E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/LG_A1_OLED_Lifestyle_Press_Image.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 48-inch configuration of the LG A1 OLED is now available for just shy of $800 at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGZoGb"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022 having just wrapped&lt;/a&gt;, the future looks bright if you’re looking to nab a great TV deal. At CES, many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s new C2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. That means we’re probably going to start seeing prices fall on last-gen models as newer models become available throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJ1Fo"&gt;For those looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, however, fret not, as retailers will also likely be discounting TVs in the run up to the Super Bowl next month. And if you need one now, there are currently a lot of discounted 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance for those who can’t wait. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E3xT2B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBNYtv"&gt;Select a category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;The best deals for 4K TVs for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1I1ma7"&gt;
&lt;div id="VMiVmn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10971155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="etpdeM"&gt;Sony X80J&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cart-6484511"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $649.99. In addition to free delivery, the retailer is also offering six months of Peacock Premium, $50 off a Google Nest Hub smart display with each purchase, and up to $200 off select soundbars. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X80J-Inch-Compatibility-KD50X80J/dp/B08QXFT4M9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1617352-REG%2Fsony_kd55x80j_x80j_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo are also selling the same TV&lt;/a&gt; for roughly the same price but without the added incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGFJFJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony announces the world’s first QD-OLED 4K TV, coming later this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="JbaBai"&gt;TCL 6-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W4zBa6"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885F5GMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $699.50 and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggC5UJW2ka" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $699.99 ($250 off), though, we’ve seen the R635 drop to as low as $650 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Best Buy is also offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while selling the 75-inch for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99&lt;/a&gt; ($500 off). Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV, if you purchase the two together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung The Frame TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HtcmiY"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAIL8Z"&gt;We saw the 55-inch drop from $1,499.99 to $998, its best price ever, during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, it’s now only about $100 off, with the 55-inch model going for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620610-REG%2Fsamsung_qn55ls03aafxza_the_frame_ls03a_55.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,397.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="UmMHNt"&gt;Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $369.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $549.99 price tag. Best Buy will also take $90 off of Facebook Portal TV and offer 30 days of free FuboTV Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the same discount on the TV&lt;/a&gt;, too, though it’s shipped and sold by Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cW4VPC"&gt;Toshiba Smart Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="by223n"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 55-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $519.99. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoh5l0KZNF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can pick up the 55-inch model for $469.99, a modest $50 discount. Best Buy is also throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV with each purchase (Amazon is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67O1o8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL Class 4-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="irmzdA"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for $379.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoilIi4bwL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $220 less than the usual retail price. Other sizes are on sale, too, like the 43-inch model, which &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoioZ12jhm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1603431-REG%2Ftcl_43s435_43_4k_led_roku.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; have for $279.99 instead of $349.99, about $8 shy of the TV’s best price to date. Best Buy also offers new subscribers 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus with each purchase, along with a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="gGh4Mn"&gt;Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, only just launched a few months ago and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7/10 in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nj1DzI"&gt;Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $419.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $559.99, which is just $10 more than the discount we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Both the larger and smaller configurations are on sale as well, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch going for $599.99 instead of $829.99, nearly matching its lowest price to date.&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFNuZaIWh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering comparable sales&lt;/a&gt; on various sizes, while throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV if you purchase the two together. Note, however, only the larger 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="robl5C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="X4U9P7"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget-friendly TV with good picture quality, Vizio’s midrange M7 Series Quantum TV is worthy of consideration, even if it is over $500. The 2021 model sports a 60Hz panel, along with support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, AMD FreeSync, and a variable refresh rate (VRR). It also touts Vizio’s SmartCast system and a built-in Chromecast, allowing you to cast content from your phone and access Netflix, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming services. Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy are offering discounts on various size configurations. You can buy the 55-inch, for example, for around $579 ($170 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggJ132Z3aW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MJRG2V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MNFP4D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $10 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV, and many were heavily discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you missed out on those sales, however, you may still have another shot at landing a good deal, as many of the best models are still currently available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dlhOGg"&gt;LG A1 OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;Right now, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Amazon are discounting various sizes of the LG’s entry-level A1 OLED, starting at just around &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$796.99&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon — its lowest price ever — instead of $1,199.99 for the 48-inch. Meanwhile, the $1,299.99 55-inch is selling for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632395-REG%2Flg_oled55a1pua_a1pu_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,196.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFTcfLZsN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off) at Best Buy, $100 shy of its best price to date. Best Buy is also offering up to $200 off on select soundbars, a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV, and 30 days of FuboTV Pro at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9yade"&gt;The 4K A1 offers support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as an automatic low-latency mode. Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, it doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cKOBk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QVK3a0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG announces its largest and smallest OLED TVs ever as part of 2022 lineup","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="EC2RcQ"&gt;LG GX Series OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4XqEcE"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-Series cards or next-gen consoles. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for as low as $1,529.99&lt;/a&gt; ($270 off) at Best Buy in some areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVsMDE"&gt;Normally $1,299.99, Vizio’s 55-inch OLED was recently selling for around $999 – its lowest price ever – but is currently only &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestTVdeals11022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-OLED-55-Class-4K-HDR-SmartCast-Smart-TV-OLED55-H1%2F664326832&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $1,085.39 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeBestTVDeals11022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Felectronics%2Ftvs-monitors%2Ftelevisions%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-55-in-class-oled-4k-hdr-smart-tv-oled55-h1%2F328244.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAz--OBhBIEiwAG1rIOkxcXYlj6ScGOoFBZgjK6aTkIKD4FzPqFF_iAJuMpBNs7HSsc9KnXRoC48gQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgooPl8Oqdb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the TV is one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for an OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKhcwu"&gt;Like with other models, Best Buy is also offering a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV with each purchase, in addition to three months of Tidal Premium, HiFi, or Family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L4HPUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ubtWst"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gdxA6x"&gt;LG C1 OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qapHVJ"&gt;If you’re looking for an impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0d4lq"&gt;Throughout the holidays, we saw the 55-inch C1 selling for $1,296.99 instead of $1,499.99, its lowest price to date. Sadly, that deal is no longer available. However, there are still some discounts on other configurations. You can, for instance, pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for $1,196.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632394-REG%2Flg_oled48c1pub_c1pu_48_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as $1,199.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoo6VAtupu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, instead of $1,299.99. The 65-inch, meanwhile, is also selling for $1,896.99 instead of $2,099.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632399-REG%2Flg_oled65c1pub_c1pu_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoknLTWvNN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has it for $1,899.99, but is throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV as well as 30 days of FuboTV Pro regardless of the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YU7ceV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bn523S"&gt;Samsung Neo QLED QN90A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PXnRvH"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative, there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for as low as $1,299.99.
