    <title>Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G is great at gaming, but not much else</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Singularly focused but cool under pressure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KBDSr3"&gt;Gigabyte’s refreshed Aorus 15G for 2021 has a subtle, all-black design that takes a page from the company’s more svelte Aero lineup of creator-focused laptops. It’s a nice upgrade, but there aren’t many other changes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21201164/gigabyte-aorus-gaming-aero-creator-laptop-intel-10th-gen-core-i9-i7-processor-oled"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, for better or worse. It offers the same wide variety of ports (including the all-too-rare full-size SD card reader), and impressively, Gigabyte fit an excellent 15.6-inch display into a 14-inch wide chassis. But at the same time, the keyboard is cramped and the nostril webcam is awkward to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXCE9b"&gt;There are some other swings and misses, but it nails what it’s really focused on: gaming. The bump up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip inside is the biggest change, and it helps this thin-and-light gaming laptop run most games beyond 60 frames per second, crossing the bar for reliably smooth gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTDPuq"&gt;That kind of performance is great — and not necessarily a given just because a laptop has this graphics chip. Manufacturers can set its power level to balance performance and efficiency as they see fit. So, despite having a compact chassis, I was surprised to see it perform better with games than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus TUF Dash F15&lt;/a&gt;. It’s generally much quieter, too. Gigabyte found the sweet spot, and if you plug in an external mouse and keyboard, this machine is a blast to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7qzsva"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10359594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RYXX41"&gt;The $1,799 configuration Gigabyte provided for review has the aforementioned Nvidia GPU, Intel’s 10th Gen Core i7-10870H with eight cores, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, a 99Wh battery, and its 15.6-inch 1080p display with a 240Hz refresh rate is Pantone-certified for color accuracy with 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color gamut. This isn’t Gigabyte’s top-of-the-line model, but it’s close. The step-up config for $200 more has the RTX 3080 and double the storage. A more affordable $1,499 model with the RTX 3060 is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="bDeNs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10359583"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c18vkG"&gt;Even though, technically, a laptop with the RTX 3070 is middle of the road between Nvidia’s low- and high-end graphics chips, it can deliver fantastic results. Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G would probably like to credit its gimmicky built-in Microsoft Azure application that automatically optimizes performance with AI, but it’s capable out of the box with default settings. There wasn’t a huge difference in gameplay with or without the Azure app running, nor when I set the GPU and CPU to boost in Gigabyte’s pre-installed Aorus Control Center app. That’s fine by me; the less tweaking required, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdzX2W"&gt;Getting right into game performance, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s built-in benchmark running on ultra hit a steady average of 66 frames per second, dropping to just 44 frames per second at the lowest. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; running at ultra settings with medium ray-traced shadows ran at an average of 93 frames per second. Bumping up the ray tracing to ultra knocked it down to 69 frames per second, which is still a smooth experience. None of these results come close to taking full advantage of the fast-refreshing screen, but older or less demanding games should be able to hit far higher frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjFZ2piFceoetDUNjJ6_93JxNAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315766/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games and everything else look fantastic on the Pantone-certified IPS display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojqmwMeRI1Krb89AitmdiLXgp5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315768/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having the webcam placed below the screen feels like a prank every time I use it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="faJZBB"&gt;Outside of benchmarks, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; running at ultra ray tracing settings was easily my highlight testing the Aorus 15G. This machine had little issue keeping the game running above 50 frames per second in a more barren or enclosed environment, and it rarely dropped below 40 frames per second in crowded outdoor environments — again, that’s with the most demanding graphical settings cranked up (ultra with every ray tracing setting and DLSS on). The performance here will make a lot of people happy. I was also impressed by Gigabyte’s cooling system, which keeps things surprisingly quiet and cool under pressure. This is the rare gaming laptop you can actually keep safely on your lap while gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtnSxMZDOHagrbE1UpLKlS0ZTx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315761/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The numpad is nice to have, but this is one cramped keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gc6Sw0"&gt;I’m fascinated with Nvidia’s new RTX 30-series graphics chips. Not just because they’re good, but because they sometimes provide wildly different results depending on the laptop they’re in. For instance, in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, its RTX 3080 delivers very similar performance to the chip inside of Gigabyte’s laptop here, even though it should blow it away. The reason is because this chip has a higher clock speed and power draw than what’s inside of MSI’s laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMcsfR"&gt;Specifically, this 3070 tops out at a 105W power draw with 1,290MHz clock speed, whereas the 3080 in question is at 95W maximum power and 1,245MHz clock speed. In short, you’re getting a lot of power in this thin $1,799 machine. Paying $200 more for the Aorus 15G with the RTX 3080 might not get you &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;that many more frames per second, as it also has a 105W maximum power draw but a slightly slower 1,245MHz clock speed. You might know all of this info, but you might not. Nvidia requires manufacturers to share it, though some of them are still being cagey about it. For the record, Gigabyte is one of the more transparent companies about its GPU specs. I’m &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;keeping tabs on other manufacturers right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNzHZ0T4bT-UkvmG2N0UgZqp15Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315767/cfaulkner_210216_4410_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bezels are thin, measuring at 3mm thick per side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bxISGk"&gt;Outside of gaming, the Aorus 15G is unfortunately a less convincing product. It’s able to run my usual workload flawlessly, consisting of Affinity Photo, about 10 Google Chrome apps, Slack, and Spotify. Given the specs inside, I expected this. What came as more of a surprise is that they don’t translate so well to video production. During an Adobe Premiere Pro test that exported a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, it took about seven minutes each time to render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wkQp1O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10359586"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jq8kfk"&gt;There are several other trade-offs that might give you pause if you need a laptop as much for productivity as you do for gaming. The typing experience is fine but not helped by the cramped keyboard layout. It has a tiny trackpad, and its nostril-gazing webcam didn’t cut it for me. Also, Gigabyte claims up to eight hours of battery life, but I averaged around six hours per charge. The new Asus TUF Dash F15 excels at all things Gigabyte didn’t quite land and costs less, but its lack of a webcam is a huge red flag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wqX2EL"&gt;This is a fantastic machine if all you want to do is get 60 frames per second (and often, better than that) in most of your games without tweaking many settings. Doing that for under $2,000 is an achievement worthy of praise. But if you care less about mobility and having a thin form factor that Gigabyte’s Aorus 15G provides, MSI’s GP66 Leopard takes the RTX 3070 even further. Its thicker, heavier chassis affords the chip even more headroom to get better performance in games — for the same $1,799 price, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tubi inks anime streaming deal with One Piece studio Toei Animation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdJ5QokJon2Jq95mbp354-V_uYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869207/acastro_210224_1777_toei_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4o0etp"&gt;Tubi, the free streaming service run by Fox Entertainment, has struck a deal with Toei Animation to bring some of the studio’s work to the platform. The deal includes six &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; TV specials that will come to the streaming service as well as episodes from anime shows including &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slam Dunk&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dr. Slump&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrkLkA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Slump &lt;/em&gt;is an anime adaptation of a manga done by Akira Toriyama, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; (which the show sometimes crosses over with). According to the press release, the version on Tubi will be the first time the show has been available to stream in the US with English subtitles. Looking up the show online shows how hard it’s been to access, with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/comments/3txdvf/what_is_the_best_way_to_watch_drslump/"&gt;fans talking about a not-well-done DVD release&lt;/a&gt;. Having it available to stream, especially for free, should make it easier for hardcore &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball &lt;/em&gt;fans to get a taste of some of its creator’s earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIcda4"&gt;The full list of content in the deal includes episodes from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OrXB4d"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gx6af9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Seiya: Saintia Sho &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eMp0so"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Seiya: Hades &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HBDRa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ge-Ge-Ge No Kitaro &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qfAv9c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slam Dunk &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wd34Td"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Sump &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ua3Ck5"&gt;As well as the six &lt;em&gt;One Piece &lt;/em&gt;TV specials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xdly9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D2Y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7LiqgP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Episode of Sabo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YjQKRb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure of Nebulandia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qO93l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart of Gold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F9a00G"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Episode of East Blue&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Nvr0y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Episode of Skypiea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QufEzZ"&gt;If you’ve been meaning to watch anything from the list, keep an eye on Tubi. The shows should be available soon for free — but as always, they’ll come with ads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD is announcing a new Radeon RX 6000 GPU in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oa5FYyQp0pC0uQY7ozWTftQwAJY=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869189/twarren_201116_4300_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AMD’s Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgdgGi"&gt;AMD has announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1364636388453470210?s=20"&gt;a new hardware event for next month&lt;/a&gt;, where the company plans to unveil the next GPU in its Radeon RX 6000 line of cards. The presentation will air on March 3rd at 8AM PT / 11AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GuR8A"&gt;Like other GPUs in the RX 6000 series, this new model will use the RDNA 2 architecture, including real-time, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading. AMD’s announcement of a new GPU presentation comes just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;one day before sales kick off for Nvidia’s affordable RTX 3060 GPU&lt;/a&gt; at select retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DgkUCf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 3rd, the journey continues for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDNA2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RDNA2&lt;/a&gt;. Join us at 11AM US Eastern as we reveal the latest addition to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AMD&lt;/a&gt; Radeon RX 6000 graphics family. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5CFvT9D2SR"&gt;https://t.co/5CFvT9D2SR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tUpUwRfpgk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tUpUwRfpgk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Radeon RX (@Radeon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1364636388453470210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DF7cxi"&gt;AMD debuted the Radeon RX 6000 line of graphics cards in late October, with the GPUs serving as a direct competitor to Nvidia’s RTX 30 cards. Currently, the RX 6000 consists of three GPUs: the flagship RX 6900 XT, the $649 RX 6800 XT, and the RX 6800, which is the most affordable of the trio at $579.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLNpbG"&gt;With the announcement of a new RX 6000 card coming, we anticipate that, like other GPUs in this series, it will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;AMD  told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that within the first quarter of 2021, it expects to sell more of its own RX 6000 cards through its website, which is bittersweet news considering the RX 6000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;has been difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Solo Pro noise-canceling headphones are available for the lowest price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxpZrwF-fqrhnu8QyA7HGgEPM3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68869066/cwelch_191001_3705_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2CdM4i"&gt;Woot is offering the best sale price we’ve seen yet on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price"&gt;Beats Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones. Normally $300, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeBeatsSoloProNoiseCancellingSale02242021/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/beats-solo-pro-noise-cancelling-headphones-new-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;light blue and dark blue color options are $150 new&lt;/a&gt;. These headphones come with a one-year manufacturer warranty directly through Apple. The lowest price we’ve seen previously is around the $170 mark, depending on the color you’re interested in. The Solo Pro headphones are compatible with Android and iOS, but they shine brighter on iPhone, since they have the H1 wireless chip and “Hey Siri” hands-free controls. The downside for Android owners used to USB-C is that they recharge through a Lightning connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htpcsh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ah3iA"&gt;If you’re looking to cover all of your audio needs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279609/ultimate-ears-hyperboom-party-bluetooth-speaker-review"&gt;Ultimate Ears’ huge Hyperboom&lt;/a&gt; Bluetooth speaker is $59 off at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8B9NV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $341&lt;/a&gt;. I reviewed it last summer, and it was a joy to be able to blast music loudly, indoors or outdoors, rain or shine. It’s big, like a bit bigger than the Xbox Series X that it’s similar is shape to, and it’s heavy, too. In addition to being able to play music from multiple Bluetooth sources at once, you can charge a phone from it and even use it as a stand-in home theater speaker with its digital optical audio port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXyKJb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10359731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prcnlV"&gt;February 24th is &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; day, celebrating the day that FBI agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) ventured into the fictional town of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; in the Pacific Northwest for the first time. I was hoping to be overwhelmed with deals on various Blu-ray collections, but there aren’t many.

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, and the HP Chromebook x360. Samsung is soon releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;; we’re excited to publish a full review of that shortly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjxyUU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZOrDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;7. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA cancels Anthem’s big revamp but will keep the game running</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfuqheielTGuGP002x34jFA4nhw=/106x0:1240x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868897/anthem.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BioWare&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsTUnC"&gt;After putting a pin in short-term updates and expansions to focus on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131662/bioware-anthem-longer-term-redesign-updates-paused-game-relaunch"&gt;“longer-term redesign”&lt;/a&gt; of the game, EA announced today that it will be &lt;a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/"&gt;canceling its planned revamp&lt;/a&gt; of the game &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Anthem Next&lt;/em&gt;. But the company plans to keep &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;’s live service running “as it exists today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL2u4j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;In the spirit of transparency and closure we wanted to share that we’ve made the difficult decision to stop our new development work on &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; (aka &lt;em&gt;Anthem NEXT&lt;/em&gt;),” BioWare executive producer Christian Dailey said in a recent blog post. “We will, however, continue to keep the Anthem live service running as it exists today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76O9jn"&gt;BioWare does have other projects in the works, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167450/dragon-age-4-bioware-trailer-ea-game-awards-reveal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1364654789443862528?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, the small team that was working on &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;’s redesign will now be working on the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1SKez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update on Anthem from Christian Dailey: &lt;a href="https://t.co/twmWXAXj3B"&gt;https://t.co/twmWXAXj3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BioWare (@bioware) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bioware/status/1364655332501450760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rtOPqR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; launched nearly two years ago and was met with poor reviews, with the main criticism stemming from a lack of content, subpar story, and repetitive gameplay. A year following its release, BioWare said it was invested in improving the game with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18194445/bioware-anthem-storytelling-interview-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;seasonal updates&lt;/a&gt;. But last year, then-general manager Casey Hudson said that it would pause short-term updates to reinvent the entire game. It was reported last May that &lt;a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2020/05/15/may-anthem-update/"&gt;an incubation team of about 30 people&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with reworking &lt;em&gt;Anthem. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85KsaH"&gt;With support for &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; ending, BioWare’s open-world shooter will not receive a second chance. It's quite common for games to struggle at launch, but several have turned things around thanks to frequent updates, which was the case for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Left out of boil water orders, some Texans may need to test wells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A technician repairs a sink with brown tap water" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psM4P5K9OKkrVilwPu6EWmZr3zA=/0x3:6016x4014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868861/1231351769.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An unprecedented winter storm swept across Texas and left many of its residents without power and water for multiple days in Houston, Texas in February, 2021. Many residents are still unable to drink their water until a plumber can address the cracks in their pipes, which were caused by freezing temperatures. | Photo by Callaghan OHare for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQIz2l"&gt;Unlike millions of Texans who received boil water notices from utility companies, families who rely on private wells have been left to figure out for themselves whether their water is safe to drink in the wake of last week’s deep freeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uDU9D5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no warning put out there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktv1Z2"&gt;“There’s no warning put out there in the press for what these homeowners who have their own water supply, what they should be doing in these scenarios to protect themselves and their family,” says Jackie Young-Medcalf, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Health and Environment Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO8HzW"&gt;Bacteria and contaminants can find their way into cracks in pipes that burst after freezing. As a result, millions of people on public water systems were told by utilities to boil their tap water after frigid temperatures wreaked havoc on Texas’ infrastructure last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCugD6"&gt;But more than 1.3 million Texans aren’t connected to public water utilities, and instead depend on their own wells for their drinking water, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://tgpc.texas.gov/water-wells/#2"&gt;Groundwater Protection Committee&lt;/a&gt;. Even those official numbers can easily underestimate how many wells there really are and who relies on them, according to Young-Medcalf, because people don’t always register wells that they dig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidLxC"&gt;Wells that might have been most at risk recently in Texas are older wells with shallow piping. These would have been more exposed to the cold than deeper wells and probably don’t have as much protective casing. Within a private water system, pipes are most likely to have sustained damage, compared to other pieces of equipment, experts say. Any pipes that ruptured above ground should be repaired but aren’t as likely to let in contaminants. Breaks that happen underground are less likely but potentially more dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5fUwH"&gt;“If you’ve had pipes that are broken and they’re in the ground — or worse, were flooded or underwater — then you’d want to repair that and test your water first before you drink it,” says Steven Wilson, a groundwater hydrologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He developed a free &lt;a href="http://privatewellclass.org/"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; on well maintenance that’s available online. Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s &lt;a href="https://twon.tamu.edu/"&gt;Texas Well Owners Network&lt;/a&gt; offers similar resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QrblAk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Their water is varying shades of yellow and brown.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7xnFwt"&gt;Young-Medcalf is especially concerned about people who rely on well water and live in places where there’s a history of toxins polluting soil and groundwater. She says she’s heard from several people this week who are concerned about their well water and live &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/EPA-wells-dry-cleaning-Superfund-sites-15027503.php"&gt;near a Superfund site&lt;/a&gt; called the Jones Road Groundwater Plume just outside Houston. Superfund sites are places that have been so polluted that the federal government placed it on a “National Priorities List” for cleanup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzXQH1"&gt;“Folks have been reporting to [us] that their water has particles in it and that their water is varying shades of yellow and brown,” says Young-Medcalf. “When multiple groundwater well owners are reporting these observations in their water you have to think, ‘What’s in the environment that made their way into their water system?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzMVQA"&gt;How your water looks and smells isn’t necessarily the best indicator of whether it’s safe to drink. Naturally occurring tannins and silica in groundwater can give it a slight color, even if it is safe. On the other hand, some dangerous contaminants are colorless, tasteless, and odorless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zey7Rh"&gt;“Now if your water’s always been perfectly clear and all of a sudden it has a color, then you probably want to get it tested, but it doesn’t mean you should panic,” says Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJOgnO"&gt;Luckily, last week’s snowfall and resulting runoff after it melted weren’t likely to cause as much damage to local Superfund sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385568/hurricane-harvey-superfund-site-houston-dioxin-cancer-chemicals"&gt;as Hurricane Harvey did in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Young-Medcalf says. But she’s still concerned about toxins that already surrounded existing groundwater wells and just needed a break to find their way into people’s home water systems — especially near Jones Road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U48s9J"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is assessing Superfund sites that might have been affected by severe weather last week to make sure they aren’t a danger to anyone. Of 16 assessed so far (there are &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/tx/cleanups-texas#sites"&gt;68 in Texas&lt;/a&gt;), “None of these sites report any offsite release or impacts to water systems,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email on February 22nd. The EPA hasn’t responded to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s query about the Jones Road site specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wtsdGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Test annually to give you that confidence that your well is still performing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzV0lu"&gt;The best way for any well owner to keep their drinking water safe is to learn more about their well and test it annually, regardless of whether there’s been severe weather or their proximity to a polluted area. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has a list of &lt;a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/compliance/compliance_support/qa/txnelap_lab_list.pdf"&gt;accredited laboratories&lt;/a&gt; that provide well testing. The commission also has resources to help households find &lt;a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/drinkingwater/SWAP/wells.html"&gt;well reports&lt;/a&gt; for their property. A well report or “&lt;a href="http://privatewellclass.org/blog/PostId/1228/faq-well-logs"&gt;well log&lt;/a&gt;” can give an owner more information about the well, like how deep it is, how and when it was built, and what materials surround it — all information that might be able to point to any vulnerabilities a well has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta8zSR"&gt;“There’s a list of things that can cause a well not to be properly sealed anymore,” Wilson says. “So it’s good to just test annually to give you that confidence that your well is still performing the way it’s supposed to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft reinvents calling a cab </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKri5g4iz-PAQokT2A9CH3WIbE4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868578/acastro_180927_1777_lyft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIQHbL"&gt;Lyft is admitting that some part of traditional taxi services are worth emulating today by letting people in select Florida cities &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;book Lyft rides with just a phone call&lt;/a&gt;. The new “Call A Lyft” feature should be “perfect for seniors and folks without access to the Lyft app,” says Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZXHjI"&gt;Calling 631-201-LYFT (631-201-5938) between 8AM-8PM ET on Monday through Friday will let a potential rider book a ride. Lyft says that it will tell riders the full price before confirming and send texts to track the ride once it’s paid for and booked. It should be familiar to anyone who’s ever called a cab, though Lyft notes drivers are not expected to offer assistance getting into a car and wheelchair accessible rides aren’t available at launch. Call A Lyft also requires a phone with support for SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkIEzj"&gt;Lyft isn’t the only ride-sharing company to fall back on phone calls. Uber experimented with a similar feature in 2020, allowing customers in Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;to dial 1-833-USE-UBER&lt;/a&gt; to book a ride. Prior to both companies falling back on taxi service tactics, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;GoGoGrandparent&lt;/a&gt; stepped in as an intermediary for ride-sharing and food delivery companies, allowing older folks to dial a phone number and have someone else handle the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UILBwV"&gt;Lyft and Uber pushed out traditional taxi and cab services with a theoretically easy-to-use service and a large pool of drivers, but Call A Lyft illustrates that sometimes the old methods were that way for a reason — because they worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNHwrM"&gt;Call A Lyft is available now and Lyft has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full list of supported cities&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pX5Z1L"&gt;Health care company One Medical gave COVID-19 vaccines to people who were ineligible under local guidelines, including friends and family of company leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Health departments in Washington state and California said they stopped distributing doses to One Medical after finding out that the company was not sticking to eligibility rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXaE4p"&gt;The company was given vaccine doses in a few states, including Washington and California. Internal messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; show that doctors raised concerns about patients jumping the line for vaccinations ahead of people who where higher priority for the shots. Now, Alameda County, California and the Washington State Department of Health have refused to give the company more doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs3Ucf"&gt;In many states, people who are older or who have underlying health conditions can get vaccinated now; younger, healthy people still have to wait. One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible, staffers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ae4nH1"&gt;&lt;q&gt; One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ozTE2B"&gt;“Why are young patients without health problems, on a trial membership ... allowed to book and receive a covid vaccine while healthcare workers are being waitlisted?” one medical professional asked in January in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;messages obtained&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnEBz"&gt;One Medical, which was backed by &lt;a href="https://www.gv.com/portfolio/"&gt;Alphabet’s GV&lt;/a&gt;, offers primary care to members in around a dozen cities across the United States for a $199 annual fee. The company went public in January 2020; as of today, its market capitalization is $7 billion. The company told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that it doesn’t knowingly let people skip the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD6BNw"&gt;The company’s vaccine scheduling system did not ask people to confirm if they were eligible under local guidelines until January 14th, two weeks after One Medical started offering vaccines. Once it &lt;em&gt;did ask&lt;/em&gt;, people who said they were not eligible could still book appointments. Blocking people from signing up would be too technologically difficult, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aqri2"&gt;“Scanning schedules and cancelling appointments [for ineligible patients] is not recommended,” said Spencer Blackman, the director of clinical education at the company, in a message to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Andrew Diamond, chief medical officer of One Medical, initially denied to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that staff were directed not to verify eligibility. Later, he said One Medical has communicated more clearly since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorbb0"&gt;After receiving complaints, the Washington State Department of Health stopped distributing COVID-19 vaccines to One Medical. Los Angeles County’s Department of Public Health warned One Medical that it would stop giving the company doses if it did not confirm patients’ vaccine eligibility. Alameda County, California said it did not give additional doses to One Medical after the company said it wanted to vaccinate people who were ineligible. &lt;/p&gt;
