    <title>Twitter Communities now work on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etAeUP-_caPc9foT6JqNCspNXsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411369/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYLPuE"&gt;Twitter is rolling out its Communities feature, a rival to Facebook Groups and Reddit, to Android users worldwide. Since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;launch in September&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter Communities has been limited to iOS or the web, meaning Android users could only join and participate in communities through a browser and not the native Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFQbo5"&gt;Android users can now easily join, request to join, or participate in Twitter Communities, opening up the feature to a lot more of Twitter’s userbase. Twitter Communities work like a private group, or like a subreddit. Twitter users can choose to tweet directly to a Twitter community, and that tweet won’t show up on their own feed or to their followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aHzh8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitters Communities is still in beta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMMGDF"&gt;Twitter Communities is still an invite-only feature for those wanting to create their own private community. Group owners can choose whether people need an invite to join a community or whether they’re open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVGrQ0"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out the Twitter Communities feature, Twitter is highlighting the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1456210950697201667&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=Rqoogv5hj3GkJ0cEq4S-U7uav8wkd2DfRMfphOhuCWM&amp;amp;e="&gt;Roblox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1455305732912418820&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=M83vv79CLhSEGG9_7g2pqkisivtxcOA8SL5qJ7Eu-4w&amp;amp;e="&gt;Xbox Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1472105760389668865&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=jmUmmI7YfVP9GDEWDLpyEBJaDu9_nnKcTufoC1rpqu0&amp;amp;e="&gt;Tech Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1455315897657270281&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=v1wORJFKp8-gYXri4ARRZvCCwBA8A3THdu_mWBM3wEU&amp;amp;e="&gt;Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1473375845628710916&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=H3u0iKCcwnEfiZMlk3AEJP6xVXAf2mpIQxfBBKWSjaQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;R&amp;amp;B Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1442988929070731268&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=0j4xDJNevlBE8Iq9ZEUAvintdRD7523SQWEq0G8hcps&amp;amp;e="&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; communities that are all public for anyone to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6TKnx"&gt;Twitter is also exploring a “request to join” option for communities, so groups can more closely monitor who joins a community. Alongside this new option, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1478795193050701825"&gt;Twitter is also planning&lt;/a&gt; to test a ranked timeline that will show top tweets from a community, ways for mods to highlight content in community, and methods for Q&amp;amp;As to be held with mods or members.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s first clothing store lets you summon clothes to the fitting room  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A touchscreen in Amazon Style’s fitting room." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEWbc6GviwcZTzgk8Kr84T1Ozz0=/51x0:609x372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411286/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JBpEmM"&gt;Amazon Style is a new kind of physical store from the online shopping giant that will focus on clothing, footwear, and other fashion accessories, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-reimagines-in-store-shopping-with-amazon-style"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s due to open at The Americana at Brand shopping mall in Los Angeles later this year, where it will be Amazon’s “first-ever physical apparel store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YT49E"&gt;In line with Amazon’s existing retail locations, the new Amazon Style store is packed to the gills with shopping tech. Amazon says clothes racks will feature QR codes, which customers can scan to see available sizes, colors, customer ratings, and product details. Then, with a tap of a button, selected items will be sent to a fitting room to try on without having to first rummage through racks. Amazon will also send additional items its algorithms think you might like. A promotional video shows how Amazon’s app will alert customers when a fitting room is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yv_gzjgKsOSwtEwIZ9AzXpvE_cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181750/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_11.25.18_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video shows Amazon’s app alerting a customer when their fitting room is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1lId4P"&gt;The fitting rooms will also feature touchscreens of their own, so customers can request more items be brought to them. Items can either be purchased in store or saved to the Amazon Shopping app to buy at a later date. Alternatively, customers at home can use the app to find clothing they want, before having them delivered to the Amazon Style store to try on in person. The store will support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One&lt;/a&gt;, a technology that lets you pay for items by using the palm of your hand for identity verification. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A touchscreen in Amazon Style’s fitting room." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c760_Cb5E8zQA5r_2NjZ4uKIbgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181734/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitting rooms are equipped with touchscreens that can be used to request more clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rvl2Wc"&gt;Conspicuously absent is any mention of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology, which it’s previously used in its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869294/amazon-go-store-chicago-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534570/amazon-fresh-full-size-grocery-store-just-walk-out-cashierless-technology-bellevue-washington"&gt;Amazon Fresh&lt;/a&gt; stores, as well as an increasing number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784994/amazon-cashierless-technology-uk-customers-sainsburys"&gt;external stores&lt;/a&gt;, to allow customers to pick up items and walk out without needing to pay for them at a register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXseSW"&gt;Amazon says its new store is far more space-efficient, with Amazon Style able to offer “more than double the number of styles” as a traditional store of a similar size. But if it works, it also sounds like it could remove some of the pain points of in-store shopping, like having to awkwardly walk about a store half-clothed in search of a different size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FtD5k"&gt;Although it appears to rely heavily on automation, Amazon says its new Style store will still have traditional employees, who will be focused on customer service, delivering items to fitting rooms, helping customers at checkout, managing back-of-house, and processing payments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2wlmC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Task Manager design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-60_7eMujDpoL-DdFysOtrhvvY=/75x0:1455x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411262/unknown.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MaK7zh"&gt;Microsoft is getting ready to overhaul the Task Manager in Windows 11. Like the rest of the operating system, the Task Manager is getting a new design that matches Microsoft’s new Fluent Design language. It seems Microsoft hid the new design in the bowels of recent Windows 11 builds, but engineering student &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gus33000"&gt;Gustave Monce&lt;/a&gt;, who previously got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558999/microsoft-windows-11-windows-phone-port-developer-engineer"&gt;Windows 11 running on a phone&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered the work-in-progress and shared it on Discord this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s01iqn"&gt;It’s possible to enable the new Task Manager inside the latest preview builds of Windows 11, but Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the redesign. “This is a hidden feature in the new build,” says Monce. “Everything is broken though.” It’s clearly early days for this new design, but it already includes a dark mode and interface that closely matches the big design changes in Windows 11 — rounded corners, pastel shades, and a focus on simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yU42B"&gt;The tabs in the existing Task Manager have been replaced with a sidebar that allows you to switch between the various sections of the app. Task Manager is a big legacy part of Windows that originally debuted with Windows NT 4.0. It hasn’t had any significant changes for nearly 10 years after it was last overhauled in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKHBhi"&gt;Microsoft is gradually redesigning most of the legacy parts of Windows. A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785617/microsoft-windows-11-media-player-app-audio-video-features"&gt;Media Player app is currently in testing&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 is also getting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822651/microsoft-windows-11-notepad-redesign-find-replace-insider"&gt;redesigned Notepad app with dark mode support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are personally lobbying senators against antitrust legislation: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-APPLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgEeo5Gn3bN60msYwvZmF4lS3gk=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411252/1032853198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wCISDb"&gt;The United States’ biggest tech companies are seriously worried about new antitrust legislation. So much so that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have been personally “calling and meeting with senators,” urging them to oppose the mooted legislation, according to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/punchbowl-news-am-1-18-22/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites “​​multiple Senate aides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZJVRO"&gt;The legislation in question is &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The legislation is currently in its early stages, and is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The bill would need to pass votes from both the House and Senate to become law, but it’s still easy to see why it’s ruffling feathers with Silicon Valley’s biggest beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJSCyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legislation only affects the biggest US tech firms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAJ6oL"&gt;The legislation prohibits online platforms from advantaging their own “products, services, or lines of business” over those of rivals. It applies only to the biggest tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, and Alphabet’s Google (though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/u-s-antitrust-bill-expanded-to-include-tiktok-tencent-s-wechat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it will be expanded to cover Chinese tech giants TikTok and WeChat, too). These platforms would be barred from behavior like biasing search results in their favor, limiting rivals’ access to platform data, and using non-public data from customers to compete against them (activities that companies including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544921/european-commission-google-antitrust-investigation-ad-tech-advertising-services"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are accused of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjJyh"&gt;Although the exact impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, one aspect that worries Apple in particular is a possible threat to its App Store business model. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;letter sent by the company&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said that if the bill became law it would be forced to allow users to “sideload” apps onto iPhones and iPads as it does Macs — meaning installing them from sources outside the App Store. Apple says this threatens the security of its users by allowing unvetted apps onto devices, and cuts into one of its main revenue streams (Apple collects up to 30 percent commission on App Store sales). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EZF9j"&gt;In response to Apple’s arguments, a spokesperson for Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices. All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVoGXM"&gt;Although the Klobuchar-Grassley bill is roundly opposed by tech’s largest companies, smaller players have &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;come out in support of the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of 35 tech firms recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee arguing that the legislation is necessary to curb “the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYvh3v"&gt;“For too long, dominant technology companies have made it difficult for other businesses to compete in the digital marketplace by abusing their gatekeeper status to give themselves and their partners preferential treatment and access on their platforms,” said the letter’s signatories, which include DuckDuckGo, Patreon, Sonos, Wyze, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYg3I5"&gt;It’s not the first time Big Tech’s top executives have personally mobilized against antitrust legislation. Last year, when US politicians were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;considering five new antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to “deliver a warning” against the impact of “rushed” legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony expects Microsoft to ‘continue to ensure’ Activision games stay multiplatform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWf_GnVfVC0jvnD9Lhs1RkS_JmU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411203/sonylogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Knv2ut"&gt;Sony has responded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s blockbuster proposal to buy Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; with a comment on what that might mean for the future games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation consoles. “We expect that Microsoft will abide by contractual agreements and continue to ensure Activision games are multiplatform,” a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-expects-microsoft-to-keep-activision-games-multiplatform-11642665939"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izpw1z"&gt;That statement’s wording is less than definitive. It’s not surprising that Sony would expect Microsoft to honor any existing contractual agreements regarding PlayStation games, as it did when PS5 console exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was released after Microsoft’s acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of publisher Bethesda Softworks. Once existing agreements expire, it opens the door for Microsoft to pursue Xbox exclusivity for the many franchises it’s acquiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpCrQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will Call of Duty be Xbox exclusive?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5OrIO"&gt;The big question is around &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise is hugely popular across both Xbox and PlayStation, but Sony has had a&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; marketing deal in place with Activision for more than five years. “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8787135/call-of-duty-playstation-exclusive-deal-black-ops-3"&gt;PlayStation is the new home of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” declared former PlayStation CEO Andrew House during Sony’s E3 2015 press briefing. &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/11/12/playstation-5-turns-one-today/#sf251182436"&gt;Sony revealed&lt;/a&gt; in November that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;was the second most played PS5 game for the whole of 2021, behind only &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; also secured both of the top spots for US game sales for the whole of 2021, according to NPD, highlighting its impact on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EquwRS"&gt;Once Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal closes, Sony will be powerless over &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s long-term future on PlayStation. Microsoft’s Bethesda acquisition led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; becoming an Xbox and PC exclusive&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is hinting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783314/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-exclusive-pc-phil-spencer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;will also be an Xbox exclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXstjT"&gt;“Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward,” said Spencer earlier this week. It’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft maintains &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; across multiple platforms, but any future &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games go Xbox exclusive. After all, Microsoft isn’t spending $68.7 billion to keep publishing PlayStation games forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s EOS R5C is a 2-in-1 stills and cinema camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih2RQwKG-oLXLm4s2n_Z5DoRnWU=/0x0:1179x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411082/Canon_EOS_R5_C_with_BG_R10_battery_grip.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgcLTn"&gt;Canon has announced a new camera that brings cinema-grade video capabilities to a conventional full-frame mirrorless body. The EOS R5C looks a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn looked a lot like a Canon DSLR, but it’s much bulkier in the back. This is to accommodate an active cooling system so it can shoot for long stretches without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjBjmj"&gt;How long? Well, Canon says the cooling system allows the R5C to shoot up to 8K/60fps indefinitely. This was an issue with the R5; it was advertised as being able to shoot 8K for about 20 minutes, and Canon later released a firmware update to improve overheating problems. The R5C also supports 8K HDR recording in HLG and PQ formats as well as 4K/120fps recording in 4:2:2 10-bit color without cropping the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRL4mdogITyRsxlg04sKVVhYIAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181655/Canon_EOS_R5_C_Stills_Video_Switch.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F6kSdk"&gt;As a stills camera, it’s essentially identical to the R5 except for the lack of in-body image stabilization. The full-frame sensor is 45 megapixels and you can shoot at 12fps with the mechanical shutter or 20fps with the electronic shutter. The camera’s three-way power switch lets you boot it up into photo or video modes, with the menus and button functionalities changing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opDhtI"&gt;The EOS R5C will be released in March for $4,499. That’s $600 more expensive than the EOS R5, but then you’re almost getting another separate camera at the same time. For some creators and producers, the all-in-one convenience could be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku outage leads to frozen TVs and unresponsive devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCO9TkRmPGLT-UjRAOAvWXKew3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410747/DSCF3624_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKOl6u"&gt;Roku experienced a significant service disruption on Wednesday evening, which resulted in some of the company’s streaming devices and even Roku TVs getting stuck on the loading screen or going through a reboot loop and becoming effectively useless. Roku TV sets from TCL, Hisense, and other manufacturers were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2Q4h"&gt;Users took to social media and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/"&gt;Roku’s subreddit&lt;/a&gt; to report problems with their Roku hardware, and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/roku/"&gt;Down Detector showed a spike for Roku’s services&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s support account &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/Service-Interruption-Activation-and-and-service-interruption/m-p/759715#M36686"&gt;acknowledged the ongoing issues at around 8:30PM ET.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X1iJx"&gt;“Roku is aware of an issue reported by users who are unable to access some Roku services,” the company said. “If you are trying to activate your device, please try again later. Our priority is to get this resolved as soon as possible, and we ask that you bear with us as we manage this issue.” By late Wednesday night, the company’s services appeared to be operational again for those who had experienced the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3kmuZ"&gt;In a damning indictment of smart TVs, some customers had trouble using devices connected to the HDMI ports of their Roku TV, such as cable boxes or gaming consoles, during the service outage since the TVs were unable to activate after a factory reset.

    <title>You can now save $20-$36 a year on YouTube Premium and Music Premium with new annual plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dCRnid3ewQH8Gfagfp2XVQICGlU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410593/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8BTJH"&gt;If you’re a new or existing user of YouTube Premium and Music Premium, which let you watch and listen ad-free, you might be able to save up to $36 a year with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/11417260?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;oco=0"&gt;Google’s new annual plans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/18/youtube-premium-music-annual/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. From now until Sunday, January 23rd, users can receive an extra discount with the promo rate, but the new annual plans cost less than the current monthly rate either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlEdJC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium’s new annual plan&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $107.99, roughly $36 less than you’d pay for a year at its current monthly price of $143.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf2PuU"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium Music&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, the annual rate is currently $89.99, but will be priced at $119.88 after Sunday — still nearly a $30 savings over paying monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UrrVNQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"After years of false starts, YouTube is now serious about music streaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17391686/youtube-music-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JVhxao"&gt;Users are still able to sign-up for a month-to-month subscription, too — $11.99 for YouTube Premium and $9.99 for YouTube Music Premium, the same price as they were before. Both services offer a 7-day free trial period for new users before the user is charged for the full month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzCaAR"&gt;Though the annual subscription offers a one and done option for YouTube Music Premium users, it might not make sense if you’re grandfathered into an earlier, cheaper plan. You’d be paying 11 cents more for an annual plan if you’re currently paying $9.99 a month for YouTube Music, and it’s an even worse deal if you still have the old $7.99 plan, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdO524"&gt;With an annual plan, you have to pay for either service upfront, and YouTube says it won’t automatically renew at the end of one year. For existing subscribers, you may need to change your plan to qualify: It’s not available for those on family and student plans, and existing individual users on monthly subscriptions have to cancel their current plan before they can purchase the annual service. The plans are also only available in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Thailand, India and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyGfbb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT meta-review: even desperate gamers should think twice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8o9vWSs3oHgObLq32plMh6u-Fg=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410587/rx_6500_xt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nPHaQF"&gt;You’ve heard that PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;are nearly impossible to find&lt;/a&gt;, or that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;you’ll have to pay exorbitant sums&lt;/a&gt;. But if you were hoping the $200 budget AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT was about to change that, we have some very bad news. Reviewers are &lt;em&gt;positively ripping it a new one&lt;/em&gt;, and not just because of its cost, or the fact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891092/amd-4g-vram-claim-gpu-launch-rx-6500-xt"&gt;it only has 4GB of VRAM&lt;/a&gt; — but apparently because this brand-new GPU is laughably bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyanU"&gt;“[T]his is the worst GPU release since I can remember, and I’ve been doing this job for over two decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;writes &lt;em&gt;TechSpot’s&lt;/em&gt; Steven Walton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKJD8"&gt;“AMD RX 6500 XT is worse than 2016’s GPUs,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFpuJqx9Qmw&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;declares &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jLfKH"&gt;“WTF AMD!?” and “WTF is AMD thinking?,” ask &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArW4-mkGHSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Canucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmE8iZWaLWE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuruTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; respectively. “A GPU you might be able to buy... but shouldn’t,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYp6pEDm4E8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linus Tech Tips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Worst GPU,” declares &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5_oM3Ow_CI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DJ21h"&gt;“Gigabyte’s RX 6500 XT Gaming OC card gives us our first bitter taste of what a ‘budget’ GPU means in 2022,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-benchmarks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adding “as a modern graphics card it looks like pretty weak sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD05Sv"&gt;“The year 2022 just started, and this potentially looks to be the most insufficient graphics card series of the year,” concludes &lt;a href="https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/radeon_rx_6500_xt_review,28.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guru3D&lt;/em&gt;’s Hilbert Hagedoorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZihzB"&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever seen a graphics card dragged this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PI0PZI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Radeon RX 6500 XT really shows the world everything that’s wrong with the current state of the GPU market” — Tom’s Hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehccNL"&gt;Even relatively respectful outlets offer few compliments, with &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s Brad Chacos suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that AMD may be able to tap “an unserved market” if it can actually hit $199 and calling it “a capable budget option” for medium to high settings at 1080p. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; thinks&lt;/a&gt; $199 is optimistic, though. “At least buying an RX 6500 XT guarantees you’re getting a brand-new card, which can’t be said for the various used GPUs being sold on eBay and other second-hand markets,” writes Jarred Walton, damning with faint praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMexno"&gt;According to reviewers, the problem is multifaceted but fairly simple to sum up: AMD cut serious corners on a GPU while also failing to improve performance. They point out that performance is roughly equivalent to the card’s direct predecessor, the RX 5500 XT — a card that came out two years ago, &lt;em&gt;for less money, &lt;/em&gt;with more video outputs. (Here, you only only get one HDMI and one DisplayPort.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdg4I"&gt;And if you look further back, like &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt; and others did, you might notice performance hasn’t meaningfully improved over AMD’s RX 580 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060 — mid-range cards from 2017 and 2016 respectively. (The RX 580 seems to beat it in some of the benchmarks I’m seeing — if AMD sometimes loses to a five-year-old card that originally retailed for $229, that seems bad, no?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y77WxI"&gt;But it gets even worse if you’ve got an older PCIe 3.0 motherboard, some point out, because AMD reportedly decided to limit the card’s bandwidth to 4x, instead of the full 16 lanes of bandwidth, when it’s plugged into a PCIe 3.0 slot. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;Here’s TechSpot again&lt;/a&gt;, talking about testing &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; using one of those older boards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mQkgAC"&gt;The average frame rate also fell by 28% and this saw the 6500 XT go from 65 fps to just 47 fps. It also meant although it was able to match the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1961-radeon-rx-5500-4gb-vs-8gb/"&gt;5500 XT&lt;/a&gt; when using PCIe 4.0, when installed in a PCIe 3.0 system you’re looking more at base GTX 1650 performance, which is worse than the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1411-radeon-rx-570-vs-geforce-gtx-1060-3gb/"&gt;RX 570&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kGgn"&gt;Here are some other choice quotes from reviewers attempting to find a silver lining in the RX 6500 XT (power consumption seems to be a bright spot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m32jHD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tSEIwR"&gt;Of the six games with ray tracing that we tested — and admittedly, we used more demanding RT games, as otherwise the effects are largely wasted — only one qualified as even remotely playable: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. And even it wasn’t without trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZQtF4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCWorld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AUJnro"&gt;But the modest GPU and bizarre memory configuration mean you’ll need to be careful about the settings you use. If you crank visuals up to ultra or run into a game with especially high memory demands, the limited memory capacity and bus width could result in jarring frame-time spikes when your PC exceeds the 4GB barrier and needs to tap into your system’s general RAM pool for help. Don’t push this GPU harder than it’s intended for and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6RyCSK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review?page=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HotHardware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yCCv3v"&gt;The new Radeon RX 6500 XT is one of the more power-friendly GPUs of the bunch. Despite offering much better performance (more often than not) then the GeForce GTX 1650, the 6500 XT consumes only slightly more power. In comparison to the Radeon RX 5500 XT and Radeon RX 570, however, the new 6500 XT uses significantly less power when under load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1ltnQ"&gt;Maybe sit out this one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to clean your $19 Apple cleaning cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUWNdpAMJQaWMPg0BN1He4njZkE=/143x0:1859x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410545/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just throw it in the wash.&lt;/em&gt; | Image of cloth: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fkw4NC"&gt;Here’s the scenario: you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;managed to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s hottest product, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;$19 polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt; meant for cleaning nano-texture screens and other Apple devices. But oh no! Instead of hanging it up with the rest of your priceless artifacts, you accidentally used it to actually clean something, and now it’s &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully, Apple has bestowed us with a guide on how to make our cloth good as new, and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/19/apple-explains-how-to-clean-its-polishing-cloth-without-buying-a-new-polishing-cloth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has brought those instructions to our attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="howto-title"&gt;Are you ready? Here’s how Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210229"&gt;“How to clean the nano-texture glass on your Apple display” support article&lt;/a&gt; describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p6tXWq"&gt;1. Hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxbtus"&gt;2. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJZx08"&gt;3. Allow the polishing cloth to air dry for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vuuGd8"&gt;The instructions have been on Apple’s website for at least a few months, according to the WayBack Machine, but despite a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/26/apples-cleaning-cloth-is-sold-out-through-january----get-this-instead"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them, I hadn’t come across them. That’s really a shame — other people who also hadn’t known about the instructions might’ve been throwing away their priceless polishers all because of a little grime, wasting $20 simply because the cleaning instructions are buried on a support page instead of being included on a tag, or embossed on the cloth itself. (I would also settle for prime placement on the Apple home page, where all people of the cloth spend their day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0Mv0"&gt;The instructions themselves are also a little disappointing — ultimately, Apple is telling us to wash the cloth like we would any other delicate fabric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;At least it’s back in stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
