    <title>Nvidia says it won’t nerf the Ethereum mining performance of existing GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqgySS"&gt;This morning, Nvidia announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;it would artificially reduce the performance&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming $329 GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card when it comes to one specific task: Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. As weird as that news might sound, it was music to the ears of some gamers — who have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;trying and failing to get their hands on graphics cards for months&lt;/a&gt; due to the great GPU shortage, and blaming miners for part of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z1vOq"&gt;You might be wondering: what does this mean for &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; GPUs? Nvidia isn’t talking about its plans for future graphics card just yet, but the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (in no uncertain terms) that it won’t nerf existing GPUs. “We are not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold,” says a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qirJu6"&gt;I was also a bit skeptical that the company’s new batch of Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) cards, marketed as an alternative for those miners, would mean that gamers might actually be able to buy an RTX 3060 as a result. If Nvidia’s diverting its already limited production capacity of GPUs towards CMPs, doesn’t that mean fewer gaming GPUs to begin with? There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;a global semiconductor shortage going on&lt;/a&gt;, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbZfwBYTG6BGCgUQDVO5SM_MAqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312133/xV6u2t6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PCC3lj"&gt;But Nvidia strongly suggests the new CMPs won’t impact the ability to produce GeForce gaming cards at all. “The chips used for CMP could not meet the specifications of GeForce and don’t impact overall GeForce capacity or availability,” replied a spokesperson by email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TJoGD"&gt;While Nvidia wouldn’t confirm that it’s talking about binning — the process by which chipmakers like Intel, AMD, Nvidia and others take chips that aren’t 100 percent operational due to occasional manufacturing defects, and sell them as slower or less feature-filled parts instead — the statement certainly sounds something like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZnqeM"&gt;But it could also be that they’re different altogether. The shot you see above of Nvidia’s CMP looks nothing like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FritzchensFritz/status/1338201495007793152/photo/3"&gt;the layout of Nvidia’s GA102&lt;/a&gt; used in the Ampere-based RTX 3080 and 3090, or the &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/photo-gallery/Article/3035?image=big_geforce-rtx-3070-die-shot.jpg&amp;amp;tag=popup"&gt;GA104&lt;/a&gt; used in the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti. It doesn’t look much &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130561288@N04/50914796651/"&gt;like Nvidia’s previous-gen Turing desktop chips&lt;/a&gt;, either. Perhaps the CMP is simply a GPU design that hasn’t publicly been revealed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KDZY2B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Real GA102 Ampere Die-Shot, very close to the official rendering. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qLUhzylT7B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qLUhzylT7B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fritzchens Fritz (@FritzchensFritz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FritzchensFritz/status/1338201495007793152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkVR8p"&gt;If so, it’s vaguely possible that Nvidia has a stockpile of older chips it’s putting to use. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;bringing back the GTX 1050 Ti from 2016&lt;/a&gt;, after all, and it’s doubtful that Nvidia switched over one of the RTX 30-series factories just to make that happen. But without knowing what the CMP actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, your guess is as good as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTCZnm"&gt;Lastly, you might be wondering: why only nerf Ethereum mining, when other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have also seen incredible gains? Here’s Nvidia’s full answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="egtKnZ"&gt;Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining. Other algorithms do not contribute significantly to GPU demand and this cannot change quickly due to network effects within a given cryptocurrency. The rate limiter applies to anything that uses Dagger Hashimoto or Ethash-like algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="knJzfP"&gt;We’re looking forward to seeing whether Nvidia can make the $329 GeForce RTX 3060 any easier to buy than previous GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;when it launches February 25th at 12PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. After months of around-the-clock hunting, I finally managed to nab a 3060 Ti a couple weeks back — here’s hoping you won’t need to go that far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 Game Developers Conference won’t have in-person gatherings after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7f0llgtfi0rI-2UY045O35NfCZo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68840089/acastro_200302_1777_GDC_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Isntqq"&gt;The Game Developers Conference is changing course from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365498/gdc-2021-game-developers-conference-event-physical-hybrid-coronavirus-july-san-francisco"&gt;original (potentially risky) plan&lt;/a&gt; of hosting a hybrid in-person / digital event in 2021. According to &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/news/new-approach-2021-family-gdc-events-and-more"&gt;an announcement on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, GDC 2021 will be all-digital and split into three separate events to better and more safely accommodate the networking, games showcases, and instructional workshops and panels the event is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRA2ZZ"&gt;The series of events will start with GDC Masterclass, a collection of virtual workshops and trainings for developers that will take place on March 4th and 5th. GDC Showcase, which will be open to the public and free to attend, will run from March 15th through 19th, featuring networking and lectures in “a new array of content and formats.” Finally, GDC 2021 proper will take place during the week of July 19th as a business and education-focused event. &lt;a href="https://igf.com/article/igf-2021-accepts-over-500-excellent-entries"&gt;The Independent Games Festival (IGF)&lt;/a&gt; will also take place that week on July 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQhseh"&gt;Last year’s GDC was pushed back to the summer and held digitally, retitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243284/gdc-summer-event-digital"&gt;as GDC Summer&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping the events digital in 2021 ensures the conference won’t become a potential COVID-19 superspreader event, a concern that hasn’t stopped this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt; from moving forward as an in-person convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ3v0a"&gt;Another added benefit of going digital is that it could make GDC 2021 a lot more accessible. Attending GDC in past years has been &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gdc-at-a-crossroads/"&gt;prohibitively expensive for some independent developers&lt;/a&gt; even before including the cost of staying in San Francisco for a week. A digital event should allow more people to attend without the expense of travel. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blackmagic’s new ‘Pro’ Pocket Cinema Camera 6K adds the tilt-screen the original needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dE8UfjU_kHe62jxzrsNDZTdzZqQ=/561x0:2049x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839828/hero_lg_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blackmagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdfaqQ"&gt;Blackmagic is releasing a new, “Pro” version of its Pocket Cinema Camera 6K, which looks to fix a lot of the pain points &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20903307/blackmagic-pocket-cinema-camera-6k-review-test-features-specs-price"&gt;we found in the original&lt;/a&gt;. It adds a tiltable, brighter screen (and an optional electronic viewfinder attachment), a bigger battery, and built-in ND. The camera is slotting into Blackmagic’s line-up above the regular 6K, coming in at $2,495, about $500 more than the non-Pro version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDjsdn"&gt;While the new features still won’t make the camera ideal for consumers, they will bring some quality-of-life improvements to filmmakers and video production houses on a budget — especially that tiltable screen. I’ve used a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera before, and it’s a dream mounted on a tripod at eye-level, but an ergonomic nightmare when you’re trying to get a shot handheld or at a high or low angle. Being able to tilt the screen up or down will help make the camera easier to use, and could even remove the need for an external monitor, depending on your shooting style.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89tp0SrgZ4I2P5p44GKtqOSgonQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313574/uses_xl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blackmagic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This would be an annoying shot to get with the regular version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5qRcHZ"&gt;In our review, we also found that the original Pocket Cinema 6K’s display was hard to view outdoors, but the Pro has two different solutions for that. One is that the screen now runs at 1,500 nits, which is as bright or brighter than most of &lt;a href="https://smallhd.com/collections/focus-pro?product_id=5117267476613&amp;amp;variant_id=34439571275909&amp;amp;product_handle=focus-pro"&gt;SmallHD’s dedicated on-camera monitors&lt;/a&gt;, and should help the monitor’s visibility in bright sunlight. The second is an optional, $500 OLED electronic viewfinder, which uses a dedicated (but seemingly proprietary) connector instead of taking up the camera’s single HDMI port like a &lt;a href="https://www.zacuto.com/gratical-evf"&gt;Zacuto EVF&lt;/a&gt; would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0ftrZ"&gt;To power all that, it uses a larger battery than the original, but Blackmagic only quotes an hour of shooting time with the screen at 50 percent brightness (though that is an improvement over the original’s estimated 45 minutes). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l34hyT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pro is more competitive with Canon’s C100 MK II&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEdeDx"&gt;More exciting, especially for those who shoot outside a lot, are the built-in ND filters. The camera has four built-in filters that cut down light by two, four, and six stops for when the sun is shining a bit too brightly. Of course, I would’ve loved to see &lt;a href="https://www.newsshooter.com/2016/11/09/sony-introduce-fs7-ii-with-electronic-variable-nd-locking-e-mount-and-higher-price/"&gt;an electronically variable ND filter&lt;/a&gt; like on Sony’s cameras, which provide a continuous range instead of discreet stops, but at this price point I can understand why Blackmagic didn’t go that route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvnGTT"&gt;Throw in an extra mini-XLR jack for a total of two, and the Pro is a nice upgrade to the original Pocket 6K. It also makes the camera more competitive with Canon’s C100 Mark II, which has a similar Super-35 sensor, EF mount, and built-in ND. The cameras may appeal to different types of shooters, but I know I’ve found myself cross-shopping Canon and Blackmagic’s offerings before, especially when I’m uncertain about what type of projects I want to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9X74e"&gt;If, like me, you were put off by some of the asterisks and caveats of the original version, the Pro version may be worth another look — especially since all the extra features come at a relatively low price premium.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The carbon-fiber Vaio Z is the world’s lightest laptop with an Intel H-series chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aVfjZT95KeBbMEPYW4RRYq7i8uw=/384x274:2240x1511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839804/FUJI_8_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTdwvM"&gt;Vaio is known for making laptops that pack a surprising amount of power into unbelievably thin form factors. The Vaio Z may be the company’s most ambitious product yet. It contains up to Intel’s four-core Core i7-11357H — and at a starting weight of 2.11 pounds, it’ll be the lightest laptop ever to house an Intel H-series processor. (Though &lt;a href="https://us.vaio.com/collections/vaio-z"&gt;models you can buy in the US&lt;/a&gt; are 2.32 pounds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im9d4x"&gt;Part of the reason the Vaio Z is so light is that it’s the first laptop ever to be made of “contoured carbon fiber.” You’ll find carbon fiber in some of the nicest lightweight laptops on the market, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS line&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a sturdy and lightweight material. But those laptops utilize sheets of carbon fiber that are held together with metal or plastic parts. Vaio has actually contoured the material around the edges of the Z’s chassis, so it’s carbon fiber all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GCM1o"&gt;Vaio says the device has passed 26 “surface drop” tests, and will deliver up to 13 and a half hours of battery life. In terms of other specs, you can get up to 2TB of storage, 32GB of memory, Iris Xe integrated graphics, and either an FHD or a 4K  14-inch display. There’s a backlit keyboard, a webcam with a physical shutter, a full-size HDMI port, and two USB-C ports as well. The chassis is a clamshell, though you can fold the screen down to 180 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ct42wl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HROBewgmVTk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HttiQg"&gt;Of course, this all doesn’t come cheap. The Vaio Z starts at — I’m not joking — $3,579. So it won’t be a practical purchase for most people, but it’s still an impressive achievement and an interesting proof-of-concept. Keep an eye out for our full review in a few days, where we’ll dive into the performance you can expect for that price. You can &lt;a href="https://us.vaio.com/products/vaio-z?variant=33061213405259"&gt;preorder&lt;/a&gt; units now on Vaio’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hill Report: who wants to talk to Reddit?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CFPB Director Kathleen Kraninger Testifies On Protecting Consumers During Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-m8xE-O7SpQJcRM3BVZ69nL1AaA=/0x0:3975x2650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839637/1227843495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRsjub"&gt;Weeks after Reddit community r/WallStreetBets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;shitposted GameStop stock up to more than $400 a share&lt;/a&gt;, the House Financial Services Committee pulled all of the major players in for questioning on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xW60I6"&gt;The hearing featured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxutSI"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev&lt;/strong&gt;, whose commission-free brokerage platform made WallStreetBets’ GameStop short squeeze possible — well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;until it didn’t&lt;/a&gt;, and the app froze all meme trading for hours, angering both the meme traders, lawmakers, and regulators, creating the conditions for our hearing today!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZMNQkG"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reddit CEO Steve Huffman&lt;/strong&gt;, who, in his opening remarks, basically just explained what Reddit is, providing a dictionary-style definition of “subreddits” for lawmakers. After that, he didn’t say much else. No one was asking him questions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RIbyyt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Keith Gill&lt;/strong&gt;, better known by his Reddit pseudonyms, RoaringKitty and u/DeepFuckingValue, who rather than donning his infamous red headband, hung it behind him next to an inspirational poster of a cat encouraging us all to “Hang in there.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mhe8XY"&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Kenneth C. Griffin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Plotkin&lt;/strong&gt;, CEOs of Citadel and Melvin Capital, respectively. We’re not going to talk about them too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ937f"&gt;Robinhood was clearly the focus. The company’s app facilitated the r/WallStreetBets January GameStop squeeze until, as Tenev puts it, the company couldn’t any longer. At the height of the meme-trading frenzy, Robinhood pulled the plug on popular stocks like GameStop and AMC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;prompting lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to call for this hearing to investigate the company’s relationships with hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3U1oI"&gt;At Thursday’s hearing, Tenev tried to dispel those rumors. “We don’t answer to hedge funds,” he said. “We serve millions of small investors who use our platform every day to invest.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnY4TI"&gt;Throughout the hearing, Tenev assured lawmakers that Robinhood had to halt meme stock trading because its business partners — the clearinghouses that &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;perform the trades — bumped up how much money it would cost the company to finish them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Whhu5"&gt;Tenev apologized for pausing those trades and promised to do better in the future — typical remarks from a congressional witness in the hot seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rk02So"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MWV9IQ"&gt;For a hearing investigating what happens when a bunch of Redditors disrupt the US financial markets, social media’s role in the GameStop squeeze wasn’t really a major part of Thursday’s hearing. But for the lawmakers focused on the internet’s influence in January’s events, they appeared deeply concerned about how social media discourse can cause real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHiFlr"&gt;Now, what happened to the bemoaned video game retailer’s stock price in January does not even remotely come close to the fallout of the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol that also took place that month, but it plays into how lawmakers are looking to regulate social media post-Trump. For example, earlier this month, Senate Democrats took their first stab at reforming Section 230 by introducing a bill, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;called the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, that bill would open tech companies, like Reddit and Facebook, up to lawsuits if the platforms host abusive content targeting specific users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVqQXG"&gt;It was the first big moderation bill to drop after the deadly attack at the Capitol, and importantly, it could set the tone for future discussions around regulating tech platforms. That message clearly found its way across the Capitol from the Senate into the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLliBn"&gt;Rep. David Scott (D-GA), asking Tenev if Robinhood engages in content moderation on social media — it doesn’t, and why would it? — brought up this line of thinking: “This episode [the GameStop-Reddit saga] exposes a serious threat to our financial system when tweets and social media posts do more to move the market than material, legitimate information,” Scott said. “The risk is enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqOwBy"&gt;Now, Scott’s take may not be mine, but it serves as an example of how lawmakers are tying together forum discussions and real-world action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXZF8X"&gt;Responding to one lawmaker, I think Huffman raised an important counterpoint: “WallStreetBets may look sophomoric or chaotic from the outside, but the fact that we are here today means they’ve managed to raise important issues about fairness and opportunity in our financial system,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0MkmD"&gt;This balance will be difficult to strike if Congress proceeds on legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kcXrpx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="uP5U5m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, wins 18 trillion bonus points for this gem in House Financial Committee testimony:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A few things I am not: &lt;br&gt;I am not a cat;&lt;br&gt;I am not an institutional investor;&lt;br&gt;Nor am I a hedge fund"&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamestop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#gamestop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5W9UkQcG95"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5W9UkQcG95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yaël (@YaelOss) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/1362477126365151232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F6BlU9"&gt;The meme stock hearing’s most viral meme has to come from RoaringKitty’s opening statement. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;a Zoom filter of a cat&lt;/a&gt; got stuck on a lawyer’s face before a live court hearing, and the following video clip became a viral meme. Despite going by a cat-related username, Gill appeared to refer to the infamous lawyer cat in his opening remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipln4O"&gt;“A few things I am not: I am not a cat. I am not an institutional investor, nor am I a hedge fund,” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK12gL"&gt;It’s not the first time that white cat filter has been invoked in Congress. Watch a member of the House Financial Services Committee have trouble with Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;story from earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2j4fo4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bVhO1U"&gt;Sitting through this hearing, I was waiting and waiting for Huffman to be on the receiving end of any meaningful line of questioning, seeing as he was the only witness who leads a social media company. Reddit may not be as big as Facebook, but it’s been at the center of some of the internet’s ugliest scenes, from /r/creepshots to Gamergate. Still, Huffman made his opening statement at the top of the hearing, and it took around an hour and a half before he said anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IocrVm"&gt;Here’s what I would’ve liked to hear from Huffman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RAgNxG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kellymakena/status/1362456841247207429?s=20"&gt;In Huffman’s opening remarks&lt;/a&gt;, he said that Reddit employees acted as “diplomats’’ to help soothe disagreements within r/WallStreetBets’ leadership during the height of the squeeze. Why did Reddit step in in such a way? Has Reddit ever had similar conversations with other subreddit moderators? If so, which subreddits, and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AisaSz"&gt;To what extent was r/WallStreetBets’ GameStop short squeeze a content moderation issue? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3ct4qC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OZcPPs"&gt;Thursday’s hearing was just the first in a series following the Reddit-GameStop short squeeze. Chair Waters said in an interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle Thursday that she plans to hold two more hearings before ending the committee’s investigation. It’s not clear when those additional hearings, one being an expert listening session and another focusing on legislation, are scheduled to take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naUesy"&gt;The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), also said last month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;it would hold a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on “the current state of the stock market” in the wake of the unprecedented market volatility around GameStop and other meme stocks. Still, Brown has yet to make any official announcements regarding that hearing or any additional actions the committee may take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsltBI"&gt;But in a flurry of letters Thursday morning, Banking Committee member Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) started taking measures into her own hands. Warren wrote to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-to-finra-in-wake-of-robinhood-controversy-how-will-you-level-the-playing-field-for-individual-investors"&gt;prompting the body&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Robinhood’s relationship with Citadel and asking it to ensure that retail investors aren’t disadvantaged by these relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1h7quA"&gt;And of course, the Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating the GameStop saga on its own. In an interview with CNBC Thursday before the hearing, SEC Chair Hester Peirce didn’t provide much information on how the SEC plans to respond, but he did suggest short-selling limitations may be in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cVlKap"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U068kf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMMmFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 developer preview feature roundup: improved emergency calls, bigger notifications, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI3Ezq7mZQa4ZStX2MPROKiSB2I=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839346/VRG_1777_Android_12_006.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DM9Pmo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is out&lt;/a&gt;, and the internet is busy poring over it to find any new features or hints at the OS’s future. So far, there have been a few interesting things discovered, such as an Emergency SOS feature, some redesigns, and other useful, if minor, finds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2qBspY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-you-can-now-enable-or-disable-specific-app-quick-settings-media-controls/"&gt;The ability to prevent specific apps from showing media controls in quick settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7RYQ6b"&gt;The ability to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-wifi-passwords-nearby-share/"&gt;wirelessly share Wi-Fi passwords to people nearby with the tap of a button&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R2QfJU"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-markup-screenshots/"&gt;update to Markup that lets you put emoji (and text) on screenshots&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lp8afp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362478110583775232"&gt;Bluetooth pairing options are now included in the media picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="20Djz1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362463236294135812?s=20"&gt;A reduce bright colors accessibility option&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Rouxm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/gaming-with-a-controller-could-feel-a-lot-better-on-android-12/"&gt;Improved gamepad rumble support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tX9x3b"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12s-new-toggle-design-is-big-and-bold-and-were-not-sure-what-to-think-of-it/"&gt;A toggle switch redesign&lt;/a&gt; (that looks really nice in my opinion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dbQGkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/pixel-5s-hole-punch-can-be-hidden-on-android-12/"&gt;A developer option to hide the Pixel’s hole-punch camera cutout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CKGBLR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-pixel-launcher-4x5-grid/"&gt;The addition of a 4 x 5 grid option to the Pixel Launcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xQwE0S"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12s-gestures-navigation-works-better-in-full-screen-and-immersive-views/"&gt;You can now gesture out of full-screen apps with a single swipe instead of two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VSyb1A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/18/android-12-adds-emergency-sos-with-five-taps-of-the-power-button/"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Emergency SOS feature is also much easier to access now. Before, making an emergency call required you to hold the power button down, tap the emergency button, then tap twice on the Call 911 button. In Android 12, however, it can be activated by rapidly pressing the power button five times, which will trigger a countdown telling you that an emergency call is about to be placed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cl5aG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that, by default, it calls 911. You can set it to call a different number, but if the number isn’t a government-run emergency line, your phone will have to be unlocked for the call to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rl0gcF3ID8VwV9yKK6p3OuH3UxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313233/Screenshot_20210218_121043.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer preview’s emergency call UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oBs2NF"&gt;There have been a few minor redesigns of the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/"&gt;Settings app search bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-lockscreen-and-notification-shade-media-player-gets-minor-ui-redesign/"&gt;the lock screen and notification media player&lt;/a&gt;, but Mishaal Rahman found a feature flag that “dramatically” changes the settings UI to be easier to use one-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zL3kvp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BIG change: If you enable the "Silky home" feature flag that I previously mentioned, you'll get a DRAMATICALLY changed Settings UI that's MUCH more one-handed friendly. Here are a few screenshots: &lt;a href="https://t.co/EcwqnU0LlB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EcwqnU0LlB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362462608826195976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sIbt8K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/"&gt;has also found that some screens in the settings app&lt;/a&gt; have blue-tinted backgrounds. It speculates that it could be part of a rumored theming system, but at the moment, it seems very unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2s6V4j0taoI9ZQhK7Ddm-Wz7Tk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313204/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_12.43.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-settings-app-gets-revamp-w-new-search-bar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5hJw8Y"&gt;Of course, notifications have also gotten a redesign, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-notifications-redesigned-w-bigger-icons-dedicated-snooze-button/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; noting&lt;/a&gt; that there’s a dedicated snooze button now, and the icon bubbles are now much larger. This looks like it reduces the density of notifications, but it’s still very early days for Android 12, so it’s possible changes could be made or toggles could be added to control whether you want to see the larger app icon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUErMwjizN3A6eaHU8juCNCrMJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313267/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_1.07.22_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The app icon bubbles are now larger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ2BNW"&gt;There are also a few features that are hinted at, or even have settings present, but currently don’t seem to work or aren’t enabled, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hpQbX6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-scrolling-screenshot/"&gt;Scrolling screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eyLggC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-dp1-pixel-double-tap-gesture-assistant-columbus/"&gt;A Pixel 5 double-tap feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lJruiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362498569081618435"&gt;A one-handed mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDPTlG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/18/android-12-privacy-toggles/"&gt;Privacy toggles to turn cameras and microphones off system-wide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D98pvo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362518136113815556?s=20"&gt;Pinch-to-resize picture-in-picture video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0CgL"&gt;Given the early state of the developer preview, it’s not really meant for day-to-day use on your main phone. And as with all betas, these features and designs are subject to change in new releases. Still, it’s a tantalizing glimpse at the future of Android and the features Google is adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285299/android-11-beta-features-notifications-bubbles-permissions-smart-home-video-google"&gt;to an already feature-packed mature OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuK9b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 8:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added some new features that have been found since this article was first posted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey will appear at March misinfo hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-ANTI-TRUST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ht5zLkSAQ1h9nfjT7KHh0-JBdHo=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68839012/1227829337.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by GRAEME JENNINGS/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8knLnG"&gt;The House Energy and Commerce Committee has called a new hearing on platform misinformation to include testimony from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Scheduled for March 25th, the hearing will be a joint effort from the Communications and Technology subcommittee and the Consumer Protection and Commerce subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQRAvQ"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey are all scheduled to testify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD6bnx"&gt;“This hearing will continue the Committee’s work of holding online platforms accountable for the growing rise of misinformation and disinformation,” the chairs of the committees said in a joint statement. “For far too long, big tech has failed to acknowledge the role they’ve played in fomenting and elevating blatantly false information to its online audiences. Industry self-regulation has failed. We must begin the work of changing incentives driving social media companies to allow and even promote misinformation and disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OnNgL"&gt;Dorsey and Zuckerberg were previously called before Congress in November, for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/17/tech-hearing-dorsey-zuckerberg/"&gt;the Senate Judiciary’s impromptu hearing&lt;/a&gt; on moderation and misinformation labeling. However, this will be the first hearing they have attended since the January 6th attack on the US Capitol and the various deplatforming efforts that followed. All three companies have since removed former President Donald Trump from their platforms (in Google’s case, through YouTube), actions that remain deeply controversial among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is having another go at explaining its privacy policy to users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WhatsApp stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8F9yHgB-gRXv5FBQwFwWmGhkHs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838853/WhatsApp1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGM3dT"&gt;WhatsApp has a new plan to explain its contentious privacy policy — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; when users grew concerned the platform would share their messages with parent company Facebook. In an announcement on Thursday, the company explained how users can read through the new policy and learn how business and personal messages — which have different privacy standards — are handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaTmBM"&gt;The new privacy policy primarily concerns messaging businesses on WhatsApp and what parts of your data those businesses have access to. Most WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they can only be accessed by the people actually talking. But WhatsApp also lets users message businesses, and those messages aren’t extended the same protections. The data in business messages can be used for commercial purposes like ad targeting on Facebook, and some of them are also stored on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp’s privacy policy was an attempt to explain that change, but many users interpreted it as WhatsApp comprising the privacy focus it was known for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mk5JhiEgy3brAIplu44ieGNlXdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312921/image002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s new banner and privacy policy explainer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="92FNL4"&gt;Ahead of the new May 15th launch (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;moved from February 8th&lt;/a&gt;), WhatsApp plans to offer users the ability to review this new privacy policy inside its app. The company already tried to reassure users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22257721/whatsapp-status-privacy-facebook-signal-telegram"&gt;through WhatsApp’s Status feature&lt;/a&gt;, but now WhatsApp will include a banner that can be tapped to pull up the explanation of the new policy. The company says it will eventually remind users to read the new policy and accept it to continue using the app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REd6tD"&gt;WhatsApp also notes that businesses pay for the right to use WhatsApp to reach customers, and that’s one of the ways WhatsApp is able to provide its app for free. The main features of WhatsApp remain as private as ever. Of course, it’s not as private as some users might think: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;WhatsApp started sharing some personal information&lt;/a&gt; like phone numbers and profile photos with Facebook in 2016 to improve friend recommendations and ads on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R81gUH"&gt;WhatsApp’s tone in this redo of its policy change is somewhat apologetic. It didn’t explain what was changing well enough to users, and it’s owning up to that. But WhatsApp also managed to sneak in a dig at other companies that welcomed the exodus from WhatsApp prompted by the policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0irFGs"&gt;During this time, we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer. We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages — if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages. Other apps say they’re better because they know even less information than WhatsApp. We believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data. We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gVSiP3"&gt;WhatsApp is obliquely referencing Telegram, an app that, along with Signal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349014065931284480%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226792%2Fwhatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;seemed to benefit&lt;/a&gt; from the confusion over what was changing in WhatsApp. Telegram &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415"&gt;has dealt with its own criticism&lt;/a&gt; over not enabling end-to-end encryption by default — and clearly, WhatsApp doesn’t want you to forget that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover successfully lands on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zajpO1lw5Ojig9Lg2-SzH4p_oKQ=/0x36:1321x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838834/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The first image taking by NASA’s Perseverance rover after touching down on Thursday. | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYE31Q"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover has successfully touched down on the surface of Mars after surviving a blazing seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere. The rover’s clean landing sets the stage for a years-long journey to scour the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater for ancient signs of life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iguGP-kNHRa9MVpqkhTcFm9cOL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313288/ayyy.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A live video feed from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California showed mission engineers cheer upon confirmation of a clean Perseverance touchdown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZYHdV"&gt;“Touchdown confirmed,” Swati Mohan, a member of NASA’s Entry, Descent, and Landing team, said. “Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars ready to begin seeking the signs of past life.” The landing team of roughly 30 engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California jumped from their seats and cheered at the confirmation. Moments after touching down, Perseverance beamed back its first image from one of its 19 cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxo4FE"&gt;Perseverance hit Mars’ atmosphere on time at 3:48PM ET at speeds of about 12,100 miles per hour, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287160/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-landing-watch-live-stream-start-time"&gt;diving toward the surface in an infamously challenging sequence&lt;/a&gt; engineers call the “seven minutes of terror.” With an 11-minute comms delay between Mars and Earth, the spacecraft had to carry out its seven-minute plunge at all by itself with a wickedly complex set of pre-programmed instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7U7WW7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m safe on Mars. Perseverance will get you anywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1362506126839848961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="upO6OS"&gt;Enduring blazing heat, the rover was shielded by a protective shell and parachute to help slow itself down. A descent stage with six rocket thrusters fired as it neared the surface, slowing Perseverance to a much calmer 2 mph. Clutching the rover, the descent stage hovered 66 feet above the surface to execute a “skycrane” maneuver, where it gently lowered Perseverance on a set of cables the rest of the way to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaOiCD"&gt;With its six wheels planted on the surface, the rover snipped the skycrane cables, prompting the rocket-powered descent stage to move itself far away from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znSrB8"&gt;The on-time landing at 3:55PM ET marks NASA’s sixth successful landing on the Red Planet. The $2.7 billion rover is essentially a 2,263-pound laboratory on wheels: for the next several years, Perseverance will traverse Mars’ Jezero Crater to collect soil samples for a future retrieval mission, analyze the makeup of Martian rocks with a laser-beaming camera system, and deploy a helicopter named Ingenuity, a four-foot-on wide rotorcraft that will demonstrate the first powered flight on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mvFI7"&gt;Spirits were high during a post-landing press conference. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s top science official, was elated and began his remarks on Perseverance’s landing victory by holding up a printout of the mission’s contingency plan — a blueprint for the team in case the mission goes awry — and ripping it in half. “Here’s for the contingency plan!” he said before tearing the paper apart and tossing it behind him, sparking applause in the JPL auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGyVOa"&gt;“Now the fun really starts,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. The science team is already analyzing the several low-res images the rover already beamed back to Earth, she said. More images will stream in throughout the week, with the first drop of audio coming as soon as Thursday night and the first high-definition video of Perseverance’s landing expected on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDeJFl"&gt;The SUV-sized rover has traveled 293 million miles since launching last summer atop an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance. It launched during a slim window of time as Earth and Mars closely aligned in their orbits around the Sun. That alignment only comes once every two years, and NASA launched its rover around the same time as China and UAE, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274189/uae-mars-hope-probe-spacecraft"&gt;whose Martian spacecraft also reached the planet&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. China’s Tianwen-1 probe, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276153/china-reaches-mars-tianwen-1-probe"&gt;arrived in Martian orbit on February 10th&lt;/a&gt;, will deploy a lander and rover in the coming months, joining Perseverance just over a thousand miles away on Mars’ surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWMdbh"&gt;Perseverance’s journey through space was even more uneventful than expected. Toward the end of its seven-month journey, Perseverance’s cruise stage carried out fewer orbital correction maneuvers than originally planned, in part due to an ultra-precise insertion on its Mars trajectory when it launched. “When we hit the bullseye, that means they had a ton more propellant” that NASA didn’t have to use on its journey to Mars, ULA CEO Tory Bruno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Unlike Tianwen-1, which is hanging out in orbit before heading to the surface, Perseverance booked it straight for the surface upon reaching Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4CxSP"&gt;The Jezero Crater posed the most challenging landing site NASA has faced. Perseverance had to steer clear of the crater’s steep cliffs, massive boulders, and dangerously sandy pits to reach its landing spot. Scientists believe the 28-mile-wide hole was a river delta some 3.5 billion years ago — potentially a goldmine for fossilized microorganisms. Its mix of different rock formations offers researchers a smorgasbord of potential samples to collect during its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epTQBd"&gt;Zurbuchen said Perseverance engineers are already moving forward with the next leg of NASA’s Mars ambitions: the sample return mission, a joint effort with the European Space Agency to send a fleet of spacecraft to Mars and retrieve the soil samples Perseverance will scatter around the Jezero crater.  That mission is slated to launch sometime in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzA7TQ"&gt;“Many concrete steps are also happening towards another horizon goal, which is human exploration of Mars as well,” Zurbuchen said, floating distant plans to send astronauts to the Red Planet sometime in the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBG0h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWJowx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A streamer completed a sweet, juicy Hades run using a literal pomegranate controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUTR9UEmkcppnZp_k44JK-2h2Go=/245x107:2635x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838631/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_9.01.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rudeism&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZmNE5X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, Supergiant Games’ Greek-themed roguelike, can be a pretty tough game. But one intrepid Twitch streamer took it upon himself to up the challenge by beating the game in an incredibly nontraditional way: by using a controller made out of an actual pomegranate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFQXBj"&gt;Pomegranates are a big part of the game, serving as &lt;a href="https://hades.gamepedia.com/Pom_of_Power"&gt;useful power-ups&lt;/a&gt;, and they also have an &lt;a href="https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/pomegranate-fruit-myths-made/"&gt;important place in Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;. But I never imagined that someone could use a real-life pomegranate to defeat the final boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7kEiK"&gt;To make the controller, streamer Dylan “Rudeism” Beck cut up a pomegranate into 10 pieces, wired the pieces to a &lt;a href="https://makeymakey.com/"&gt;MakeyMakey circuit board&lt;/a&gt; to make them act as capacitive touch buttons, and taped an earth wire from his arm to the board. Here’s how the contraption works, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM?t=221"&gt;according to Beck&lt;/a&gt;: “My arm will be connected to the MakeyMakey via the earth wire, and then when I touch one of the pomegranates, it then creates a loop between me, the pomegranate, and the circuit board, and that’s what does inputs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irc0rK"&gt;You can watch Beck put the controller together (and make his first attempt to beat the game with it) in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8MTdMb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEg3iC1O_HM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=257&amp;amp;start=257" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZHL5k"&gt;Beck first tried to play the game with a pomegranate &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911752639"&gt;six days ago&lt;/a&gt;, and he has been &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/913264431"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/917393094"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; ever since, chasing an elusive escape from the Underworld. Overnight, Beck finally did it, successfully defeating the game’s final boss in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1362376886827896832"&gt;an epic battle&lt;/a&gt; that included two heart-stopping controller failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dtgcs1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WE BEAT HADES WITH AN ACTUAL POMEGRANATE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEEDS EVERYWHERE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GREAT GAME &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SupergiantGames&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;a href="https://t.co/gAXPy5qEkF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gAXPy5qEkF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rudeism (@rudeism) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1362376886827896832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vcxDS"&gt;This isn’t Beck’s first attempt at playing a game with a nontraditional controller — it’s actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Rudeism/videos"&gt;kind of his thing&lt;/a&gt;. Among other notable feats, he won a round of the adorable battle royale platformer &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JDH8KC2vCxY"&gt;jelly beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
