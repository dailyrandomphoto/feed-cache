    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Note series will reportedly still continue next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FykqLPXh5_1AxlpxmbJlDf3ylOc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520572/vpavic_200807_4133_0116.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OgedEL"&gt;While Samsung’s mobile boss TM Roh has telegraphed plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;bring stylus support to more phones&lt;/a&gt; across its lineup, there may still be a new Galaxy Note in 2021. An anonymous Samsung official &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20201216007800320"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company is “preparing to release the Galaxy Note series next year” and that “Roh’s message does not mean that the Galaxy Note series will be discontinued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKkgVE"&gt;Samsung declined to comment on the specifics of &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;’s report when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but provided the following statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5GSu57"&gt;Samsung confirms plans to bring some of the most beloved features of the Galaxy Note to more device categories in 2021. We remain committed to providing the best mobile experience to our consumers and will continue to actively listen and consider consumer feedback in all our product innovations. We cannot share any further details at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5Tk1VA"&gt;The obvious question, if &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;’s report is accurate, is how Samsung will set the Note series apart. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;This year’s model&lt;/a&gt; already felt like you were paying for the S Pen support alone, considering how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; outpaced it on specs and undercut it on price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYhZSU"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was a more compelling — albeit expensive – proposition, but it’s hard to see how it’d fit alongside a presumable full complement of stylus-compatible Galaxy S21 devices with comparable screen sizes. And the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; shows that foldable phones may soon be a more broadly viable option at the top end of Samsung’s range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GlNSA"&gt;Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521860/samsung-galaxy-phones-january-2021-renders-leak"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to unveil its widely-leaked next flagship Galaxy S phones in January, a little earlier than usual. We’ll have to wait and see if that lineup leaves any gaps for a potential Note 21 to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will combat COVID-19 misinformation more directly with notifications to users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVfwVA1qNFxoVJDEVFHFKkq90G0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519578/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8IZWk"&gt;Facebook will send notifications directly to users who like, share, or comment on COVID-19 posts that violate the company’s terms of service, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90586312/facebook-notifications-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDY7Bl"&gt;This new feature works like this: if a user interacts with a post that’s later removed, Facebook sends a notification to the user telling them that the post was taken down. If the user clicks the notification, they’ll be taken to a landing page with a screenshot of the post and a short explanation for why it was removed. The landing page will also feature links to COVID-19 educational resources and actions, like unfollowing the group that posted it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGBScnSAWSudTUD0tbE9A_uRExo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173259/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_3.16.44_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Facebook, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90586312/facebook-notifications-covid-19-misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s updated anti-misinformation notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ejxt"&gt;This is an expansion of Facebook’s previous attempts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223456/facebook-coronavirus-misinformation-fake-news-warning-update-who"&gt;combat misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Before this, the company displayed a banner on the news feed, urging users who had engaged with content that had been removed, to “Help Friends and Family Avoid False Information About Covid-19.” But users were often confused at what the banner was referring to, a Facebook product manager told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company. &lt;/em&gt;The hope is that new approach is more direct than the banner, while still avoiding scolding users or re-exposing them to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook anti-misinformation box for the novel coronavirus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UgUxSaDSOI7iZcTOaYXveEvt9aU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19902115/InLine_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s previous anti-misinformation banner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nnRMPc"&gt;Facebook’s modified approach is arriving almost a year into the pandemic — a little late. The notifications don’t debunk claims in removed posts. They also don’t apply to posts that later have fact-checking labels put on them, &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; writes. That means less-dangerous misinformation still has the opportunity to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PVOUN"&gt;Facebook has been slow to act on misinformation that the company doesn’t consider dangerous. Though conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines have spread for months, Facebook only began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in December&lt;/a&gt;. The question now is: is this too little, and too late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxjiIw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOhXxz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s UK users will lose EU privacy protections next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MzW0u4Te0h4oYxefRTg2uyzaCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519496/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63rnoy"&gt;Facebook is moving its UK users out from under the strict privacy protections of the European Union, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-facebook-exclusive-idUSKBN28P2HM"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Users of the social media site, and of Instagram and WhatsApp, will have to sign a terms of service agreement in the coming months with Facebook’s headquarters in California, instead of its European branch based in the Republic of Ireland. Moving the user agreements to the US means that UK users will no longer be covered by data policies crafted to adhere to the EU’s stringent privacy regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdteRO"&gt;This change is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145180/google-uk-user-data-processing-ireland-usa-authorities-data-protection-gdpr-cloud-act"&gt;the one Google made&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. It’s meant to avoid a situation where UK citizens are no longer citizens of the European Union, but have agreements based in an EU country, where Facebook is subject to the EU’s data protection laws. Users will still be protected by the UK’s data privacy laws, &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/brexit/2617110/information-rights-and-brexit-faqs-v2_3.pdf"&gt;which currently mirror the EU’s GDPR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2iNrsR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VECGOH"&gt;Some UK privacy advocates are concerned the UK could eventually weaken its privacy laws once it’s outside the EU. The executive director of Open Rights Group said to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “[t]he bigger the company, the more personal data they hold, the more they are likely to be subject to surveillance duties or requirements to hand over data to the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64t5cM"&gt;The worries aren’t founded on nothing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17131004/cloud-act-congress-omnibus-passed-mlat"&gt;Back in 2018, the US passed the CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easier for the US government to share US companies’ data with foreign law enforcement (which UK agencies would count as).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiQ6qj"&gt;There’s also the matter of bargaining. Because the UK &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47213842"&gt;will no longer be included&lt;/a&gt; in the EU’s trade agreements, the country will have to start making their own — and privacy advocates are worried about what protections the US may ask to be given up in negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f86pNt"&gt;Facebook’s UK branch told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “there will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK,” but users of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram will have to re-agree to the terms and conditions again, which Facebook will ask them to do sometime in the next six months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service is now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJ9WHxxGyq2Rhs5Nm7V30-eksBk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519418/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rYXHRy"&gt;Amazon’s cloud gaming service, Luna, is now available on Android, Amazon announced on Tuesday. Like the iOS version of Luna, there’s no separate Luna app to download — instead, you’ll access the service through the Chrome web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgYRKn"&gt;Amazon launched Luna in early access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525435/amazon-luna-early-access-cloud-gaming"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, where it was initially available on PC, Mac, Fire TV, and on iPhone and iPad via web apps. The service works on a channels-based model, where you pay a monthly fee for each channel of games you want access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A87li1"&gt;Right now, there are two channels available. Amazon’s $5.99-per-month Luna Plus channel has games from many different publishers, and Ubisoft’s $14.99-per-month Ubisoft Plus channel offers Ubisoft games. (Paying that $14.99-per-month fee for the Ubisoft Plus channel also gives you access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;Ubisoft Plus on PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174222/ubisoft-plus-google-stadia-support-live-now-game-subscription-service"&gt;on Google’s cloud gaming service, Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRVMnf"&gt;Luna only available in the US right now, and if you don’t have early access already, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can request it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you do have early access and want to start playing Luna on Android, follow the instructions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonluna/status/1338974518556065792?s=20"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4N1n6x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheCodeB00K?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheCodeB00K&lt;/a&gt;, as Raghu from Team Luna explains below, you won’t have to wait very long for Android support (or, like, at all). Play Luna with early access now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/IU81kXZouU"&gt;https://t.co/IU81kXZouU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aVDCbQcP64"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aVDCbQcP64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon Luna (@amazonluna) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonluna/status/1338974518556065792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AjWzn2"&gt;Right now, Luna’s Android version works on some Pixel, Samsung, and OnePlus devices, but Amazon says Luna will add support for more Android devices during Luna’s early access period. An Amazon spokesperson shared a list of currently-supported devices with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lmKAjb"&gt;Pixel 4XL, 4A, 4A 5G, 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3LNDEl"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, Note 10, Note 10 Plus, S20, S20 Plus, S20 Ultra, Note 20, Note 20 Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qjqocy"&gt;OnePlus 7, 7 Pro, 7 Pro 5G, 8, 8 Pro, Nord, 7T, 7T Pro, 7T Pro 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mgXSp0"&gt;You’ll also need to be using Android 9 or higher and Chrome version 86 or newer. You’ll be able to play games using &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?ots=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21289476%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s own Luna controller&lt;/a&gt; as well as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One controller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail was messed up for a ‘significant’ number of users today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q90TphPk8CdZVscZdQE7icK1gVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518536/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUAAel"&gt;Google says that a “significant subset” of Gmail users ran into errors with the service Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJZcLL"&gt;While users could access their inboxes, they may have encountered “error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab"&gt;a message&lt;/a&gt; on its service status page. Google said the issues with Gmail were resolved at 6:51PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmEhxM"&gt;The errors came just a day after many Google properties, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, were hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173803/gmail-youtube-google-assistant-docs-down-outage"&gt;a widespread outage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fmTpt"&gt;Downdetector, which monitors reports of website issues, showed a spike of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/"&gt;impacting Gmail&lt;/a&gt; starting around 3PM ET. Users reported being unable to access their inboxes, while others have said they were receiving bounceback messages when trying to email someone with a Gmail address. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1338969496283963392"&gt;ProtonMail said&lt;/a&gt; that emails sent to Gmail users were “permanently bouncing,” returning error messages to the original sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tk4htV"&gt;Stadia, Google’s cloud gaming service, was also having issues this afternoon, but it’s unclear if they were related. The company said a problem was “prohibiting some users from launching games.” Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the issue with Stadia had been resolved at 4:31PM ET and that “users should be able to play games as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqNq69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says the problems with Gmail have now been fixed. This article has been updated to reflect that the issues are resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i4t5Vz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gmail, YouTube, Google Docs, and other Google services hit by massive outage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173803/gmail-youtube-google-assistant-docs-down-outage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UFUuOC"&gt;Activists working for the influential youth-led environmental group, Sunrise Movement, have voted to form a union, they announced today. Some 96 percent of Sunrise workers voted for the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAnwOy"&gt;The group, which has pushed for a Green New Deal, will form a union with Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 1180 in New York, CWA represents other big-name advocacy groups such as Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dtwN3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sunrise Movement unequivocally supports, and fights for, the right of any and all workers to unionize.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GkYQEY"&gt;“When we talk about creating millions of good jobs through a Green New Deal, we mean jobs where people get paid well, with the protections they deserve and that the labor movement fought for,” Sunrise Movement Executive Director Varshini Prakash said in a statement today. “Sunrise Movement unequivocally supports, and fights for, the right of any and all workers to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4OOOB"&gt;The votes were validated by Senator Ed Markey, a long-time Sunrise ally who spoke at a live-streamed announcement today. The organization has 110 staff members; about 80 of them will be eligible to join the union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5eb4c"&gt;Sunrise Movement, founded in 2017, gained momentum thanks to a huge network of grassroots organizers — the majority of whom are unpaid. There are thousands more Sunrise supporters that are volunteers, according to Sunrise. Volunteers will not be part of the union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8imHQP"&gt;When asked about whether Sunrise workers are pushing for any particular protections or benefits, Gabbi Pierce, internal communications coordinator at Sunrise, said that wasn’t a primary focus. Instead, workers unionized in order to gain tools that would let them deal with employment issues when they come up, “to protect what we have as workers in an organization that we really value,” Pierce said. “We’re more motivated to organize to protect what we like in our jobs, and what we have in our jobs.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2q49i"&gt;The announcement follows the high-profile exit of former Sunrise regional organizer Akshai Singh. In July, Singh tweeted that they were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fired “in the midst of a union organizing campaign.” In response, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/njansen16/status/1281707239724769280"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from other Sunrise staff said that Singh was “let go due to their performance, not retaliation for union activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SYVxhA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m a queer organizer of color fighting for a just transition from militarized fossil fuel apartheid. Today I was fired from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@sunrisemvmt&lt;/a&gt; — in the midst of a union organizing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;— Akshai Singh  ⚽️  ️‍ ✊  (@chezrebellion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chezrebellion/status/1281659935651176449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUOCji"&gt;“All I want to say to that is that Sunrise management and leadership hasn’t engaged in union busting or any anti-union tactics,” Pierce told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; when asked about Singh’s exit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="r85qND"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The organization has alienated a lot of people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EXpVvU"&gt;Singh’s departure&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in July struck a nerve, particularly among &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnspiracy/status/1281663613757874176"&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/janicluo/status/1281693736074833920"&gt;volunteers&lt;/a&gt; who decided to leave the organization after experiencing burnout. A recent episode of the popular Netflix show Queer Eye also profiled a Sunrise movement organizer whose mother worried that she was devoting all of her time and energy to the group’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glq5gc"&gt;“The organization has alienated a lot of people,” says Lynn Wang, who was a hub coordinator for Sunrise in Los Angeles before deciding to leave at the start of this year. “I think Sunrise maybe wants to put this behind them a little bit and move on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgR2sw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddpTH6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boring Company proposes massive Vegas expansion following monorail bankruptcy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nhPd6FCcH4OBphWB_-7St7ML3eo=/169x0:1816x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518938/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_4.03.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9w46l"&gt;Elon Musk’s tunneling venture, The Boring Company, is planning a massive &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173076/63996761.pdf"&gt;citywide expansion&lt;/a&gt; of the currently modest underground transportation system it’s building in Las Vegas. The startup now wants to build a 10-mile sub-surface “loop” that serves the famous Las Vegas Strip of casino hotels and reaches the city’s downtown area as well as McCarran International Airport, all with Tesla vehicles. The Boring Company also wants to build an additional loop that connects properties owned by Caesars Entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtyMuK"&gt;The proposed new tunnels would make it possible to go from the Las Vegas Convention Center to Mandalay Bay in just three minutes, as opposed to 30 minutes by surface roads during peak traffic hours, &lt;a href="https://www.lvloop.com/vegasloop"&gt;the company claims&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O55D4I"&gt;The plans, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/borings-vegas-loop-plans-reveal-2-separate-routes-envisioned-2218996/"&gt;first reported by the &lt;em&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were detailed in proposals submitted to Clark County officials on Monday. The Boring Company’s expansion push comes just days after the Las Vegas&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) finished &lt;a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/lvcva-deal-complete-with-las-vegas-monorail"&gt;buying the Las Vegas Monorail&lt;/a&gt;, which filed for bankruptcy in September after shutting down in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vna4kh"&gt;Following the acquisition, the LVCVA killed a noncompete agreement that had previously kept The Boring Company from digging any tunnels that served the same areas reached by the monorail. The monorail is not expected to reopen until at least May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HrukZu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Boring Company is still completing its first Tesla-powered people-mover in Las Vegas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJiQHF"&gt;The Boring Company is still working on making its first underground people-mover open to the public in Las Vegas, located underneath the Convention Center (which is owned by the LVCVA). While it was originally slated to open in January 2021 in time for the yearly Consumer Electronics Show, the trade show’s shift to a virtual event (and the pandemic in general) has muddied those plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4jD4Z"&gt;LVCVA president and CEO Steve Hill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257849/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-tunnel-finished-digging"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt; that they would likely wait until the next available trade show to open the so-called Convention Center Loop. On Tuesday, LVCVA senior vice president of communications Lori Nelson-Kraft confirmed that this is still the most likely plan, saying she’s “unsure at this time if we’ll open up the system prior to the first large show we have inside our building.” The Boring Company did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lRWdy"&gt;The Boring Company plans to shuttle up to 4,000 passengers per hour through its tunnels using Tesla Model 3s, Model Xs, and a “tram” built on the Model 3 platform that can fit between 12 and 16 people, Hill told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;back in May. While the goal is for those cars to eventually operate autonomously, they will have drivers at the outset. Hill said that the people mover will evolve to following a “conduit” and sensors being laid in the tunnels before actually driving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adW5sY"&gt;The LVCVA announced that first project with the Boring Company in 2019 and is paying Musk’s startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18636326/las-vegas-people-mover-lvcc-boring-company"&gt;$48.6 million&lt;/a&gt; to build the tunnels running under the convention center. Since it’s meant to be an amenity for convention-goers, Hill explained in May that he considered the full price tag of $52.5 million to be a sunk cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhkrti"&gt;But the expansion, if approved, will be funded differently. The Boring Company will pay for the cost of constructing the main tunnel of the new citywide loop, according &lt;a href="https://assets.simpleviewcms.com/simpleview/image/upload/v1/clients/lasvegas/2Posted_Agenda_Book_November_10_2020_BOD_7680b353-e24d-4e68-8668-7a5cd3afb018.pdf"&gt;to a presentation Hill gave in November&lt;/a&gt;, while casinos and other properties along the route that want a station will have to pay to have them built. The company will present its proposal in front of the Las Vegas City Council on Wednesday and before county officials in February. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let the dulcet tones of Google’s Blob Opera ring in the holiday season with machine learning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QhAwsEmAxIMKpoyBDlELXptzE9A=/101x0:1682x1054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518472/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_2.57.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ir2cb9"&gt;Hark! The blobs sing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3VFWD"&gt;Or at least, they do in Google’s latest machine learning experiment, &lt;a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/blob-opera/AAHWrq360NcGbw?cp=e30."&gt;the awe-inspiring Blob Opera&lt;/a&gt;, which will see a chorus of four adorable, colorful blobs serenade you with spine-tingling operatic music. Drag a blob up or down, and you’ll change what pitch they sing in; drag them from side to side, and you’ll change the vowel sound. Each blob will also harmonize with the others, in what can only be described as magical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhOy91"&gt;The Blob Opera just sounds &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, with soaring harmonies ringing out from each blob. Four actual opera singers — Christian Joel (tenor), Frederick Tong (bass), Joanna Gamble (mezzo‑soprano), and Olivia Doutney (soprano) — recorded 16 hours of singing (Ingunn Gyda Hrafnkelsdottir and John Holland-Avery also contributed), but it’s not their actual voices you’re hearing when the blobs sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOvINJ"&gt;Rather, the team trained a machine learning model on those voice recordings. The blobs are singing what the algorithm “thinks” opera sounds like, based on what it learned through the training. An additional model works to enable the harmonizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P06BjM"&gt;Created by &lt;a href="https://david.li"&gt;David Li&lt;/a&gt; working in collaboration with Google’s Arts and Culture team, the Blob Opera isn’t just a cute toy — it’s a great example of how machine learning can be levered to create something new and unexpected out of existing data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUTjQ4"&gt;The machine learning-based nature of the opera is why the blobs are limited to vowel sounds instead of actual words, but the random noises still manage to approximate the gist of a true opera, in spirit if not lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRXs"&gt;But the best part of the Blob Opera isn’t just the lovely harmonies or adorable characters — it’s the “holiday surprise” that’s activated by clicking the Christmas tree icons, which will give you the option to let the blobs sing any number of popular Christmas carols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrb2cR"&gt;Joy to the world, indeed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Surface Duo gets better TikTok support and availability outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hrg3xi3gfzvPDZjbGqBk-xV4hfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518392/akrales_191002_3704_0376.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igSwLe"&gt;Microsoft announced &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2020/12/15/the-year-ahead-for-surface-duo/"&gt;in a blog today&lt;/a&gt; that its dual screen phone, the Surface Duo, will be getting an “enhanced” TikTok app that takes advantage of its design. The company also announced the Duo will be available outside the US in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O169FZ"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;reviewed the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the hardware of the device, but had concerns with its modified Android software. The Duo was buggy at release and didn’t feature many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screen setup. The Surface Duo can run normal Android phone apps on either screen, but using the split-screen features Microsoft designed requires specific tailoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koHI8P"&gt;The group of apps that use Microsoft’s “postures” and multitasking features remains small, but TikTok is a major social media addition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8DhKXvfdOYJVSv6qqJse-0t8NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22172811/TikTok_SurfaceDuo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new TikTok experience on the Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rbiNaO"&gt;The company says that TikTok will use both of the Duo’s screens, allowing you to watch the “For You” feed on one screen, while browsing hashtags and searching for videos on the other. Microsoft highlighted the Spotify and Kindle apps when the Duo launched, but TikTok is one of the biggest apps to add full support since then. (Microsoft itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;attempted to purchase the company from ByteDance&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJOne"&gt;In addition to the new app, Microsoft says the Surface Duo will be available for purchase in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in early 2021. The company says they’ll have more to share “at the beginning of 2021,” so expect a more specific release date or maybe even an update on the Duo’s larger sibling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;the Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDrwC"&gt;The “enhanced” TikTok app should be available now for Duo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQeo1k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus is shipping the Quest 2 Elite Strap again and extending its warranty after quality issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2 with Elite Strap" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGWbFLwWGPDaqb5Isk-A41AGzmI=/320x0:3776x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518263/Quest_2_with_Elite_Strap_accessory.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v0SexV"&gt;Oculus is resuming shipments of its Quest 2 Elite Strap accessory and extending the warranty after reports of defective straps. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-pauses-quest-2-elite-strap-quality-reports/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier&lt;/a&gt;, the Facebook-owned virtual reality company paused Elite Strap shipments in November, saying a small number of users had reported them snapping after use. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-sales-resume-after-initial-quality-control-issues?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;it tells &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s pinpointed the issue as a “processing inconsistency with some early units,” and the product is going back on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcpNmk"&gt;Oculus maintains that the Elite Strap problems affect a “very small percentage” of customers. But it’s increasing the standard one-year warranty to a two-year period, during which Oculus will replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CZWe"&gt;The $49 Elite Strap (and a $129 version with an external battery and carrying case) replaces the standard cloth strap of the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21432628/oculus-quest-2-accessories-headstrap-usbc-fit-pack-price"&gt;a major upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that makes the $299 Quest 2 far more comfortable, and since it’s reappeared on the Oculus store and is being restocked elsewhere, it’s apparently a viable option once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yl9RpJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece has been updated to reflect the Elite Strap being restocked on the Oculus store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
