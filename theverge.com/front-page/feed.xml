    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bh591W"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors is &lt;a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-debuts-on-nasdaq-through-merger-with-churchill-capital-corp-iv"&gt;now a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, following the completion of a merger where it fetched an eye-watering $4.5 billion in fresh capital. Shares of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;Saudi-owned&lt;/a&gt;, California-based startup began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AZZBW"&gt;Lucid Motors will now turn its full attention back to an even taller task: getting its first electric car on the road, where it will face stiff competition in the luxury market from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The startup has said that it plans to start delivering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;extremely powerful but serenely luxurious&lt;/a&gt; Air sedan later this year, and it has already built more than 100 near-final quality versions at its new factory in Arizona. It has an electric SUV called Gravity in the works, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thd0wQ"&gt;The public listing is the second in the last week for the industry; fellow EV startup Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587530/faraday-future-nasdaq-ffie-spac-ipo-investors-funding"&gt;became a public company listed on the Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; last Thursday and raised $1 billion in the process. The two startups are just the latest in a growing line of EV startups, autonomous vehicle companies, and automotive suppliers to go public by merging with so-called special purpose acquisition companies, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt;, which are publicly listed investment vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pD2nB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lucid’s luxury sedan — the Air — is supposed to start shipping to customers this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4fMt2"&gt;Unlike many of those other startups, though, Lucid Motors has been around for a while. It was founded in 2007 as a battery company called Atieva. But &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/13/13268450/atieva-atvus-image-tesla-faraday-le-eco"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt; it set out to build an all-electric sedan of its own, and tapped Peter Rawlinson — the former lead engineer of the Model S program at Tesla — to head up the project. (Rawlinson would later become CEO.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDIrKr"&gt;Lucid Motors originally hoped to put the Air into production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;as early as 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But it ran into the same problem that nearly ended the journey for many of its peers: it didn’t have enough money. The startup had raised hundreds of millions of dollars to that point but needed billions, in part because it was also trying to build a factory to build the sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8s3IDq"&gt;Funding for electric vehicle startups was much harder to come by in 2016 and 2017, though, especially as some of them — like Faraday Future — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;began collapsing&lt;/a&gt; in remarkably public fashion. Making matters worse for Lucid Motors was the fact that Faraday Future founder Jia Yueting wound up owning some 30 percent of his rival’s shares. Jia’s ownership became a major problem for potential investors because of his reluctance to sell, as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEXWpH"&gt;Talks with investors and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;even automakers like Ford&lt;/a&gt; eventually fell apart, and Lucid Motors took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;loans from a hedge fund and a Chinese bus company to keep the lights on&lt;/a&gt;, using its intellectual property as collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUgUc"&gt;Lucid Motors then found a savior in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The two sides announced a $1 billion deal in September of that year, just a few weeks before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html"&gt;had &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jamal Khashoggi brutally murdered&lt;/a&gt;. That injection of cash, plus subsequent investments from the fund, have given Saudi Arabia majority ownership of Lucid Motors. (It was also a major participant in the funding round that took place alongside the SPAC merger, which is one reason for how Lucid Motors raised so much money in this transaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XIS80r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike some other EV startups, Lucid Motors has been around for a while&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgD1HS"&gt;Saudi Arabia proved to have deep enough pockets to help Lucid Motors fund its extremely expensive ambitions, while also finally buying out Jia’s stake, as filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show. In exchange, it got control of a startup that helps it paint bin Salman’s fantastic picture of making Saudi Arabia a futuristic and far less oil-dependent nation — while also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002"&gt;making a boatload of money in the process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ne3vsl"&gt;Lucid Motors started looking at merging with a SPAC to raise money in late 2020 and hired Citi to help with the process. How the startup came together with its eventual SPAC partner is still a matter of some debate, though. In January 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lucid Motors was in talks with a SPAC run by financier Michael Klein, who used to work for Citi and has ties to Saudi Arabia. But in filings with the SEC, Lucid Motors and Churchill Capital  IV (the SPAC) say that they had not held any talks before that article was published. In fact, they say that article was what brought the two sides together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjvnco"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;proposed merger was announced in February&lt;/a&gt; and in the months since became one of the most-traded SPACs in anticipation of the deal closing. But the merger was held up at the very last minute when, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588798/lucid-motors-churchill-capital-merger-cciv-lcid-merger-spac-delay"&gt;July 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, Lucid Motors and the SPAC had to publicly plead with shareholders to vote for a key term of the deal that hadn’t yet received enough votes. The reason? Many of those shareholders were new to the market and didn’t know about the vote, or if they did, there was a chance that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588798/lucid-motors-churchill-capital-merger-cciv-lcid-merger-spac-delay"&gt;information about the vote had gone to spam&lt;/a&gt;. Lucid Motors and the SPAC delayed for a day, and eventually received enough votes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health record company pays hospitals that use its algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Thu Jan 7, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbup5N94_ij-usHiEKa8Opt6wgo=/0x0:4867x3245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633862/1230464172.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erZCNm"&gt;The electronic health record company Epic offers financial incentives to healthcare systems that use its proprietary algorithms — and those algorithms can deliver inaccurate predictions, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/26/epic-hospital-algorithms-sepsis-investigation/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqXbdN"&gt;Epic is the largest electronic health record company in the United States, and it holds the health records for around 250 million people. The company has around 20 algorithms designed to predict things like how long a patient might stay in the hospital, which patients might become seriously ill, and which might develop a deadly condition called sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WqJV6"&gt;Like many other groups that build health algorithms, Epic doesn’t publicly share details of how the algorithms are built. Researchers at hospitals that use Epic are able to scrutinize the tools, but any investigations are challenging: they can’t disclose proprietary information and may worry about complicating their employer’s relationships with the company if they publish negative results, &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoWWih"&gt;The studies that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been done&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the algorithms show that they often don’t work as well as advertised. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545044/algorithm-hospital-sepsis-epic-prediction"&gt;One analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the sepsis algorithm, which Epic says works 76 percent of the time, found it was only right 63 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4qlsq"&gt;Despite the problems with the algorithms, Epic incentivizes hospitals to adopt them. The company’s “honor roll” program has awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars and, in some cases, nearly $1 million to healthcare systems that implement technical upgrades, including the algorithms. “It would be a terrible world where Epic is giving people a million dollars, and the end result is the patients’ health gets worse,” Glenn Cohen, director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard University, told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;. The financial incentives could create a conflict of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YvcVz"&gt;“Epic’s Honor Roll is a voluntary program which encourages the adoption of features that help save lives, increase data exchange, and improve satisfaction for patients, physicians, and health systems,” Epic said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnYBAu"&gt;Some healthcare systems with financial resources and robust information technology departments are able to analyze Epic’s off-the-shelf algorithms and adjust them to fit to their needs. Others, though, may not be able to examine the tools as closely. “The least sophisticated hospitals who don’t have the large data teams are also the ones for whom $1 million is likely to make the most difference,” Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk7oQz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsjbtZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is quietly pushing Congress to slow the shift to electric vehicles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zogXHCLC65yw5lczoXIhZdVhhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633784/akrales_180328_2351_0621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYMVto"&gt;The US is slowing moving toward adopting policies that would put more electric vehicles on the road, but for Toyota, it’s not slow enough. The Japanese automaker, which is the largest car company in the world, has been quietly lobbying policymakers in Washington, DC to resist the urge to transition to an all-electric future — partly because Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rD2kj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a top Toyota executive has met with congressional leaders behind closed doors in recent weeks to advocate against the Biden administration’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivize the shift to EVs. The executive, Chris Reynolds, has argued that hybrids, like the Toyota Prius, as well as hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles should also be in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oY0YDi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZQVvz"&gt;In addition, Toyota is also pushing back against EV-friendly policy through the auto industry’s main DC-based lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. The group, which represents the major car companies and their suppliers and is chaired by Reynolds, has been arguing against the Biden administration’s plan to adopt the so-called California compromise as its official position, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGrQsP"&gt;Last year, a group of car companies made a deal on tailpipe emissions with California, which had been seeking to set tougher rules than the US as a whole. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrVHeG"&gt;Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvPuiZ"&gt;Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roCEmu"&gt;But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted as much in this article from 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oq7ekF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota’s top executives, including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13yhcU"&gt;Toyota’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ves5zT"&gt;The company came under fire recently after it was revealed that it was &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/what-we-learned-from-the-first-major"&gt;the largest corporate donor to Republican lawmakers who objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of those politicians also dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. Toyota initially defended the contributions, &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/update-toyota-reverses-course-says"&gt;but then later said it would halt them&lt;/a&gt;. You know things are bad for the company when a Toyota spokesperson has to confirm to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker does indeed believe that climate change is real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlFTxu"&gt;Toyota’s argument that hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles should also be included in the conversation is not a bad one. Hybrid vehicles in particular are an important stepping stone to the wider adoption of EVs, especially as the charging infrastructure is still in its infancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aEwS7"&gt;But that argument might carry more weight if the automaker’s track record on fuel economy was actually, well, good. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report"&gt;According to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota has slipped in its ranking in fuel efficiency across its entire fleet, going from an industry leader to near the bottom with GM and Ford. This comes as the company has pushed the sale of huge gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, which tend to command a larger profit than smaller sedans and hatchbacks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech company anti-terrorism initiative will increase its focus on far-right groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIwehru3lHSDDwTre53AfEJTfTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633495/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaagcC"&gt;A cross-platform counterterrorism program will start targeting white supremacist and far-right militia material, flagging content for moderation on Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and several other services. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-tech-giants-target-manifestos-militias-database-2021-07-26/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported the news&lt;/a&gt; this morning in an interview with Nicholas Rasmussen, executive director of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdqMKe"&gt;GIFCT — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15875102/facebook-microsoft-twitter-youtube-global-internet-forum-counter-terrorism"&gt;launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt; by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube — maintains a database of terrorist content that helps member companies find it for review or removal. That database initially included material from a United Nations-designated list of sanctioned groups, which meant it focused heavily on Islamist extremist organizations like the Taliban and Islamic State, with exceptions around specific far-right incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Ze7"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; outlines, GIFCT is expanding the list to include material identified by the UN Tech Against Terrorism initiative and the Five Eyes international intelligence partnership. That means adding content from groups like neo-Nazi organizations, the Three Percenters militia, and the Proud Boys, which was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/02/992846086/proud-boys-named-terrorist-entity-in-canada"&gt;designated a terrorist entity&lt;/a&gt; by Canada in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IgkIqX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GIFCT’s database helps Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms flag content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BebqLZ"&gt;The initial GIFCT database included hashed identifiers for images and video, and a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that GIFCT will add three categories of content over the coming months: PDFs of terrorist or violent extremist attackers, terrorist publications that use specific branding and logos, and URLs that are often shared on social networks. Platforms that can access the database — like Reddit, Snapchat, Microsoft’s LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Dropbox — will use the database to make moderation decisions according to their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj6uzl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/gifct-erin-saltman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; offers more detail&lt;/a&gt; on what’s being added, describing the expansion as “modest.” In an interview, GIFCT director of programming Erin Saltman says the group is attempting to avoid “scope creep” and will not include all content from loosely organized groups like &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/27/the-boogaloo-movement-is-not-what-you-think/"&gt;the Boogaloo movement&lt;/a&gt; or QAnon — although if a member commits a violent extremist attack, material like a killer’s manifesto might be banned. “There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship, especially when there are such close ties to politics,” says Saltman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dI1mF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3piFlc"&gt;GIFCT is expanding its list as national governments are taking a closer look at far-right terrorism. The US does not designate domestic terror groups the way it does foreign organizations, but President Joe Biden’s administration has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-donald-trump-joe-biden-business-race-and-ethnicity-84a84878e61009485af6b3542bfbb69a"&gt;pushed for a crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on homegrown extremism, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/three-percenter-capitol-riot.html"&gt;alleged Three Percenters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/19/979304432/4-proud-boys-charged-with-conspiracy-over-jan-6-capitol-riot"&gt;Proud Boys members&lt;/a&gt; were charged with participating in the January 6th riot at the US capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWI2mT"&gt;Saltman notes that companies are wary of GIFCT going beyond existing lists of terrorist groups out of fear it could undermine the credibility of the list. “Even at the UN level, you could not have an agreed-upon definition of terrorism, although they do still have frameworks and designation lists. We’re seeing companies being held to the same standard or above, being asked to go above and beyond what governments are able to do, which makes companies a little wary to be that powerful gatekeeper,” she says. Rasmussen also expressed wariness of over-moderation, saying that “over-achievement in this takes you in the direction of violating someone’s rights on the internet to engage in free expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PpkqH6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always interested in the future — so this week, we’re taking a look at the people who will live there. All week, we’re going to publish stories focused on young people, whether they’re pushing for immigration reform or making bank in the online vintage trade. The way we see it, they’re building the future, and they’re using technology to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ2Jo"&gt;We’re calling the series Next Gen, like a next-gen camera or phone. The hope is that human beings will get a little better each time around, with fewer of the hang-ups that plagued earlier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tw4gT"&gt;To kick it off, we’re going to hear from some of those young people firsthand. In a series of four personal essays, we asked young writers to talk about the tech that’s made the biggest impact on their lives, from YouTube videos to multiplayer gaming rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwaD4N"&gt;By the end of the week, you should have a pretty good sense of what the younger generations are up to — and what kind of future they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are $179 in-store at Staples through the rest of July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO7oHSR_IYqNGPb2bEMYZMaxoks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632701/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6mOlzf"&gt;Staples is hosting some stellar back-to-school deals this week, especially if tech is on your checklist. &lt;a href="https://www.staplesconnect.com/weeklyad"&gt;The AirPods Pro are $179&lt;/a&gt; (visible on the third page of the ad) and are available at this price in-store only. Originally $249, these have been falling in price, but it’s not often that they sell for less than $189. It’s worth mentioning that Staples is also offering &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-homepod-mini-my5g2ll-a-bluetooth-speaker-space-gray%2Fproduct_24490472%3FcmArea%3DCIRCULAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini for $89&lt;/a&gt;, which ties for the lowest price yet. Unlike the AirPods Pro, Staples is offering this miniature smart speaker in-store or online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJdyMF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613508"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw4_3VG4v2GjDGnC1mF-JdVVSGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13357959/newpencil.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdv4sj"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15182548-apple-pencil-2nd-generation-new-99-at-best-buy?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SlickdealsnetFP+%28Slickdeals+Frontpage%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation Apple Pencil that’s compatible with iPads that have a USB-C port is $99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747302599779291212" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (delivery at Amazon currently delayed to August 12th). This is $30 lower than its usual price, and students who want to take notes during class should hop on this deal. Compared to the first-generation Apple Pencil that clumsily recharges via an iPad’s Lightning port, this one magnetically attaches to the side of your iPad to power up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="stPQSS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s offering deals on many of its accessories, including screen protectors, cases, Bluetooth keyboard cases, and USB-C hubs. You can shop on Brydge’s site or Amazon for the deals. Here are the most appealing offers so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bTgbvG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XWRPVHD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s 10.2 Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a wireless keyboard with a spacious trackpad made for the seventh and eighth-generation iPad, costs $100 (usually $130) at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it in Sam Byford’s review of the larger 12.9-inch version made for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is unfortunately not discounted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="skYMEI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad-Bluetooth/dp/B0865JB97F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Brydge 11 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a wireless keyboard with a trackpad made for the iPad Pro (11-inch), costs $120 at Amazon (usually $150). The model that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad-Bluetooth/dp/B0865KQ772/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can fit a 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $140&lt;/a&gt; (usually $170).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GouDWhSa_xi55ApMZOW0mqH9_fI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21788157/dseifert_200819_4156_0008.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="B1iM3Q"&gt;The Brydge 10.5 Go Plus, a wireless keyboard with a trackpad that’s made for the Microsoft Surface Go and Go 2, costs $100 at Amazon. It’s usually $140. The bigger &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Precision-Compatible-Microsoft/dp/B08CWTKZQV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.3 Pro Plus made for the Surface Pro 4-7 models is $130&lt;/a&gt;, down from $150 at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377083/brydge-12-3-pro-10-5-go-plus-surface-keyboard-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the 10.5 Go Plus and 12.3 Pro Plus in Dan Seifert’s review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zh4BTx"&gt;Anker is offering a solid deal on its 20W Nano USB-C wall charger that includes a six-foot Lightning to USB-C cable. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P544KWF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get the two together for $24&lt;/a&gt;, down from $30. Considering that Apple’s similarly powerful 20W charger costs $19 by itself and doesn’t include a fast-charging cable, this bundle stands out as a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iR94Gy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10669653" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Parsec</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thRznQRmo7Rh_6hL0sJ0954sHZ8=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632644/VRG_4679_Parsec_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new tool for an older kind of gaming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9r1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1BzlFi"&gt;In my corner of the Bronx, March 2020 felt like the end of the world. A statewide emergency was declared on March 7th, and the city went into lockdown 13 days later, as case numbers climbed higher each day. Before lockdown, I’d been going to an esports venue nearly twice a week to play in Super Smash Bros. tournaments, but that quickly dropped out of my routine. I had just gotten a library card, too, to make more time for reading. Now the card was useless, and trips outdoors became rare. As soon as I had laid out a plan for getting productive, the world pushed me back inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dKxrM"&gt;Being stuck inside wasn’t as bad for my social life as you might think. I spent more time on Discord, seeking out new channels and new people. Some of them were streamers, others voice actors — all of them people I would have been unlikely to meet offline. Some of them became my closest friends, which made me even more anxious to find new ways to connect and spend time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kG9nPl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxxoF"&gt;Eventually, my friends from college introduced me to &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;. In simple terms, Parsec is an application that lets you screen-share your PC to anyone you wish. By creating a link to your Parsec, you can let another Parsec user see your screen and interact with it, a step beyond the basic screen shares in apps like Zoom and Discord. Linked Parsec users can even connect keyboards or controllers virtually to the host system and the app will treat them like locally connected peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4TGBE"&gt;Put it all together and it becomes a new way to play games online. A lot of games from older systems like the GameCube and Wii didn’t have online functionality, but they have local multiplayer built in. Combine Parsec with an emulator like Dolphin and a whole new world of console games opens up — games I’d never been able to play with someone who wasn’t in the same room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2m4h0B"&gt;We started out with Mario Party, which led to some hilarious moments. (You’ve never seen a player truly break until you’ve seen all of their earnings being given to someone else through Chance Time.) We played the older generation of Super Smash Bros. games, too, before moving on to Mario Kart: Double Dash and GoldenEye. Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games, providing raw, harmless fun without an overburdened story or gestures at real-world relevance. So many rivalries were born, and so many friendships were tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PNP6e8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="369Vcr"&gt;I usually played with friends from college, and those games became some of the best memories I’ve shared with them. I had known most of them for more than a year, so we already had a good rapport, and a sense of just how much smack talk we could get past each other. We kept a Discord channel open while we played, solely for the purpose of throwing jabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCca5"&gt;Parsec’s biggest limitation is that it requires both the host and the remote user to have strong internet connections. If either one is out of whack, then it can cause lag on that side of the game. Lag on the host side is particularly bad since it causes downstream problems for everyone in the session. (I highly recommend connecting an ethernet cable to the system you’re using since a little lag can create a lot of embarrassment.) Since I had a wired connection, I would usually end up hosting. But occasional issues on my end still caused a whole game to stutter. Still, that’s the only real problem with Parsec, and it’s more of a general cloud-gaming problem than a specific issue with the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCxpAr"&gt;Parsec is a one-track app, aimed at serving a simple purpose: remote multiplayer gaming. In some ways, it’s a simple problem to solve, but solving it well gave me a lot of happiness during what was otherwise a very hard year. Whenever I wasn’t working on writing or trawling the internet for content to watch, I would end up booting up a game and trying to get a Parsec session going. It happened nearly every day. When I think of my favorite moments from 2020, a lot of them were routed through Parsec, playing an older generation of games with newfound friends — and feeling, if only for a moment, that we were all in one room together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t6e1CQ"&gt;Life is weird: one minute I’m dancing in a concert mosh pit, happily crammed among strangers like a sardine in a can, and then &lt;em&gt;bam&lt;/em&gt; — pandemic. The can tilts, the music stops, and I’m flopping around without the thrill and connection of live music at a packed venue, my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqFjXK"&gt;But since lockdown, I’ve managed to find one important substitute: NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rGF9I"&gt;Tiny Desk concerts are exactly what they sound like: an artist performs while residing behind, well, a rather tiny desk. The series has been running since 2008, starting with indie acts like Dr. Dog and the Avett Brothers, and moving to huge names like Taylor Swift and Megan Thee Stallion in recent years. The setting is casual, the performance is laid-back — it can be as basic as an artist and an instrument — and the songs are often stripped to their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="9oJ6Jk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9I23gU"&gt;Big deal, right? Actually, I’m so glad you asked. It’s a huge deal, even if it doesn’t seem like much at first glance. Though I appreciate the in-your-face experience of a concert (it’s hard to forget your boyfriend dragging you from a mosh pit after getting hit in the face), the magic of Tiny Desk is in its simplicity. It’s just music and people in a room, a pairing very much missed for the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWdqY0"&gt;Many of my favorite Tiny Desk concerts were released toward the beginning of the pandemic. There’s King Princess’ gentle serenade, and Harry Styles’ playful laughter as he cracks jokes with the audience — two videos that fill me with an incomparable warmth, time and time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4of1f"&gt;But the one that’s stuck with me for the longest time is a performance by Alicia Keys. Recorded in February of 2020 and published the following June, the video begins with Keys telling the audience that she “just wanted to vibe out” with them. And vibe out she does. Everything about this performance — from her invitation for the audience to join her as she sings, to her unwavering smile as she plays along with her band — is exactly what music is about: coexisting with the ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sU62FW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwUt1fVLb3E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BtrZCM"&gt;As she plays the introductory chords to her song “Show Me Love,” Keys speaks about needing love “more than ever before” because “that’s really what links us.” I remember getting chills despite the unbearable summer heat, thinking how heart-wrenching it was that her call for unity had been recorded a month before the world went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXnaLM"&gt;I think that’s what I cherish most about this performance. It was uploaded during a time when the world was in desperate need of love, and Alicia Keys gave me an awful lot to cling to. It wasn’t just the wisdom and mindfulness she demonstrated through the duration of the show, but the way she poured her soul into the music and how she embraced the audience before her, praising them for their voices, offering everyone in the room — the audience, her band — a collective sense of belonging and purpose. The natural chemistry between the individuals in that room made me forget about the drudgery I had been stuck on and instead consider the value of human connection that I once took for granted. Even through a screen, music can connect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWSF3Y"&gt;As I’ve watched the world revert to something resembling the normalcy of life before the year 2020, the Alicia Keys Tiny Desk concert has remained a consistent source of comfort that I’ve often turned to. It’s been the accompaniment to my happiest and saddest days, but each time, it has been exactly what I need: a gentle reminder that life is not everlasting but we will always have these humbling tidbits of humanity. This Tiny Desk concert is my treasured digital artifact. It’s my reminder that music is boundless, and that despite the ever-changing world we exist in, it is the universal constant — the one thing that helps us make sense of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aTvank"&gt;And if nothing else, Tiny Desk confirmed that “Fallin’” is a damn masterpiece. It’s not mosh-pit material, but I would still do anything to be a sardine in that crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: the half-finished Duolingo course</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I am tormented by the specter of Duo the Owl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3jw7V5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YG0jg0"&gt;I heard the notification whistle and reached for my phone instinctively. I was met with a bright screen and an ominous message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7BW7"&gt;“Hey Jamal, we’ve missed you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WI0zDo"&gt;Instead of coming from a friend or concerned neighbor, the message came from language-learning app Duolingo. Once again, I had abandoned a Spanish course, and Duo the Owl had popped up in my notifications to remind me just how frequently I failed to complete a course on the app. It became a kind of routine: leaving a course half-finished and then watching the anxiety pile up with each notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8XFmTI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrEb4W"&gt;I was drawn to Duolingo as a way to improve my Spanish, which had never quite clicked during college. The warp speed of university life often left me with little to no time on my hands, and languages had never been my strong suit. In my courses, I was forced to adapt to the timelines of a semester, and even when I did perform up to par, it felt like it was more about grades than actual knowledge. Duolingo seemed like a good way to break out of that trap and get comfortable with the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYDQwq"&gt;Part of my anxiety comes from the vulnerability I feel when testing out a new language. There’s always a period of confusion when starting something new, but I’m usually able to fake my way through it, pretending to have the skills for long enough to actually pick them up. Language isn’t like that. You can’t fake a transitive verb. When you don’t know something — when &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don’t know something — the error is inescapable. My friends were often available to help me out, but the threat of embarrassment made me too anxious to take them up on it. When I studied alone, I spent hours perfecting one word or syllable and having imaginary conversations that never bore witness because of my trepidation. The fear of failing stopped me from trying in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUOBU7"&gt;Without realizing it, I had turned Duolingo from a hobby into a place of hyper-evaluation. If it took me longer than a week to get comfortable with a grammar or vocabulary lesson, I started to see it as impossible. I had internalized the belief that learning was meant to come innately. If I wasn’t picking up Spanish immediately, I figured my brain just wasn’t built to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="paF8yx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t fake a transitive verb&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKcgHW"&gt;As it turns out, I’m not the only one who falls into this trap. Duolingo doesn’t release completion rates for its courses, but &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/us-language-report-2020/#uslearnersrank68thforhardestworkinglearnersbasedontheaveragenumberoflessonscompleted"&gt;a report last year&lt;/a&gt; said American users ranked 68th out of all countries in the number of lessons completed. A separate &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/39925566/Percentage-of-people-who-finished-a-course"&gt;informal study&lt;/a&gt; put the overall completion rate for Spanish at less than 0.01 percent. Far more people are getting stuck halfway through than are finishing lessons — so maybe my half-finished lessons weren’t quite as embarrassing as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDandG"&gt;Naturally, Duolingo thinks a lot about user retention. I spoke with Cindy Blanco, a senior language scientist at Duolingo, and she stressed that the courses aren’t intended to be one-size-fits-all. People come to Duolingo with different goals, and they may end up ditching the course once they’ve reached the level they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd5Qom"&gt;“If you think, ‘Well, I want to go to Portugal and feel comfortable ordering in a restaurant,’ how much of the course do I need to work on so I could feel good about that experience?” she told me. “For other people it’s like, ‘Well, I really love K-pop and I want to understand the culture or read more about the bands in their own language.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXhSd7"&gt;That distinction extends to Duo the Owl, who had tormented me over my unfinished Spanish lessons. Blanco told me that the owl is designed to send different messages depending on culture and geography. In that sense, the app is focused on delivering a user experience that feels unique, even when it’s trying to rope a dormant user back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2QpRk"&gt;Since my conversation with Cindy, I’ve begun to dig back into my Spanish lessons. But I’ve also started to think about my unfinished courses in a different way. Learning isn’t always linear. It may take a while before I get comfortable with Spanish. In fact, it may never happen at all. Once I had let go of that insistence on perfection, I started to feel much better about dipping into the occasional Spanish lesson — and much less shaken when I see an unexpected notification from a cartoon owl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Wattpad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ERFfDnZgDBMX-EWANu9UO8qAto=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632615/VRG_4679_Wattpad_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking beyond my local library, I found a new way to think about writing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KrmueU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="S1aWzP"&gt;I started reading early, and I spent my childhood hungry for stories. For the first half of my life, I was sustained by my small public library, finding solace in old, ratty copies of Lemony Snicket’s &lt;em&gt;A Series of Unfortunate Events &lt;/em&gt;and Louisa May Alcott’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women.&lt;/em&gt; It wasn’t until I was 14 that I felt the limits of my library’s bookshelves and started to look online for new, brave, curious protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPZswi"&gt;That’s when I stumbled onto Wattpad. When I found it in 2012, the site functioned as a microcosm of teen popular culture, reflecting the platform’s large contingent of Gen Z and millennial users. Every scroll, regardless of genre, brought users book covers largely adorned with Photoshop edits of notable teenage heartthrobs of the time (think: Dylan O’Brien in his &lt;em&gt;Teen Wolf &lt;/em&gt;fame, or a younger, long-haired One Direction Harry Styles). Some stories even included popular song recommendations (mostly Taylor Swift) and a cast filled with A-list celebrities, in the hopes of creating an immersive experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WdCEDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="St8FbU"&gt;Founded in 2006, Wattpad has grown far beyond the scale of my local library. The platform currently boasts 94 million users and more than a billion uploaded stories, ranging from historical tales to outright fanfiction. In its 15 years of existence, Wattpad stories have gained a reputation in the online literary community — a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;landfill of self-insert fanfiction to some, and a treasure trove of hidden gems to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvNN3"&gt;As a 14-year-old, I found Wattpad’s saturation of teen popular culture exhilarating; it promised to appease my quickly shifting reading preferences. My digital library became a hoard of historical fiction and supernatural romance novels, where I surrendered to my teenage angst and lived vicariously through questionably written characters. For four years, I religiously followed the satirical but romantic &lt;em&gt;Storm and Silence &lt;/em&gt;series, treating the Wednesday chapter uploads like morning church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pL5FbF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A nexus where the personal and professional came together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zUS5QF"&gt;I was amazed by Wattpad, not only for its riveting content, but also for its ability to shatter many traditional barriers and expectations for writing. For one, authors seemed to balance their professional and personal personas on the platform, retaining sometimes thousands of readers under pen names like “dontstealmypoptarts” or “iheartonedirection.” Where I had previously only viewed authors as elusive and mysterious, these usernames instead suggested that anyone could write a book — even people who liked Pop-Tarts and One Direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYWusr"&gt;I also loved how authors often addressed their readership directly. They would spotlight a reader of the week, offer bonus chapters, and communicate any changes to their uploading schedule. Chapters contained author’s notes, a nexus where the personal and professional came together. Sometimes there was a note about upcoming exams, at other times a tragic comment about a pet’s passing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c79YkZ"&gt;Readers also bridged the divide, offering words of encouragement or criticism. They would share their excitement, amusement, or worry in a chapter’s comment section, and interact with other users in the comments. Readers and writers developed a collaborative relationship and a sense of community, as writers are able to refine their stories with this feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HNVGA"&gt;In 2014, I began to publish my own poems and books on the platform. My poems spoke about love and betrayals that I had not yet experienced. My books were enemies-to-lovers romance novels with bad dialogue that my 16-year-old self mistook for wit. A few of my books were ranked by the website’s popularity algorithm in broad categories, but most remained largely untouched by readers. Still, I kept writing for the joy of it. Eight years later, those pieces are like a time capsule of my teenage self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmxVvT"&gt;Wattpad has changed drastically since 2012. Book publishers have started to take notice, and the company has rolled out professionalizing features like content from established writers (“Tap Originals”) and pay-to-access works (“Paid Stories”). In January, Wattpad was acquired by a South Korean tech conglomerate, Naver Corporation, for $600 million. Like any online community, Wattpad writers are hostage to the profitability of their platform. The introduction of Wattpad coins, in particular, threatens to isolate or separate readers who aren’t able to buy them and access these new Paid Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDV8pQ"&gt;As someone who joined the website for its expansive, accessible, and free content, I have mixed feelings about the new features and the emphasis on monetization. It’s a familiar turn for tech platforms, and while it’s alarming, it’s better than the site shutting down entirely. As a retired Wattpad user, I can’t help but feel nostalgic for all the time I’ve spent on the platform. I hope it can survive for all the 14-year-olds still looking for a bigger library, as a space where individuals can read, write, and form community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="muw28g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this piece stated Wattpad’s total uploads as 665 million, citing outdated numbers from a 2019 report. The current total is over 1 billion; &lt;/em&gt;The Verge &lt;em&gt;regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
