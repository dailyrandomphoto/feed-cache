    <title>Facebook bans developer behind Unfollow Everything tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1GiZY-WJjRrbuVLGrJjJK2JKAQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968061/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBjNqF"&gt;A developer who made a tool that let people automatically unfollow friends and groups on Facebook says he’s been banned permanently from the social networking site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTvE90"&gt;Louis Barclay was the creator of “Unfollow Everything,” a browser extension that allowed Facebook users to essentially delete their News Feed by unfollowing all their connections at once. Facebook allows users to individually unfollow friends, groups, and pages, which removes their content from the News Feed, the algorithmically-controlled heart of Facebook. Barclay’s tool automated this process, instantly wiping users’ News Feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdR9xS"&gt;As Barclay wrote of his experience using the tool in a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/facebook-unfollow-everything-cease-desist.html"&gt;recent article for &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pMzZ0P"&gt;I still remember the feeling of unfollowing everything for the first time. It was near-miraculous. I had lost nothing, since I could still see my favorite friends and groups by going to them directly. But I had gained a staggering amount of control. I was no longer tempted to scroll down an infinite feed of content. The time I spent on Facebook decreased dramatically. Overnight, my Facebook addiction became manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3zMT"&gt;In response, Facebook sent Barclay a &lt;a href="https://louisbarclay.notion.site/Unfollow-Everything-cease-and-desist-letter-from-Facebook-ea219169421b457bb7ce010b7bf9ce1f"&gt;cease-and-desist letter&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, saying he’d violated the site’s terms of service by creating software that automated user interactions. Barclay says the company then “permanently disabled my Facebook and Instagram accounts” and “demanded that I agree to never again create tools that interact with Facebook or its other services.” Barclay notes that in addition to helping users, his “Unfollow Everything” tool was being used by researchers at the Swiss University of Neuchâtel to study the effects of the News Feed on people’s happiness. He says he couldn’t risk tangling in court with a trillion-dollar company like Facebook and so simply removed the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66HVPl"&gt;Barclay’s story has emerged at an inauspicious time for Facebook (though when is it a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time for the perpetually-embattled firm?). Whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;appeared before Congress&lt;/a&gt; this week to testify about Facebook’s insatiable demand for growth, which Haugen says comes too often at the costs of users’ well-being. “It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” she said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;episode of &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Documents leaked by Haugen include internal research conducted by Facebook that shows how using Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;exacerbates body issues and mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; for some teenagers. Facebook’s primary response to Haugen’s testimony has been to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;smear her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJr8HH"&gt;Compared to Haugen’s exposure of Facebook, Barclay’s story is relatively run-of-the-mill. After all, Facebook’s terms of service are very clear on what sort of tools users can build, and Unfollow Everything obviously violated this agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIAidN"&gt;But the episode still neatly illustrates Facebook’s approach to its user-base, and how it often wants to give people the feeling of control without letting them fully escape its grasp. The company is happy to let users unfollow people individually, but automating the process would make it too easy to opt-out of the News Feed, which is essential for keeping users coming back and lining Facebook’s pockets with advertising revenue. So, of course, tools like Barclay’s — even if they have limited uptake — are forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Zev2R"&gt;We’ve contacted Facebook about this story and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is coming to LG’s recent smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cichmddOWapAc67TELpqQeoWkJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967935/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3y8Sbl"&gt;TikTok has launched an app for LG’s 2020 and 2021 smart TVs, the TV manufacturer has announced. The app arrived on these recent webOS 5.0 and webOS 6.0 models with a firmware update that started rolling out on October 7th, but will also be coming to older 2019 TVs “in the coming months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFFOtm"&gt;The app is launching in the UK, France, and Germany, a TikTok representative confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That’s notable since TikTok’s smart TV apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;Samsung TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt; have all focused on those same European countries so far. Meanwhile in the US, TikTok released a more limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” app&lt;/a&gt; on Fire TV devices last year. We have followed up with both LG and TikTok to ask which regions the new smart TV app will be available in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tomwXf"&gt;Considering how optimized TikTok is for portrait-orientated mobile viewing, it’s not going to look great on living room televisions. But TikTok is understood to be trying to reach a broader audience with its smart TV apps, as well as to tap into the higher advertising rates associated with TV viewing, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/hire-reskill-or-upskill-a-guide-to-smarter-skill-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkHE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 5:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with confirmed regions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Search adds guitar tuner to its smorgasbord of built-in features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjRpA6VKypAoobgoYzGOIW4Ifh0=/0x0:661x441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967931/xD2C8Qsdpb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You play a note, and the software tells you whether you’re in tune.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aWmrb"&gt;Google Search now has a handy built-in tuner, letting you use the microphone on your phone or computer to tune a guitar, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-search-has-an-instrument-tuner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. To access the feature, which was added this week, just search for “&lt;a href="https://g.co/kgs/qjLuJT"&gt;Google tuner&lt;/a&gt;.” The interface is similar to the dozens of guitar tuning apps that are already available. You play a string on the guitar, and Google will detect the note you’re aiming for, and tell you to “tune up” or “tune down” as required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ7QJP"&gt;Like other guitar tuning apps, the effectiveness of Google’s tuner seems to depend a lot on the hardware you’re using it with. My iPhone 12 Pro (via Safari) or Windows desktop with a Blue Snowball USB microphone (via Edge) had no trouble hearing and helping me tune an unamplified electric guitar, but a more affordable Android device I’m currently reviewing (with Chrome) couldn’t pick it up at all. Your mileage may vary, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpKSVFR_7Am1wHRMaTxhXum1OeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909685/IMG_1534.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8rphDVZZhcvMhXFfaeVr0QOdtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909684/IMG_1533.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XAWZjX"&gt;Like most other guitar tuner apps, I don’t think Google Search’s feature is going to kill off the market for dedicated hardware tuners from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.korg.com/uk/products/tuners/ca_1/index.php"&gt;Korg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.boss.info/uk/products/tu-3/"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;. It’s too reliant on the quality of the mic in your device, and there’s no way to easily plug in an electric guitar to avoid having to worry about background noise. But if you need to tune up in a pinch, Google Search now has you covered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OLED Nintendo Switch doesn’t have a Pentile screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RXT95KwiEb_Qu9C1Iqg2_-V2oP0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967929/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6gOPi"&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED Model doesn’t have a Pentile screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIRMXb"&gt;That might not mean much to you, and it wasn’t something we were able to confirm definitively during our review process — other than to say that the screen is a huge improvement. Which it is. But there’s been speculation ever since the OLED Switch was announced that its panel might use Pentile technology, which could have had big implications for image quality. Nintendo devices don’t tend to have the best screens, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct3roe"&gt;Pentile is a trademark owned by Samsung that refers to various subpixel matrix layouts most commonly used in OLED display panels. In casual conversation, or as casual as conversations about OLED subpixel layouts can really be, Pentile is now essentially shorthand for “not full RGB,” meaning that red, green, and blue subpixels are shared between pixels rather than each pixel having all three colors itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QwAIdM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d1rPz5"&gt;Almost all OLED screens in portable consumer devices use some form of Pentile subpixel layout these days. The benefit of Pentile displays is that they’re cheaper to produce and can last longer. The downside is that they’re functionally lower resolution than an equivalent screen with an RGB stripe, which means you can sometimes see artifacts like dithering and graininess, particularly in high-contrast situations like reading text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRIwGi"&gt;The effect lessens as pixel density increases. Personally, Pentile stopped bothering me on phones when 1080p OLED displays became commonplace, which is to say that I didn’t like the Galaxy S III’s panel but was fine with the Galaxy S4. A 7-inch 720p Pentile screen on a Switch, then, would probably have been an problem. And Nintendo is not known for securing the best screen technologies for its devices — witness the 3DS, where some models randomly came with much better IPS screens than the regular TN LCD panels, with no indication as to which you’d get until you opened the box — so there was reasonable cause for concern over the Switch OLED Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQE7mz"&gt;Well, turns out there’s no need to worry. My personal OLED Switch preorder just arrived, so of course the first thing I did with it was take a macro photo. Here’s what the screen looks like up close:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLqZn_tqro3VqIFYk6Yr1l3w9LQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909635/IMG20211008145132_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A macro photo of the OLED Switch’s display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HG0FfF"&gt;This is a white area of the screen, so all the subpixels are lit up. The layout is actually a little unusual, with columns of blue subpixels next to smaller, alternating red and green ones rather than arranging them in uniform RGB lines. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/10896/the-apple-watch-series-2-review/3"&gt;The Apple Watch does something similar&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m not sure what the advantages of this layout are — it presumably relates to the relative efficiency of each color. But what matters is that as you can see, each and every individual pixel is made up of a single red, green, and blue subpixel, or in other words you’re looking at a full RGB display with the same resolution for all three colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWdV74"&gt;For comparison, here’s the iPhone 13 Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SsOz-jbv-GG2Phre_pUOKLJo6H8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909650/IMG20211008152015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A macro photo of the iPhone 13 Pro’s display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5OYYGV"&gt;You can see how the subpixels are arranged in a complex diamond layout, alternating blue and green on one line and red and green on the next. On displays like this, each pixel is comprised of fewer subpixels compared to LCDs and RGB OLEDs that reserve three specific subpixels for each pixel in the screen — the “green resolution” is actually higher than the other two colors. As I said before, it’s not really an issue on devices with such sharp panels, but the image quality can break down when pixels are visible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ALMDS"&gt;It’s not necessarily a big surprise that the new Switch went with RGB — the original PS Vita had an RGB-stripe OLED display ten years ago — but you never know with Nintendo. There just aren’t that many 720p OLED displays of this size these days, or RGB OLED displays in general, so it was certainly an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ra32WY"&gt;Anyway, glad to clear that up. Now I’m off to play &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SVP of Android offers open invitation to help Apple put RCS texting on the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The Samsung Electronics Co. Unpacked Product Launch Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eQL9Bb5kUymvqQoti8MsQwG4MQ=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967396/1200178032.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlGXtY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953"&gt;tweet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer called on Apple to support RCS, the next-generation texting standard that’s supposed to supplant SMS. He offered an “open invitation to the folks who can make this right” and said “we are here to help.” Translation: the “folks” are Apple and “we are here to help” is Google’s offer to assist Apple in implementing the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefiaP"&gt;RCS is finally starting to gain traction around the world. Its biggest champion has been Google, which finally landed on using it as the default texting solution for Android phones after trying every other solution. RCS is far from perfect, but it’s clearly superior to SMS (which is, of course, a low bar). After securing deals from US carriers to commit to the standard in the next year, Google is setting its sights on a new target for evangelism: Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k633wL"&gt;Apple has yet to reply with comment to any inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over several years on whether it intends to support RCS on the iPhone, and declined to comment on this story. It seems unlikely that RCS is coming to iOS anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXREhk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Group chats don't need to break this way. There exists a Really Clear Solution. Here's an open invitation to the folks who can make this right: we are here to help.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0"&gt;https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60ao87"&gt;Lockheimer’s tweet followed a cheeky chain of tweets that started with a &lt;a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/bryson-dechambeau-iphone-ryder-cup-grouptext?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=golfdigest"&gt;story about how pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau was breaking iMessage group chats with his green bubbles&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1446182495846912006"&gt;official Android account cringingly&lt;/a&gt; drawing a parallel between green bubbles and the &lt;a href="https://www.golfmonthly.com/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753"&gt;famous Masters green jacket&lt;/a&gt;. Lockheimer jokes that there is a “Really Clear Solution” (RCS) to group chats not breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKQVLi"&gt;RCS has had a long, convoluted (and unfinished) slog towards becoming the default texting experience on Android. Beginning in March 2021, Google began securing deals from US carriers to get them to commit to using Google’s Android Messages app as the default on all Android phones sold on their networks. It started with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;blockbuster deal with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, followed later by smaller deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. Once all those deals are implemented, Android users who text each other will switch over to RCS, which supports typing indicators, better group chats, and bigger multimedia messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV52C7"&gt;Importantly, RCS on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;Android Messages also supports end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats&lt;/a&gt;. That will mean Android users texting each other will have a higher level of privacy and security than when they text iPhone users — and vice versa. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713543/syniverse-hack-five-years-text-messages"&gt;recent hack on SMS company Syniverse&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example of why encryption is important in messaging — especially for the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwXfhp"&gt;RCS has problems of its own, though. As with iMessage, it’s possible for messages to get lost in limbo when switching phones. It’s also a standard that is championed by Google but theoretically agreed upon by carriers around the world. The association with Google has tainted RCS in the eyes of many, and of course requiring carriers to agree on anything is a recipe for problems. There are also technical limitations, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;Ron Amadeo explains here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvu6A5"&gt;Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that RCS will replace SMS eventually — but only if Apple decides to support it. As more carriers adopt it and as more users realize that SMS is inherently less secure, Apple could begin to feel enough pressure to adopt RCS. Thus far, however, it hasn’t shown any signs of that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGiguxru9rzApZKuJIVKuBLCoGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967245/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California just made it a lot harder for companies to cover up harassment and abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gov. Gavin Newsom School Visit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWwBOsB4DtGhshUdVYoUxv5duU4=/0x117:4770x3297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967179/1340672342.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/East Bay Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7QrLr"&gt;California governor Gavin Newsom signed the &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331"&gt;Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night— a historic piece of legislation, authored by state senator Connie Leyva (D-Chino), that should protect workers who speak out about harassment and discrimination even if they’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZO2G"&gt;Pinterest whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma began &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;pushing the bill forward last year&lt;/a&gt;, after coming forward with allegations of racism against the tech company. She knew she was partially protected by the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, a Me Too-era law that banned NDAs in sexual harassment cases, but soon realized the bill did not provide protections for other forms of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06SGwv"&gt;Now, that’s changing. Workers in California will be legally protected for speaking out about discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age. &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;You can see the changes in detail here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF7lRv"&gt;The law could have enormous implications for the tech industry, which is famous for having workers sign extremely restrictive NDAs. While it will only protect employees in California, Ozoma has plans to expand it to other parts of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0YG38"&gt;The bill is sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association, Ozoma’s organization Earthseed, and Equal Rights Advocates. It will take effect on January 1st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoOi5Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382148/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act-sb331-discrimination-harassment"&gt;Pinterest agreed to proactively stop making workers sign NDAs&lt;/a&gt; that kept them from discussing “their personal experiences at Pinterest” back in April, after Ozoma’s accusations but months ahead of the law’s passage. Apple, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661536/apple-shareholder-resolution-change-nda-harassment-discrimination"&gt;refused to add language to its employment agreements&lt;/a&gt; to make it clear that employees could discuss workplace harassment and discrimination, after activists and Apple shareholders pressured the company with a shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A friendly reminder that Hulu’s price is going up October 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z084qf1egvn-XPjZF8HqdHS0FA8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966948/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qWATDI"&gt;Hulu’s prices are going up beginning Friday, October 8th for both its monthly and annual subscription tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NoMMc"&gt;It was initially reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Hulu’s monthly cost would increase by $1 per month or $10 per year (ad-supported) to $7 monthly (ad-supported), $13 monthly (no-ads), and $70 per year, respectively. Both Hulu’s base ad-supported and ad-free monthly subscription prices are going up in price by a dollar, but neither of its live TV tiers will be impacted. (Those plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price increase&lt;/a&gt; late last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asUaZ8"&gt;In a recent email to subscribers, Hulu wrote that the price hike “will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 8.” Users will be charged the new price unless they cancel their subscription on or before Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVmgZ5"&gt;Hulu has said that those subscribed through a discount or promotional offer will not be affected by the price increase. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824"&gt;company said&lt;/a&gt; back in September that those who subscribe to Hulu through the Disney Bundle will not be impacted, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKwquY"&gt;While regular price increases have become a to-be-expected inconvenience of the streaming wars, Hulu’s also introduced a handful of changes to its service this year prior to the hike. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599326/hulu-nfl-network-redzone-sports-add-on"&gt;NFL Network and RedZone&lt;/a&gt; were added to Hulu’s live TV service in July, and its live TV service in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412295/hulu-live-tv-service-nickelodeon-comedy-central-mtv-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;additionally added&lt;/a&gt; ViacomCBS-owned channels, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and MTV. Lastly, it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639273/hulu-hdr-original-shows-movies-4k-picture-quality"&gt;announced support&lt;/a&gt; for HDR on some — but not all — of its originals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo engineers suggest Switch Joy-Con drift will never be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmJLD70h9Irl3sz4wrQaErDkwE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966783/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0153.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UoljsC"&gt;One of the Nintendo Switch’s persistent flaws has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;been Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon where players observe false inputs when they aren’t even touching the joysticks on the controllers.  Nintendo has been relatively quiet on the subject for years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;the company refused to say&lt;/a&gt; whether the new OLED-equipped Nintendo Switch OLED had fixed the issue. But today, the company is breaking its silence in a big way — and suggesting that Joy-Con drift may never be fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ENQU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-4/"&gt;In a new Q&amp;amp;A about the development of the Nintendo Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, the company reveals  that it has steadily been making improvements to the Joy-Cons to try and make them more reliable. The joysticks that came with 2019’s Switch Lite aren’t the same as those in the original 2017 Switch, and they’re continually getting refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF8na2"&gt;But Ko Shiota, a Nintendo executive who also serves as GM of Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, basically says that the Joy-Con will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wear down over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pOfAuW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you mean that, basically, wear is unavoidable as long as the parts are physically in contact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtIRq3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shiota:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for example car tires wear out as the car moves, as they are in constant friction with the ground to rotate. So with that same premise, we asked ourselves how we can improve durability, and not only that, but how can both operability and durability coexist? It’s something we are continuously tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wqxr6F"&gt;The joysticks included with the OLED model “are the latest version with all the improvements,” as are the joysticks that ship with the base Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, Joy-Con controllers, and Pro Controllers, the company says. “The analog-stick parts have continuously been improved since launch, and we are still working on improvements,” says deputy general manager Toru Yamashita. When you get your Joy-Cons repaired, Yamashita says they’ll use the latest versions of those sticks for the repairs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOt8WP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;The OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; will be released on Friday, and we’ll have to wait and see if these improvements actually make the Joy-Cons more resilient to drift over time. But it seems that Nintendo never expects to solve Joy-Con drift entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5VILM"&gt;The full interview is long, but worth &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-1/"&gt;reading in full&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s a rare opportunity to hear straight from Nintendo about how it develops hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has promised to actively look into right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzIDdZkF0oeKgvoBHx4ikxbp6jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966690/DSCF1189.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1aWrGd"&gt;Microsoft has agreed to have an independent third-party study the potential impact of it making its devices easier to repair and to make changes based on those findings by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The agreement was made after As You Sow &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/6/24/investors-urge-microsoft-consumers-right-to-repair-electronic-devices"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking Microsoft to look into the potential impact that it could make by making it easier for consumers to get their devices repaired. &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow has withdrawn its resolution&lt;/a&gt; in return for Microsoft conducting the study and making parts and documentation more available to repair shops that aren’t official Microsoft service providers based on the study’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d3xti"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow calls Microsoft’s commitment&lt;/a&gt; “an encouraging step,” but it’s worth keeping in perspective that it is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a step — what Microsoft has actually done today is said that it’ll have a study done and then use it to “guide” its “product design and plans for expanding device repair options,” according to a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by a Microsoft spokesperson. The fact that the company is at least willing to do that is encouraging and is more than other tech giants have done when it comes to right to repair. But without details, it’s hard to say how big of an impact this will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uOprCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft reportedly won’t release the actual study&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIyGEA"&gt;It’s also unclear whether the public will end up getting those details or not. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft will have to post a summary of the study by May 2022, but not the actual study itself (citing concerns over trade secrets). With that said, it should be easy to tell if Microsoft is sticking to its word on this — either it’ll become easier to get your Surface Pro or Xbox repaired at a third-party store, or it won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQHFEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt; also quotes iFixit’s US policy directory, which brings up Microsoft’s lobbying efforts. &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/who-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-right-repair-companies-worth-over-10-trillion"&gt;According to the US Public Interest Research Group&lt;/a&gt; (or US PIRG), Microsoft has been involved in lobbying against right-to-repair laws in Colorado and Washington. If that kind of behavior continues, it would be hard to give Microsoft props for any positive work it does for right to repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LBAxPv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit calls Microsoft’s agreement a “huge, landmark move”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fn3Xcg"&gt;Despite the caveats, right to repair supporters see this agreement as a good thing. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kwiens/status/1446167245965586432"&gt;iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens called it&lt;/a&gt; a “huge, landmark move” on Twitter and, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said that it “wasn’t just talk,” citing the Surface Laptop’s improvements in repairability over the years. PRIG’s right to repair campaign manager also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “the real deal” and cited it as evidence as Microsoft “changing its tune” about right to repair. If it does end up making significant changes, Microsoft could end up ahead of the curve when it comes to reducing its products’ impact on e-waste and emissions — both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; have been working to clamp down on companies illegally making it harder for consumers to get their devices repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
