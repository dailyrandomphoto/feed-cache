    <title>Zuckerberg says original Oculus Quest will get Air Link wireless streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8uPlU9day7U464fy_I1hiC7blqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69458128/akrales_190429_3371_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQO7Ua"&gt;Owners of the original Oculus Quest will get the ability to stream from their PCs to their headsets wirelessly, using the Air Link system that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;been available to Quest 2 &lt;/a&gt;owners for a few months. When the feature was originally announced, it was an open question as to when the first-gen headset would get it (or if it even would), but &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113230565252971"&gt;under a post&lt;/a&gt; about the v30 update for Quest, Mark Zuckerberg said that Air Link would be coming “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeN9A6S0huEjLf_IP-9kuYZri9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661183/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zuckerberg’s post about the v30 update and his comment about Air Link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NLuLNg"&gt;In the post itself, he also shows off being able to use multiple windows to multitask in Oculus Home, which acts as a virtual environment. In the video, he opens three windows at once, creating an environment not unlike sitting in front of three curved monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJsxqD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-guardian-size-increasing/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the v30 update will also include the ability to create a bigger play space, with the Guardian system being updated to handle boundaries of 15m by 15m, or  just over 2,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoIZnt"&gt;At the moment, Facebook hasn’t said when the v30 update will be coming out. The company said it didn’t have anything to add to Mark’s post when asked for comment about the release date, and wouldn’t say whether Air Link for the original Quest would be included in the v30 release or a different future update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Noctua’s long-awaited passive CPU cooler is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Carvf2ORZcTbaWKWArcGl-pHOTo=/0x0:1712x1141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69458104/noctua_passive_cpu_cooler.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Nk5oo"&gt;Noctua is known for making mighty quiet PC fans, and now it has a CPU cooler that doesn’t need a fan at all. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/noctuas-15kg-fanless-heatsink-cools-a-core-i9-9900k"&gt;Two years after&lt;/a&gt; announcing a passive heatsink potent enough to keep a Core i9-9900K CPU in check, the dead-silent &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-p1"&gt;Noctua NH-P1&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/press-release/noctua-launches-its-nh-p1-passive-cpu-cooler-for-110-usd"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;has finally gone &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WC64NN8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale today for $110&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an absolute unit at 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC0Tgm"&gt;According to the company’s delightfully ASMR build video below (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/au/noctua-passive-pc-build-guide-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the final product’s six soldered heatpipes and thick fins are good enough to run a Core i9-11900K near its TDP of 125W, and even give you a slight overclock to 3.6GHz, though it’ll heavily depend on your case and other components that might also generate heat. The company has a whole set of &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-p1-setup-guidelines"&gt;setup guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://ncc.noctua.at/coolers/NH-P1-68/cpus"&gt;CPU compatibility list&lt;/a&gt;, and even a list of &lt;a href="https://ncc.noctua.at/recommended/NH-P1-68/cases"&gt;recommended cases&lt;/a&gt; so you know what you’re getting into and start off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3iMWc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khbvxsPTI84?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T11Lgr"&gt;Assuming you’ve got those things in check, you shouldn’t have too much trouble fitting it to your motherboard: it appears to be compatible with all modern desktop CPU sockets and has “100% RAM clearance on LGA1200 and AM4,” with a note that you might want to avoid tall RAM modules if you’re using an LGA2066 motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sT_zD04Ai7U12zTAVkduJxkNVd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661268/981_2021_06_15_981_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="89AdRO"&gt;The company also has a quiet (12.1dB) new 120mm fan, the &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a12x25-ls-pwm.html"&gt;NF-A12x25 LS-PWM&lt;/a&gt;, if you really want an extra burst of cooling on occasion. It’s set to come to a dead stop at 0 percent PWM, so your fan controller can only turn it on when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The best anti-Prime Day deals included&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vDuFME"&gt;Amazon Prime Day 2021 is nearly here. The annual shopping event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;begins at 12AM PT / 3AM ET&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 21st, and continues through 12AM PT / 3AM ET on Tuesday, June 22nd. Like previous years, the retail giant will use the two-day affair to discount a range of popular Amazon products, including the Echo Dot and Echo Buds, along with headphones, laptops, 4K TVs, gaming accessories, and a host of other tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNGkLC"&gt;This year, we’re going to highlight the best Prime Day deals across the spectrum, so you can find the lowest prices with ease and kickstart your holiday shopping well ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We’re also going to cover the best deals available at Walmart, Target, and other non-Amazon retailers that have decided to host competing sales during Amazon’s main event. You can find a list of our expanded coverage below, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;follow @VergeDeals on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with the latest deals as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can sign up to learn when Dish’s under-construction 5G network will launch near you </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ot7do3ZJDCrNxjjoO9rAkdmNoFM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69457684/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish has some ambitious targets ahead of it as it prepares to launch its own 5G network.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQQI89"&gt;With the clock ticking down toward its deployment goal this fall, Dish Network has &lt;a href="https://launch.5gmobilegenesis.com/"&gt;launched a website&lt;/a&gt; with more information on its forthcoming 5G network. There’s not much to the site — just a slightly cryptic name (Project Gene5is) and a link to sign up for a notification when the service is available in your area. Its appearance was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-5g-signups-50b8654d-7aa5-4112-b22d-bd2ee0de1ec1.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no mention of it or the Project Gene5is name on Dish’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dish.com%2Fwireless%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22535566%2Fdish-network-5g-availability-project-genesis" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;main wireless network page&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it’s an indication that Dish is moving in the right direction toward a network launch, which it needs to do if it’s going to hit its ambitious targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L8Upd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish has promised&lt;/a&gt; to bring its under-development 5G network to life later this summer starting with Las Vegas. That’s just the first stepping stone toward its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;larger goal of covering 70 percent of the US population&lt;/a&gt; by June 2023. This would put Dish in position as the country’s missing fourth wireless carrier, and setting the company up to be that fourth carrier was a condition of the T-Mobile / Sprint acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCCrfG"&gt;Things haven’t exactly gone smoothly for Dish since then. The company is in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;dispute with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; over its impending CDMA network shutdown, which is scheduled for January 1st, 2022. Dish argues that this is much sooner than it had anticipated, and a significant number of its Boost Mobile customers — acquired as part of the Sprint merger deal — could lose service entirely as a result. This might be an unwelcome distraction for Dish, but on an investor call earlier this year, chairman Charlie Ergen was as bullish as ever on the company’s ability to get a brand-new network off the ground — in his words: “This isn’t our first rodeo.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott announces Series C investment in ordinary human beings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLDp_kavncGfapxk3ZaLKugOxUI=/1541x4:2674x759/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69457584/1079533926.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tQzrnA"&gt;MacKenzie Scott, whose estimated fortune stands somewhere around $60 billion, announced via &lt;a href="https://mackenzie-scott.medium.com/seeding-by-ceding-ea6de642bf"&gt;a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; today that she would be parting with a $2.7 billion portion of that wealth and distributing it to 286 groups, all of which are painstakingly named and linked at the end of her note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp0SYu"&gt;This third and latest gift brings Scott’s total &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345440/mackenzie-scott-jeff-bezos-amazon-wealth-donation-philanthropy"&gt;charitable contributions&lt;/a&gt; to society to around $8.5 billion in the past year alone — making her one of the planet’s most generous billionaires. The amount puts her well ahead of the lifetime gifts doled out by the likes of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg ($2.7 billion), Michael Dell of his eponymous computer corporation ($2.25 billion), Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer ($1.4 billion), or eBay’s Pierre Omidyar ($1.3 billion), &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswealthteam/2021/01/19/americas-top-givers-the-25-most-philanthropic-billionaires/?sh=5bc9d0771f59"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfl5lS"&gt;Jeff Bezos, currently the world’s richest man, has rarely appeared on similar lists of the most charitable donors. He &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazoncom-inc-race-and-ethnicity-jeff-bezos-philanthropy-coronavirus-pandemic-56154051ca19fdd80c2fc003004702b0"&gt;topped the list in 2020&lt;/a&gt; by pledging $20 billion toward a climate change-focused fund named after himself but has, based on &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/11/16/bezos-climate-grants/"&gt;the most recent reports&lt;/a&gt;, distributed less than 4 percent of that amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBQZBJ"&gt;Scott was married to Bezos from 1993 to 2019. She left the relationship with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295609/jeff-bezos-amazon-mackenzie-voting-power-control-blue-origin"&gt;a significant portion&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon’s stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vn1Bfu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We encouraged them to spend it however they choose”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kWsUax"&gt;Scott, who “likely set a record for the largest annual distribution by a living person” last year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-15/mackenzie-scott-has-given-away-another-2-7-billion-to-charity?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is also known for her no-strings-attached approach to donations. “We believe that teams with experience on the front lines of challenges will know best how to put the money to good use,” Scott, and her husband Dan Jewett, a science teacher, wrote, “we encouraged them to spend it however they choose.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNQqVZ"&gt;Like some other wealthy notables, Scott has signed onto the Giving Pledge, which — though not legally binding — is a public commitment for at least half of one’s wealth to be distributed to charity, either during their lifetime or at the time of their death. Though in Scott’s case, her more pressing issue might be figuring out how to give her riches away fast enough (while being thoughtful and responsible to divest it). “It would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands,” Scott wrote in her Medium post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0YXSc"&gt;While Scott continues to invest in making the planet better for humans to live on, an increasing number of her peers seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;intent to escape&lt;/a&gt; the place altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is selling the first web browser’s code as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVzjJp85YHeN5WVcuda6P1H7FE0=/0x19:2330x1572/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69457487/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.28.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bLwuMm"&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee, one of the architects of the World Wide Web, is selling the source code to the original web browser as an NFT (&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57474504"&gt;via the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The auction, being run by Sotheby’s, will not only include the code for the WorldWideWeb browser, but also a letter from Berners-Lee himself, a vector file that could be printed as a poster, and a 30-minute silent video that depicts the code being typed out. According to a press release from Sotheby’s, the proceeds will benefit causes supported by Berners-Lee and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApJWCc"&gt;The code up for auction contains elements of the web that many of us are familiar with today, including functions to parse and display HTML documents, rudimentary styling support, the HTTP protocol, and even the ability to print a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfED15"&gt;Berners-Lee seems to think NFTs are a natural fit for code — in the press release, he says that NFTs are “the latest playful creations&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;on the internet and &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;the ideal way to package the origins behind the web.” In &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a77ad1bf-fae0-478b-aa05-a07790314ebc"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he compares the NFT to an autographed book, which just makes me imagine how much cooler this project would be if he had instead auctioned off the code on a signed box of magneto-optical disks that would’ve been used by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee#/media/File:First_Web_Server.jpg"&gt;the NeXT Computer he used to write it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ISs6Iv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vMHC5M"&gt;The NFT’s buyer may have trouble actually running the very first version of WorldWideWeb. As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/tim-berners-lee-makes-an-nft-from-world-wide-webs-objective-c/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a very early copy of the source code &lt;a href="https://github.com/cynthia/WorldWideWeb"&gt;available on the web today&lt;/a&gt; (which Sotheby’s says is similar to the code being sold in the NFT, but not the original), and it seems difficult to compile according to &lt;a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/code/"&gt;CERN’s WorldWideWeb site&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the buyer got the original browser running, there are likely precious few websites still around that would work well with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvUG0M"&gt;Arguably, the web as we know it was made possible by the fact that Berners-Lee decided not to patent or charge for use of his idea, letting anyone with the technical know-how (and computer resources) design their own website. It’s easy to see, then, why some would find creating an exclusive NFT out of it as a bit of an odd choice for Tim Berners-Lee, on top of the environmental concerns around the tech. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a77ad1bf-fae0-478b-aa05-a07790314ebc"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it will be the first time he’s directly profited off his creation — although he says he won’t be keeping that money himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHXAgP"&gt;If you’d like to see an approximation of Berners-Lee’s original browser, &lt;a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch"&gt;CERN has a replica&lt;/a&gt; that you can run right in your modern web browser (though accessing websites from it appears to be broken at the moment). If you’re really looking to grab the NFT, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fthis-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft%2Fsource-code-for-the-www%3Flocale%3Den&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22535479%2Ftim-berners-lee-nft-worldwideweb-source-code-auction" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Sotheby’s auction&lt;/a&gt; is running from June 23rd to the 30th, with bidding starting at $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX ignored last-minute warnings from the FAA before December Starship launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISyVj-2fFj0of04UTUDwpBAv5Co=/233x0:2624x1594/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69457287/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_2.17.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s company was told SN8’s launch would violate its FAA license, but SpaceX launched anyway&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zL0DlN"&gt;Minutes before liftoff, Elon Musk’s SpaceX ignored at least two warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration that launching its first high-altitude Starship prototype last December would violate the company’s launch license, confidential documents and letters obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; show. And while SpaceX was under investigation, it told the FAA that the agency’s software was a “source of frustration” that has been “shown to be inaccurate at times or overly conservative,” according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7qtXcQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“SpaceX used analytical methods that appeared to be hastily developed to meet a launch window.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJoQDq"&gt;SpaceX’s violation of its launch license was “inconsistent with a strong safety culture,” the FAA’s space division chief Wayne Monteith said in a letter to SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell. “Although the report states that all SpaceX parties believed that such risk was sufficiently low to comply with regulatory criteria, SpaceX used analytical methods that appeared to be hastily developed to meet a launch window,” Monteith went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAqFaZ"&gt;Launch violations are rare in the industry, even as private contractors have taken over work that once was the US government’s alone. SpaceX occupies a particularly dominant position, as it is now NASA’s only ride to the International Space Station and the Moon. The documents exclusively obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; show how SpaceX prioritized speed over safety when launching on its own private rocket playground. Ultimately, the FAA didn’t sanction SpaceX, and less than two months later, SpaceX resumed flights in Boca Chica, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh1GYZ"&gt;For Musk, SpaceX’s CEO who was on site for SN8’s launch day, the violation is one of the latest tussles with regulators overseeing his companies. After settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over an attempt to take Tesla private, Musk was told his tweets about the company needed a lawyer’s sign-off. Shortly after, he went on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/9/18133591/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-60-minutes-interview-twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; to say no one was approving his tweets&lt;/a&gt;; the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295240/elon-musk-sec-tweets-judge-nyc-ruling"&gt;brought him back to court&lt;/a&gt;, though Musk’s tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;have continued to raise eyebrows&lt;/a&gt; with no apparent consequences. In 2020, Musk’s Fremont Tesla factory violated local safety orders, defying the local government’s stay-at-home order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;to work through the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Musk taunted local officials, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255149/elon-musk-tesla-fremont-factory-reopen-order-arrest-alameda"&gt;inviting them to come arrest him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKoGQT"&gt;SpaceX emerged from the December launch violation relatively unscathed. The company has since won a $2.9 billion contract to put NASA astronauts on a Starship flight to the Moon in 2024 — the first and only such contract in a half-century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kprvQZ"&gt;Neither SpaceX nor Musk has publicly commented on the SN8 violation. SpaceX didn’t respond to a request for comment. The FAA confirmed the violation after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January. But a confidential five-page report by SpaceX and letters between Shotwell and Monteith reveal what SpaceX employees knew before liftoff and detail how the company responded to its violation in the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JI2bJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FAA rejected SpaceX data in multiple launch day meetings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8vMxe"&gt;SpaceX first attempted to launch SN8 at SpaceX’s South Texas Starship campus on December 8th with FAA approval, but it scrubbed due to an engine issue. Launch day on December 9th, when weather conditions changed, was full of ad hoc meetings between company employees and FAA officials, who repeatedly rejected SpaceX’s weather and launch modeling data that purported to show SN8 was safe to fly, according to a five-page SpaceX report. It was unclear what role, if any, Musk himself played in the decision to launch SN8.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZS2rv4NxqTlk0tGUiowKTnuiLsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660826/Jun_15_2021_15_48_10.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s SN8 Starship prototype successfully lifts off in violation of its launch license.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fsAcy5"&gt;The FAA’s models showed that if the rocket exploded, its shockwave could be strengthened by various weather conditions like wind speed and endanger nearby homes. As a new launch countdown clock was ticking, SpaceX asked the FAA to waive this safety threshold at 1:42PM, but the FAA rejected the request an hour later. SpaceX paused the countdown clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hDRF4"&gt;SpaceX’s director of launch operations, whose name wasn’t provided in the report, restarted the launch countdown clock shortly after. The report said the director had “the impression that” SpaceX’s data was sufficient. But that wasn’t the case. As the launch clock was counting down, SpaceX staff in the meeting made little progress — 15 minutes before liftoff, “the FAA informed SpaceX that the weather data provided was not sufficient.” The same safety risk remained, and SN8 wasn’t cleared for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QwIfXt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX staff “assumed that the inspector did not have the latest information”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uREhj9"&gt;SpaceX employees left the FAA meeting for the company’s launch control room ahead of SN8’s launch. Minutes before liftoff, an FAA safety inspector speaking on an open phone line warned SpaceX’s staff in the launch control room that a launch would violate the company’s launch license. SpaceX staff ignored the warning because they “assumed that the inspector did not have the latest information,” the SpaceX report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="un5bho"&gt;SpaceX launched the rocket anyway. The steel-clad SN8 prototype flew more than six miles over the company’s private rocket facilities on the coast of Boca Chica, Texas, and blew to smithereens upon landing. No injuries or damage to any homes were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Mr0YhqLVRB-uxQEACBllYgsN1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660830/Jun_15_2021_15_51_22.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SN8 perishes in an explosive “hard landing”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dVjGRl"&gt;In one letter to Shotwell, Monteith cited SpaceX’s report and slammed the company for proceeding with the launch “based on ‘impressions’ and ‘assumptions,’ rather than procedural checks and positive affirmations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkLVIT"&gt;“These actions show a concerning lack of operational control and process discipline that is inconsistent with a strong safety culture,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qxe9t0"&gt;SpaceX agreed to take over a dozen corrective measures but defended its own data and decision-making. The company criticized the FAA’s launch-weather modeling software. The software’s results, SpaceX said, can be intentionally interfered with to provide “better or worse results for an identical scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txbf1l"&gt;SpaceX has complained to the FAA in the past about the software, but “this feedback has not driven any action, contributing to the situation described above,” the report said. A “closer and more direct dialogue” with FAA officials would’ve smoothed the FAA discussions before SN8’s launch, SpaceX added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S8913z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX: “closer and more direct dialogue” needed with the FAA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyi3Cd"&gt;SpaceX also proposed corrective measures: pausing the launch countdown clocks if an FAA inspector says there’s a violation and lowering the threshold for manually detonating an errant rocket midflight, before a more dangerous explosion occurs. The company also proposed to build at least four new launch and weather modeling tools with the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxZMtk"&gt;Monteith wasn’t happy with SpaceX’s response. He ordered SpaceX to reevaluate its safety procedures and launch day chain of command, and he urged it to go back and review the launch control room phone lines to spot any times SpaceX strayed from the license’s communication plan. He also required an FAA inspector to be physically present in Texas for every Starship prototype launch in the future. Flying inspectors from offices in Florida to rural Texas for each launch isn’t easy, so the FAA might base one in Houston for a shorter trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn4kHJ"&gt;FAA investigators couldn’t determine whether the SN8 license violation was intentional, according to people involved in and briefed on the investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity. That’s partially why the FAA review of the violation wasn’t a more in-depth investigation that could have resulted in fines or stronger consequences. FAA officials also believed grounding Starship and foisting a two-month investigation on a multibillion-dollar company focused heavily on speedy timelines would be a more effective penalty than imposing relatively trivial fines, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2DkZk7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX acknowledged its Starship site “was not mature enough” to function as a range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hH4mwe"&gt;SN8 marked SpaceX’s first high-altitude launch outside of its other launch sites in Florida and California, where Air Force officials who monitor local weather conditions tell the company whether it’s safe to launch. Those government officials, formally called Range safety officials, don’t exist at SpaceX’s private rocket facilities in south Texas. SpaceX was primarily responsible for its own range safety during SN8’s launch, a responsibility in which it had very little experience. The company acknowledged in its report that the Starship site “was not mature enough” to function as a range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Yylva"&gt;SpaceX is moving ahead anyway. Since the launch violation, it’s launched four more rockets at the Starship site and even landed one successfully — all with FAA approval and a few changes to its operations. Unlike SN8, which launched on an automatic timer, other Starship launches now require a final “go” command from a human operator, Shotwell said in a letter to Monteith. And it is taking a stab at maturity, at least with its range safety tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BjYKd"&gt;At least one of the new launch-weather models SpaceX proposed, designed to bolster its range capabilities, has already taken shape. The company is building a database of wind patterns over Boca Chica to help inform its launch day weather modeling, using an experimental tool to gather wind speed data, according to a document the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMT2Iw"&gt;But new weather tools won’t change Musk’s Twitter presence, a concern for agency officials and lawmakers who worry the CEO’s candid tweets influence SpaceX employees and put unfair pressure on launch safety processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0j68w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Pressure exerted on the FAA during high profile launches”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JuQgU7"&gt;As the FAA’s review of SpaceX’s safety culture investigation was nearing completion in late January, holding up the company’s SN9 launch for a few days, Musk tweeted that the FAA’s “space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure” and that, under its rules, “humanity will never get to Mars.” An FAA spokesman replied, saying the agency “will not compromise its responsibility to protect public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFEiaz"&gt;The House transportation committee that oversees the FAA opened its own probe into SpaceX’s SN8 violation in February as well as “the FAA’s subsequent response, and the pressure exerted on the FAA during high profile launches,” chairs of the committee and its aviation subcommittee wrote to the agency’s administrator Steve Dickson. SpaceX’s recent launch activities raise serious questions about whether the FAA is under “potential undue influence” in making safety decisions, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6msP6r"&gt;In March, after an onsite FAA inspector left town for the weekend following a week of anticipation for the company’s SN11 prototype launch, SpaceX emailed the inspector on Sunday to return for a Monday liftoff, according to a person familiar with the exchange. The inspector, taking the weekend off, missed the email at first but hopped on an early Monday morning flight back to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="luIeI7"&gt;“FAA inspector unable to reach Starbase in time for launch today,” Musk wrote on Twitter, stirring up vitriol against the FAA in SpaceX’s fan base bubbles on Twitter and Reddit. The inspector landed in Texas, and SN11 launched the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors stops work on electric van to focus on pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ub4qYb8Ytnn8_PzTnvs14JBh9_U=/153x0:1773x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69457203/march_slide_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1cwuv"&gt;Lordstown Motors has stopped working on an electric van and other future projects in order to aim all resources at putting its first vehicle, a pickup truck called Endurance, into production later this year. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/03/17/2194909/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html"&gt;previously announced in March&lt;/a&gt; that it was accelerating work on the van, but it has struggled since then, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; resigning this week after an investigation into misleading claims about preorders for the Endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJS0Gi"&gt;Burns previously billed the van as a “high-top” recreational vehicle with up to 350 miles of range. He said that it would be the “first mass produced all-electric RV,” and that Lordstown Motors believed “there will be many commercial use cases for an electric van of this size and capability.” But that will have to wait while the startup focuses on surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LAlyuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was supposed to be the “first mass produced all-electric RV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUsHtN"&gt;“We do have a prototype van that’s been completed, and it shares a lot of commonized parts with the Endurance. It will possibly be shown later in the summer, but at this point, we’re currently focused only on the Endurance,” Lordstown Motors president Rich Schmidt said during an Automotive Press Association event on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoLuaN"&gt;Schmidt also said that a collaboration with RV company Camping World is on hold, which is supposed to involve service centers that would support the van. “Again we’re just focused currently on the Endurance truck. That’s our next goal for the next three months, is to make sure we hit our production targets and stay within our budgets and drive forward to getting the vehicles ready for the market,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKp00J"&gt;Lordstown Motors interim CEO Angela Strand confirmed during the event that the startup still plans to start limited production of the Endurance in late September of this year. But Schmidt confirmed Tuesday that Lordstown Motors only has enough funding to make trucks through May 2022. That’s despite the fact that Lordstown Motors raised $675 million late last year after it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and became a publicly traded company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pAfXML"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The van was supposed to be revealed this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZu2LG"&gt;Lordstown Motors said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021003449/ride-20201231x10k.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_"&gt;March in its annual report&lt;/a&gt; filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it planned to reveal the electric van in June and start production in late 2022. But Schmidt said Tuesday that it will now “possibly be shown later in the summer.” The startup also recently filed &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021008107/ride-20201231x10ka.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_"&gt;an amended version of its annual report&lt;/a&gt;, and the section about the van was removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtLcwZ"&gt;Representatives for Lordstown Motors and Camping World did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0iw15"&gt;Burns founded Lordstown Motors in 2019 after he left another EV startup called Workhorse. Lordstown Motors quickly snapped up a shuttered plant (and equipment) from General Motors, a deal that was praised by then-President Donald Trump, and licensed an in-development electric pickup truck from Workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQe3Yn"&gt;Having a factory and a vehicle that was already largely designed was a huge part of the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000121390020019762/ea124863ex99-2_diamondpeak.htm"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; Lordstown Motors made in 2020 to potential SPAC partners. Lordstown Motors said in its investor presentation that it had a “clear path to be first to market” in offering an all-electric commercial pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gA0fmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"},{"title":"Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RCqBjZ"&gt;But the startup has struggled lately. Short-selling firm Hindenburg Research published a report in March full of allegations that Lordstown Motors had misled investors about how many preorders it had collected for the Endurance, and claimed that the startup was behind on its target production date. The SEC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;subsequently opened an official probe&lt;/a&gt; into the claims, and Lordstown Motors assembled its own committee to investigate the allegations in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mOS45"&gt;Lordstown Motors said shortly after the report was published that it would share “a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.” Burns told a &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/theres-always-haters-lordstown-motors-ceo-responds-to-negative-report/"&gt;local news outlet&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “always haters,” and that he “quoted Taylor Swift to somebody the other day: ‘Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.’ You gotta shake it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAGk4N"&gt;Lordstown Motors remained mostly silent on the report until this week, when the company’s committee and the board of directors released their findings. While they disputed Hindenburg’s claims about problems with the Endurance’s development, they confirmed that Lordstown Motors executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;had misled investors about the viability of the preorders it had collected&lt;/a&gt;. Burns and Rodriguez announced their resignations the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9PliY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a new day at Lordstown”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n86san"&gt;In the interim, Lordstown Motors lowered its goal for how many trucks it plans to make in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;announced that it needed to raise more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ph60PS"&gt;Schmidt said Tuesday that he believes Lordstown Motors now has enough committed customers for the reduced number of trucks the startup can build by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksBMfk"&gt;“It’s a new day at Lordstown, and there are no disruptions and will be no disruptions to our day to day operations,” Strand said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmQ6oaDvBDaPKyZGqgafUCHjit0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456816/amazon_covid_19_test_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPmBxE"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZR5XNBM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling its own&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 test kit directly to customers. Results from the test will appear on an &lt;a href="https://amazondx.com/"&gt;Amazon diagnostics website&lt;/a&gt; that was originally designed for use by Amazon employees. The test’s public availability was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/15/amazon-covid-test-consumers-diagnostics-portal/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQRTgB"&gt;The test is on sale for $39.99 and has one-day shipping through Prime in some areas of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz3jdB"&gt;To use the test, a patient swabs their own nose at home and places it in a box with a prepaid shipping return label. The swabs are then sent to a centralized lab. Amazon got the Food and Drug Administration’s sign-off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353058/amazon-fda-authorization-covid-test-home"&gt;its COVID-19 test kit&lt;/a&gt; in March. At the time, it planned to use the test for its onsite employee testing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krCFSr"&gt;At-home medical testing got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;new burst of attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, as companies raced to deliver COVID-19 tests that people could take easily without a trip to the doctor’s office. Experts think it’ll supercharge efforts to bring other types of at-home tests, like flu tests, to the market more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBjYbZ"&gt;Amazon also offers a COVID-19 testing kit made by the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DxTerity-COVID-19-Collection-Shipping-Laboratory/dp/B08Q1TMY7X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=30VY1AKJTC7CA&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=dxterity+covid-19+saliva+at-home+collection+kit&amp;amp;qid=1623782784&amp;amp;sprefix=dxterity%2Caps%2C160&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;genomics company DxTerity&lt;/a&gt; and a rapid 10-minute testing kit made by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quidel-QuickVue-at-Home-COVID-19-Test/dp/B093ND7LX4/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=30VY1AKJTC7CA&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=dxterity+covid-19+saliva+at-home+collection+kit&amp;amp;qid=1623782784&amp;amp;sprefix=dxterity%2Caps%2C160&amp;amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExUUI4S1pQVk5BU0FDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODE2NzQ1TTY5RVk3QkZOVE4wJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNzcyNDNXV1ZFSVZDODE4Nk8md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Quidel&lt;/a&gt;. They sell for $99 and $24.95, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7HqRb"&gt;The in-house COVID-19 test kit is the latest in Amazon’s expansion into healthcare. The company started offering its telehealth and at-home healthcare program to other employers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336010/amazon-care-expand-employees-virtual"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also offering &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-pharmacy-to-offer-six-month-prescriptions-starting-at-6"&gt;six-month prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; for common medications starting at $6 through its Amazon Pharmacy program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G528YV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Prime Day deals</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqjWjM"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the retail giant’s two-day blitz of deals and promotions, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;lands on June 21st&lt;/a&gt;. The annual shopping event is taking a place a few weeks earlier than it has in the past, yet despite still being a week away, Amazon has already kick-started the event with a slew of deals for Amazon Prime subscribers, discounting everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to the latest pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are likely to go live in the days leading up to the main event, too, with retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy joining the shopping fray with deals of their own, many of which will rival Amazon’s offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQOiJ"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals. In most instances, all you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the deals, however, a few promotions come with some additional caveats that we’ll note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PzRclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":" The Verge’s Father’s Day Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Omrvrp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds (second-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D7ZuXF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; were appealing when they launched two months ago — and that was before they received a $40 discount. They also improve upon their predecessors in almost every way, offering up enjoyable sound, better comfort, and effective noise cancellation that helps you to drown out the world around you. They can’t compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds, or a way to bring Alexa with you on the go, the Echo Buds are it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPdJR0"&gt;Right now, you can snag the standard, second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTY1HQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white for $80. Amazon is also offering $40 off the version with the wireless charging case, bringing the price down to $100 for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFw2gO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LChb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gXr8Hu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt; is no Fitbit, but if you don’t mind a little invasiveness and can get around the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated screen, it’s a convenient way to track your sleep habits, chart your physical activity, and access a host of workout programs. While the woven, band-like device can track basic fitness metrics like your steps and heart rate, it can also measure your body fat percentage and the tone of your voice, a tool which will supposedly measure your emotional state throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTy0WF"&gt;The Amazon Halo is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QKPCQKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in several sizes and color configurations for $70, the lowest price we’ve seen the band since its debut in August 2020. The fitness tracker also comes with a six-month membership, after which you’ll be required to pay $3.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vU2DAg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="AnofkV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sign up for Amazon Prime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="lpBzPI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 (first-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V6vA7l"&gt;The recently updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best smart displays you can get for the bedroom, however, it’s also not nearly as affordable as its last-gen counterpart. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; offers much of the same functionality in the same compact package. Like the newer model, it features a vibrant touchscreen and a host of voice-activated features, and while its 1-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired, it does come with a physical shutter if you’re someone who prefers privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiR31X"&gt;Normally $80, the Echo Show is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;priced at $45&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet on Amazon’s capable smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFqJae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHMESO"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (fourth-gen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7fd6rg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s latest entry-level smart speaker, is yet another refinement of what has become the most popular model in the Echo lineup. Despite its price and size, the Alex-equipped speaker still manages to tout impressive sound and a commendable set of mics, which allow you to play music, control your smart home gadgets, and carry out the full range of commands you might find on other, more capable Echo devices. It’s the entry-level smart speaker to get, even if the new design isn’t as convenient for mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrCp0b"&gt;Now through Prime Day, the fourth-gen Echo Dot is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-Blue/dp/B084J4MZK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get one free&lt;/a&gt; with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PDDOT2PK &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiqUna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BMm3YQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JpmtUX"&gt;If you haven’t tried Amazon Music Unlimited before, Amazon is offering Prime members a four-month free trial to the popular Spotify and Apple Music alternative. Its feature set is akin to most of its competitors, however, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;offers lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost, a perk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple recently rolled&lt;/a&gt; out to Apple Music subscribers. With Amazon Music Unlimited, you’ll gain access to ad-free listening, podcasts, and a robust catalog of more than 70 million songs, not to mention the service’s deep integration with Amazon devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEAkAT"&gt;Just be sure to cancel your subscription before the trial ends if you no longer want to continue subscribing after the four-month window. Otherwise, you’ll automatically be charged an $8 monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96zkrl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LMENHd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2NBjU1"&gt;The Amazon Echo remains the namesake of the current Echo lineup. Although it shares much of its functionality with the aforementioned Echo Dot, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Echo&lt;/a&gt; produces bigger, bolder sound and features a built-in smart home hub, meaning you can connect it with lightbulbs, door sensors, and a host of other popular Zigbee devices sans a secondary hub. It even has a temperature sensor, just in case you want to turn on your air conditioner or fan via Alexa routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4YrIb"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting a pair&lt;/a&gt; of Echos ahead of Prime Day, knocking $30 off the price of two with offer code &lt;strong&gt;ECHOPRIME &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="407A0B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqGaWV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9qTMwM"&gt;With Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532868/amazon-game-streaming-luna-access-no-invite-prime-day-members"&gt;opening up Luna access&lt;/a&gt; to all Prime subscribers on June 21st and 22nd, now might be your best opportunity to check out Amazon’s answer to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud. Using a dedicated app or browser, the cloud gaming platform is available on pretty much any device you can throw at it — including Windows, Mac, FireTV, iOS, iPadOS, and select Android devices — and offers a way to stream titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus &lt;/em&gt;without a dedicated console or gaming machine. Basic subscriptions run $5.99 a month, though, you can also pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel, which grants you access to a range of Ubisoft titles, including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0KHof"&gt;We found the service to be hit or miss in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;initial review&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller for $49&lt;/a&gt; as part of its early Prime Day deals, making the lack of titles far more palatable. You can also purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle with a Fire TV Stick for $74&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KT9XY9Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;phone clip for $82&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to attach your phone directly to the Luna Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vEOXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606997"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOhmCy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BZzTsE"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television certainly doesn’t offer the kind of picture afforded by today’s best OLEDs, but it’s hard to find a Fire TV Edition model that supports HDR10, a feature that allows for better brightness, color accuracy, and contrast. Insignia’s 4K TV also supports HDMI ARC and HDMI eARC, meaning you can utilize a single cable to send audio from a compatible soundbar or receiver to your TV, and features Amazon’s Fire TV software, allowing you to access Prime Video, Netflix, and a slew of popular streaming services without a standalone streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZi8EO"&gt;As of this week, Insignia’s 4K Fire TV Edition model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen yet on the 55-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pj5QuH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gLz8Bs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audible Premium Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuUbyq"&gt;If you’re an audiobook fan, it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s audiobook service, Audible. Its catalog spans more than 200,000 ad-free titles, and it's peppered with exclusives and originals, some of which come in the form of podcasts and guided wellness programs. A monthly subscription to Audible Premium Plus provides you with one credit a month, which can be redeemed for any premium audiobook in Amazon’s catalog, regardless of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG7MNG"&gt;Audible Premium Plus subscriptions typically run $15 a month, however, now through Prime Day, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe for $7 a month&lt;/a&gt; for the first four months, after which the subscription rate will automatically revert to the standard rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue1uCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wwc6RJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Enw9zU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
