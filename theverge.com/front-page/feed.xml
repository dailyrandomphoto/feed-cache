    <title>Apple adds a way to speed up searches on the App Store by suggesting words</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84pK6Ff1OVJoG3QqhzZ_U6t_s4=/266x0:1129x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208989/Image_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qFFjoR"&gt;Apple has added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?s=20"&gt;a new App Store search suggestions feature&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, that might make it easier to find apps. Now, after typing in a search term, the App Store will attempt to predict what you’re looking for and offer suggested words that, when tapped, will further narrow down your search results and speed up your hunt for specific kinds of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlpL1h"&gt;Search suggestions actually appeared on some iPhones earlier in April as part of a test, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/"&gt;according to MacRumors&lt;/a&gt;, but now the feature should be rolling out to all iPhones in the supported regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vzex1Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Introducing search suggestions on the App Store!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Select (or deselect) multiple suggestions to refine your search so you can find even more amazing apps and games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Search suggestions roll out today starting with the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. &lt;a href="https://t.co/viaZHlCZMb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/viaZHlCZMb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— App Store (@AppStore) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahMf2E"&gt;Using search suggestions is pretty simple. Let’s say I’m looking for an app to help me make some pizza from scratch: I can type “pizza” in the App Store’s search field and see additional words pop up like “maker,” “game,” “call,” “calculator,” or “order.” Selecting one of those suggestions filters the results further, so choosing calculator will pull up apps for calculating the correct ratio ingredients for pizza dough (surprisingly there’s a lot of those). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCpMupZchS3unTOR5WbablRSkHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479656/Image_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunting for “pizza calculators” using the new App Store search suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bTN0i6"&gt;Currently, not every search allows you to select multiple suggestions. I was able to refine Apple’s example of “food” with “delivery” and “Indian,” but my other sample searches only gave me one filter each. Not every search brings up a suggested filter, either. We’ve reached out to Apple for clarification on when suggestions appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3J5PB"&gt;What does consistently show up in search are ads, which Apple originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13184346/apple-app-store-ads"&gt;added to App Store search in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to see how my plan to make pizza from scratch could get derailed by a big Uber Eats or Papa John’s ad above my helpful dough calculator app. Ordering delivery is so much easier than doing math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45Z4KY"&gt;Those ads are likely to inflame Apple’s App Store critics further — they’ll no doubt argue that an indie developer trying to make it easier to figure out the ratios of water to flour in pizza shouldn’t have to compete with Uber’s ad budget, the same way &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?s=20"&gt;they think competing apps shouldn’t be buying ads in front of one another’s products&lt;/a&gt; while Apple profits from the result. But every change to a search engine has winners and losers, and it’s not yet clear whether this one will make it easier or harder for small developers to get more exposure. They could wind up being helpful for everyone who uses the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWHHB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games v. Apple: the fight for the future of the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RicCkIxRkoBro3EhEkKhuc-Xz_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208985/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All the news about the huge trial&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NIDuFm"&gt;After months of preparation, Epic Games will finally take on Apple in court in a trial that could fundamentally change the makeup of the App Store. The fight dates back to August, when Epic added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;direct payment mechanism&lt;/a&gt; to its hit battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in violation of Apple’s rules. The iPhone maker quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic responded shortly after with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; aiming to establish the App Store as a monopoly. The case will finally be brought to trial starting May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C56NR"&gt;The trial promises to deliver huge revelations about the inner workings of one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;with testimony&lt;/a&gt; from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Phil Schiller, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, and more. We’ve already made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;fascinating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;discoveries&lt;/a&gt; from documents published ahead of the trial, and there’s sure to be a lot more news ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoXeg2"&gt;You can follow along with everything right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reveals how Halo Infinite will look on 32:9 super ultrawide monitors and other PC perks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25jdpS3_pbawHfPmTWnzWWZ6MOk=/293x0:3548x2170/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208870/halo_infinite_32_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I wish I’d had this to test with Samsung’s Odyssey G9&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eq9aV4"&gt;Microsoft has something of a history of neglecting PC gaming, but it’s trying to change that in a big way — by promising its flagship &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;will feel like a native PC game when it arrives later this year. We’ve known for many months that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21364626/xbox-series-x-pc-game-pass-xcloud-strategy"&gt;it wouldn’t be the Xbox Series X’s killer app&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft’s trying to make PC gamers feel like first-class citizens too, with features as forward-looking as support for 32:9 super-ultrawide monitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the Samsung Odyssey G9 I reviewed late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzzBzs"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409334/halo-infinite-crossplay-cross-progression-xbox-pc"&gt;we learned the game would support ultrawide monitors&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to triple-keybinds, advanced graphics options, and both crossplay and cross-progression between Xbox and Windows PCs. But this evening, &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-april-2021"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Halo Waypoint&lt;/em&gt; blog went way deeper&lt;/a&gt;, revealing what &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; will look like at 32:9 and an array of other PC-gamer-friendly details like being able to adjust your field of view up to 120 degrees — and the ability to host your own LAN multiplayer server!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhfhbNV7_sROGyUkyhRV_zfAP3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479784/halo_infinite_32_9_003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jgk7X0"&gt;In my Samsung Odyssey G9 review, I bemoaned how even the games that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support 32:9 typically look abnormally, wildly stretched out on each side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;providing over a dozen examples&lt;/a&gt; of how they don’t properly adjust the shape and curvature of the window they’re opening into the 3D game world. But &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; PC development lead Mike Romero says the game’s designed to support arbitrary window sizes, and can fit its HUD, menus, and even in-game cutscenes into the wider aspect ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gm3b63hwxUTcnL1S27cKnDVg--4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479797/halo_infinite_32_9_005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EcparD"&gt;“There’s dozens of people across the studio that have had to put dedicated effort into supporting something like ultrawide throughout the entirety of the game, and I’m very excited to say I think we’ll have some of the best ultrawide support I’ve ever seen in a game,” boasts Romero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7tLXL"&gt;Looking at these &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;images at 32:9, it’s not immediately clear to me that Microsoft has solved the 32:9 issue — looking at the hill on the right of this image below, for instance, it seems like the game world still might appear a little bit skewed and warped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coEBGFvbXyz2D40fGDyDJDXa-ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479789/halo_infinite_32_9_006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls7wgt"&gt;But it is clear that you’ll see a lot more of the game world at once this way, if you’re one of the few who’ve ascended to an ultrawide monitor — and have a PC powerful enough to drive it, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSrnfTTeKEUzTOiNP2L4QOS6Wt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479795/halo_infinite_32_9_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rll32H"&gt;Here’s a short list of all the PC-esque perks Microsoft is promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fMAZjg"&gt;LAN play, hosting a local multiplayer server on PC that you can join from both PC and Xbox &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1ThHcF"&gt;Crossplay, restricting ranked matches to input type rather than console vs. PC, with server-side anti-cheat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f0gJBy"&gt;Adjustable FOV (up to 120 degrees) on both PC and console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WzXoY4"&gt;Mouse and keyboard support on both PC and console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b080kx"&gt;Triple keyboard and mouse bindings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="szE50I"&gt;Visual quality settings up to ultra presets on PC, with individual settings for texture quality, depth of field, anti-aliasing etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8lSq3R"&gt;High refresh rate options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aum5A8"&gt;21:9, 32:9 “and beyond” ultrawide monitor support on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jNmNbZ"&gt;Minimum and maximum framerate settings on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5vGJYS"&gt;Fixed and dynamic resolution scaling options on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i7wPlg"&gt;Optional borderless fullscreen on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mo4hM4"&gt;FPS and ping overlay on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SVOSei"&gt;Out-of-game multiplayer invites let you join games through Xbox Live, Discord and Steam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EhwCPN"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387908351074394117"&gt;my colleague Tom Warren notes&lt;/a&gt;, there’s still more to learn, like whether the game will support GPU-dependent features on PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"&gt;like Nvidia’s framerate-enhancing DLSS&lt;/a&gt;, ray tracing, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is finally coming to PS4 and PS5, three years after its 2018 debut</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHK0Tn"&gt;The hit social deduction game &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 sometime this year, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/29/grab-your-crew-among-us-drops-on-ps4-and-ps5-this-year/"&gt;Sony announced during its State of Play presentation on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRqU6M"&gt;Like on other platforms, the game will support crossplay and online multiplayer so that you can play with your friends no matter what platform you’re on. But PlayStation players will be the only ones who can get exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics: a skin and hat to dress up like Ratchet and a pet that is an adorable little Clank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PljCNx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWVHnP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; blew up last year on PC and mobile devices, eventually becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;, but the game didn’t debut on consoles until a surprise release on Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. Two days after, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;Microsoft confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the game would be hitting Xbox consoles sometime in 2021, and now, we know it’s on the way for PlayStation consoles, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeXKDj"&gt;Sony also showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22406719/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-state-of-play-sony-insomniac-games-playstation-5"&gt;16 minutes of stunning gameplay&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;during Thursday’s show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s widest plane nails ‘extremely successful’ second test flight</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stratolaunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwIUCN"&gt;Stratolaunch, the aerospace firm founded by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, flew its behemoth carrier airplane named ‘Roc’ on Thursday for a second time. It was the company’s first flight under new ownership, coming two years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/4/13/18309129/stratolaunch-worlds-biggest-airplane-first-flight-rockets"&gt;twin-fuselage craft’s initial flight test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5CG0P"&gt;“Today’s flight, at first review, has appeared extremely successful,” Stratolaunch’s chief operating officer Zachary Krevor told reporters in a call on Thursday. “We accomplished all test points as desired, we have not seen anything anomalous, and we are very pleased with the condition of the aircraft upon landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXiWVk"&gt;Roc’s wheels were up at 10:30AM ET, and the plane reached a peak altitude of 2.6 miles over the Mojave Desert in California, Stratolaunch wrote in a press release. The flight, powered by six engines, lasted three hours and 14 minutes before Roc touched down on a gigantic runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The flight lasted longer than its first outing in 2019, but the craft flew slightly lower. One side of the plane landed just before the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRoFmz"&gt;“The air crew did an excellent job of bringing the aircraft down according to our expected crosswind procedures,” Krevor said. Roc’s test flight was designed to see how the plane handles cabin pressurization, and test safety features and some new hardware upgrades since its last test flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NoExOS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Touchdown!! Successful flight tests to round out the day. What a beautiful sight. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gdssjvoN8x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gdssjvoN8x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stratolaunch (@Stratolaunch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stratolaunch/status/1387826410463531009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDLOdW"&gt;The carrier plane’s wingspan is 385 feet — nearly twice the width of a Boeing 747, making it the world’s largest aircraft by wingspan. It’s designed to eventually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;carry Stratolaunch’s fully reusable and autonomous Talon-A hypersonic vehicle — a rocket-powered, jet-shaped craft measuring 28 feet long and 14 feet wide that is designed to serve as a hypersonic testbed for the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZYolc"&gt;Once deployed, Talon A will ignite its liquid-fueled rocket engine to boost itself higher in Earth’s atmosphere for roughly a minute of hypersonic flight test conditions. It glides back for an autonomous landing on a conventional runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFnzmM"&gt;No such Talon-A was on board Roc for Thursday’s test flight, however. The company’s chief technology officer, Daniel Millman, told reporters that Roc will soar higher and faster in test flights over the next year until it can prove itself capable of hitting the right flight conditions required to drop Talon-A. “That will happen later in the year,” Millman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpZ9ra"&gt;Stratolaunch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189377/stratolaunch-scaling-back-operations-medium-launch-vehicle-rocket-layoffs-paul-allen-death"&gt;scaled back operations&lt;/a&gt;, laid off most of its employees and axed plans for a fleet of air-launched rockets following the death of its billionaire founder Paul Allen in October 2018. The company kept enough employees on board to manage the carrier aircraft’s debut flight, which occurred in April 2019. Stratolaunch went dark for more than a year after that. It eventually &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/exclusive-buyer-paul-allens-stratolaunch-space-venture-secretive-trump-ally/?fbclid=IwAR2tli4rU9aPZTnzSzR8gISWd12ovW2BD5_WzOKbtObKT1zgoXX9p2IFl38"&gt;found new funding&lt;/a&gt; and rehired some employees to revive its carrier plane test program and refocus its business on hypersonic testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9D4wV"&gt;Today’s flight of Roc, named after the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)"&gt;large and legendary&lt;/a&gt; bird of prey in Middle Eastern mythology, was the culmination of that revival. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon crosses $100 billion in sales in huge first quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxyr5eelCjz9Fbtfz2GbsJXsTqs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208089/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qz6lEP"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;had a wildly successful 2020&lt;/a&gt;, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and that blazing trail shows no signs of stopping for 2021. The company shared its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;financial results for Q1 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it brought in $108.5 billion in net sales. That’s a 44 percent increase from the $75.5 billion reported in the first quarter of last year, as the pandemic was beginning to take hold globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6DMDn"&gt;Its profits have exploded year-over-year, as well, increasing to $8.1 billion in the first quarter of this year. At this time in 2020, the figure reported was a &lt;em&gt;meager &lt;/em&gt;$2.5 billion. Amazon expects to continue crossing the $100 billion net sales mark next quarter with the figure ultimately landing somewhere between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR256L"&gt;But as Amazon’s sales have grown, it has also grown more concerned with government intervention. Its @AmazonNews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;made the bizarre decision to troll US Congress members&lt;/a&gt; about tax laws. The account also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;publicly disputed reports that some of Amazon’s workers pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; to meet company goals, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;then later apologized&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) for a tweet saying &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359"&gt;“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHl53X"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos shared his final annual letter to investors recently, highlighting the fact that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;Amazon Prime subscribers had grown to 200 million people&lt;/a&gt;, up approximately 33 percent from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115823/amazon-q4-19-earnings-prime-membership-fresh-one-day-shipping"&gt;its previous milestone of 150 million subscribers in Q4 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3aYrZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;Bezos will be replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; in Q3 2021, and he’ll be taking the reins of a seemingly unstoppable force that can turn huge sales and profit during tough times. He’ll also be taking on a swath of big issues that the company currently faces, notably unionization. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;a failed union vote&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;a fired worker is attempting to unionize other Amazon warehouse facilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart looks incredible in 16 minutes of new gameplay footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U5XUp9xrbnV056UMbzKT__4SUBo=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207968/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_2.22.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Insomniac Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WPNJ4"&gt;Sony and Insomniac Games debuted 16 minutes of stunning new &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; gameplay footage in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4Zf1GCFoqn0"&gt;a new State of Play presentation&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpMqUB"&gt;For part of the video, protagonist Ratchet traversed through a new town called Nefarious City that was packed with detail — it reminded me of a &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; version of Star Wars’ Coruscant. There was a lot of classic &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; gameplay on display, with 3D platforming and crates to smash for screws, but the developers have also added new moves to give you added mobility. There’s now dashing and wall running, for example, and you can also use the new Rift Tether to hook into portals so you can zip from place to place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8YRoCI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"A Lombax? What is this place?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Ratchet as he searches for clues in this extended look at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RatchetPS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RatchetPS5&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from State of Play: &lt;a href="https://t.co/sSGXRYz3fk"&gt;https://t.co/sSGXRYz3fk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OmaoVJcrrf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OmaoVJcrrf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1387882693728227331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrRPa"&gt;Another part of the video &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/26/meet-rivet-the-mysterious-new-protagonist-in-ratchet-clank-rift-apart/"&gt;starred Rivet&lt;/a&gt;, a new Lombax resistance fighter that lives in a different dimension than Ratchet and Clank’s. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1386787174964600834"&gt;She’s voiced by Jennifer Hale&lt;/a&gt;, known for her roles in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vj7M1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; will take advantage of the DualSense’s adaptive triggers to offer different actions for your guns based on how far you pull the trigger. Sony also showed off some new weapons, like the Shatterbomb, which launched grenade-like bombs at oncoming baddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKvpn"&gt;The game looks great, and fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to play it — &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; will be out on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUuSTL"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8hWEhS7iw0"&gt;State of Play show&lt;/a&gt;, Sony also revealed that &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/29/grab-your-crew-among-us-drops-on-ps4-and-ps5-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is hitting PS4 and PS5 in 2021&lt;/a&gt; and showed off new footage of &lt;em&gt;Subnautica: Below Zero, &lt;/em&gt;which launches on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google updates latest Chromecast with more HDR controls and improved Wi-Fi performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGnatIyUapoHAZ9CA0CzT_wxbJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207919/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCAl5U"&gt;Google is rolling out a new April update for the Chromecast with Google TV that launched last year. It’s a fairly large update for a streaming device — totaling 166MB on my Chromecast — but includes numerous improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npv13Q"&gt;Once you’ve installed the new software and restarted your Chromecast, you’ll be able to dig a little deeper into video settings than was previously possible. In the new “advanced video controls” area of settings, you’re now given the ability to choose your preferred dynamic range format. Options include Dolby Vision, HDR, or even SDR if you want to keep it there. You can also manually switch to a ton of resolutions at various refresh rates from this menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="36yUeg"&gt;4K (60Hz / 50Hz / 30Hz/ 25Hz / 24Hz / smpte)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t5QhTy"&gt;1080p (60Hz / 50Hz / 24Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Eo1bHR"&gt;720p (60Hz / 50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GaoEVx"&gt;1080i (60Hz / 50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FILvNX"&gt;576p (50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ofU89h"&gt;480p (60Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="p8NXhg"&gt;Unless you’ve got a good reason to make a change, I’d keep it at whatever Chromecast selects as the default: that was 4K 60Hz in my case. Google says this update also improves the Chromecast with Google TV’s Wi-Fi performance on 5GHz networks and mesh systems. For the full list of improvements, see below. I’m still waiting for a way to clear the “continue watching” row, where shows and movies can sometimes just get stuck — even after you’ve finished streaming them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RlDCkK"&gt;- Advanced Video Controls setting for granular HDR formats, resolution/refresh rate, and color formats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgczXM"&gt;- HDMI hotplug improvements helping your Chromecast detect the best TV Settings available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoUsnh"&gt;- Wi-Fi Improvements for 5Ghz and Mesh networks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0A2MBj"&gt;- Bluetooth Audio stuttering improvements in some Apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFs42u"&gt;- HDMI-CEC can now be configured to turn on/off only the TV in settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBzt9I"&gt;- Security update: Android security patch level to April 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9xMkE"&gt;Separate from this software update, the Chromecast with Google TV also recently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/chromecast-with-google-tv-supports-hdr10-plus/"&gt;picked up certification for HDR10+&lt;/a&gt;. So if you come across content on Amazon Prime Video that streams in that format of HDR, it should soon be supported on Google’s streaming gadget.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Dexter creepily smile again in the first teaser trailer for his new Showtime series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WqFnzDC4zYyPNChba7z-AbMTjQ=/0x0:1293x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207812/dexter_screenshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NytOpQ"&gt;Years ago, my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues convinced me that &lt;em&gt;Dexter &lt;/em&gt;got so bad, it’d be a waste of my time to see my favorite TV serial killer reach the end of his story — so when I tell you that &lt;em&gt;Dexter&lt;/em&gt;’s coming back this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22410014/dexter-limited-series-showtime-teaser-misunderstood"&gt;picking up right where the show left off&lt;/a&gt;, I have&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;absolutely no clue what that actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWIh11"&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; emotionally invest yourself enough to see the series through, you have my pity, my respect, and a brand-new teaser trailer to watch, above, as proof of life — an assurance that the series’ widely panned ending isn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGzd8z"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Dexter&lt;/em&gt; will be a 10-episode limited series on Showtime this fall, starring Michael C. Hall, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dexter-revival-enlists-director-marcos-siega-exclusive"&gt;set 10 years after the original show&lt;/a&gt;, created by the original showrunner and featuring one of the original directors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOL4vr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The math isn’t adding up on forests and CO2 reductions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Upward view of giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park,..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13ml-ewiUPo2s9fS806Kmqrek1U=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207802/1042402326.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rU6eKQ"&gt;More evidence surfaced this week that shows that forests are struggling to do humans’ dirty work when it comes to climate change. Although companies and countries are increasingly relying on forests to draw down their planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, the math isn’t adding up to show big benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne6Rup"&gt;California might have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;oversold the success of carbon offsets used in its cap-and-trade system, which is often billed as one of the world’s most successful market-based mechanisms to tackle climate change. The system appears to be failing because California is actually overcounting how much carbon dioxide forests keep out of the atmosphere, according to a new &lt;a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets-explainer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by nonprofit CarbonPlan, that’s still under peer review, and reporting by &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-solution-actually-adding-millions-of-tons-of-co2-into-the-atmosphere"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (One of the authors, James Temple, was previously a senior director at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSnmbS"&gt;That finding follows research published earlier this week in the journal &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41558-021-01033-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22410367%2Fforest-offsets-trees-carbon-dioxide-accounting" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found a giant discrepancy between how much climate pollution countries officially reported and how much pollution independent models calculated for them. In this case, forests mucked up the numbers because countries are attributing more carbon reductions to their forests than independent models do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vpt6Eb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That lets those polluters off the hook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S9xccC"&gt;Trees do provide a crucial service for people and the planet by “breathing in” and storing carbon dioxide. So protecting forests is important for their health and ours. But schemes devised to sell forests’ carbon storage to polluters as a way to cancel out their emissions haven’t always resulted in the CO2 reductions they’re supposed to achieve. Ultimately, that lets those polluters off the hook instead of pushing them to do more in the race to prevent a deeper climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycjZWZ"&gt;In the US, forest owners can sell their land’s ability to store carbon as “credits” to polluters. Since California sets a cap for how much CO2 pollution industries generate, companies can purchase those credits to cancel out some of their emissions and stay below the cap (with each credit representing one metric ton of CO2). But up to 39 million credits, nearly a third in the state’s program, didn’t actually provide the climate benefits they were supposed to, according to the new analysis by CarbonPlan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKS9Fj"&gt;That’s because the state was using averages to estimate how much CO2 each parcel of forest could hold. In reality, some pieces of forest can store more than others based on what kinds of trees are there and how dense the forest is. Forest managers also “gamed the system” by selling credits from parcels that inflated how much carbon they stored, &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NTF2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forest managers also “gamed the system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtJaIJ"&gt;The California Air Resources Board disputes the study’s findings, which are still undergoing peer review. “We were not given sufficient time to fully analyze an unpublished study and are not commenting further on the authors’ alternative methodology,” a spokesperson for the Air Resources Board wrote to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. (This isn’t the first time California’s cap-and-trade system has come under scrutiny. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/how-california-can-make-its-cap-and-trade-program-more-equitable/"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that some “economically disadvantaged neighborhoods” near regulated facilities experienced higher rates of pollution after the carbon trading system began.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhjJ7J"&gt;Discrepancies in carbon accounting due to forests show up globally, too, according to the &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; study. There was a 5.5 billion ton difference between the amount of carbon dioxide emissions nations report each year and what independent models calculated. That’s a big gap, nearly as much as the US’s net emissions in 2019. It boils down to the way the US and other countries count up carbon caught by their forests, which doesn’t match up with the methods other researchers use. The lack of standardized reporting across the board for countries and scientists could throw a wrench in global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It’s hard to make progress if everyone’s taking different measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QytwC3"&gt;What’s more, countries that are big polluters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that have a lot of forests, like the US, can lean on that asset more than countries without as much forest cover, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/26/greenhouse-accounting-problem/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes. Countries like the US use forests to subtract emissions, and they end up reporting a smaller “net” footprint as a result. That can make it look like they’ve made bigger environmental gains even if they’re still polluting a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pigb1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A freebie from nature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DU9jZ9"&gt;If the US didn’t count on forests and other land ecosystems to offset some 12 percent of its emissions, its carbon footprint would actually be much higher. “We are lucky to have those natural carbon sinks,” Christopher Williams, a professor at Clark University, told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. “However, that carbon uptake is a freebie from nature for which we do not really get to take credit in our battle against climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dL3Hd"&gt;Despite the risks that come with relying on those freebies, it’s getting trendier than ever to invest in forest-based climate solutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932700/youtubers-climate-change-team-trees"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; have launched feel-good tree-planting initiatives. Tech companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that have made commitments to become carbon “neutral” or carbon “negative” say that they’ll draw down at least as many emissions as they release — and are relying heavily on trees to do that. But trees can only do so much — and, if the results of these studies hold up, perhaps much less than people previously thought they could. &lt;/p&gt;
