    <title>WHO outlines principles for ethics in health AI</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8xdBzy"&gt;The World Health Organization released a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240029200"&gt;guidance document&lt;/a&gt; outlining six key principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence in health. Twenty experts spent two years developing the guidance, which marks the first consensus report on AI ethics in healthcare settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl8zEy"&gt;The report highlights the promise of health AI, and its potential to help doctors treat patients — particularly in under-resourced areas. But it also stresses that technology is not a quick fix for health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and that governments and regulators should carefully scrutinize where and how AI is used in health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlSYmD"&gt;The WHO said it hopes the six principles can be the foundation for how governments, developers, and regulators approach the technology. The six principles its experts came up with are: protecting autonomy; promoting human safety and well-being; ensuring transparency; fostering accountability; ensuring equity; and promoting tools that are responsive and sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YXjHb"&gt;There are dozens of potential ways AI can be used in healthcare. There are applications in development that use AI to screen medical images like mammograms, tools that scan patient health records to predict if they might get sicker, devices that help people monitor their own health, and systems that help track disease outbreaks. In areas where people don’t have access to specialist doctors, tools could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0629-6"&gt;help evaluate&lt;/a&gt; symptoms. But when they’re not developed and implemented carefully, they can — at best — not live up to their promise. At worst, they can cause harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1MEo"&gt;Some of the pitfalls were clear during the past year. In the scramble to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare institutions and governments turned to AI tools for solutions. Many of those tools, though, had some of the features the WHO report warns against. In Singapore, the government admitted that a contact tracing application collected data that could also be used in criminal investigations — an example of “function creep,” where health data was repurposed beyond the original goal. Most AI programs that aimed to detect COVID-19 based on chest scans were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00307-0"&gt;based on poor data&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t end up being useful. Hospitals in the United States used an algorithm designed to predict which COVID-19 patients might need intensive care &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2021/05/27/health-care-algorithm-promise-peril/"&gt;before the program was tested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SIp5XH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“An emergency does not justify deployment of unproven technologies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0GRQJ9"&gt;“An emergency does not justify deployment of unproven technologies,” the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHFVOx"&gt;The report also recognized that many AI tools are developed by large, private technology companies (like Google and Chinese company Tencent) or by partnerships between the public and private sector. Those companies have the resources and data to build these tools, but may not have incentives to adopt the proposed ethical framework for their own products. Their focus may be toward profit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22514951/pandemic-public-health-solutions-google-apple-facebook"&gt;rather than the public good&lt;/a&gt;. “While these companies may offer innovative approaches, there is concern that they might eventually exercise too much power in relation to governments, providers and patients,” the report reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS3eSJ"&gt;AI technology in healthcare is still new, and many governments, regulators, and health systems are still figuring out how to evaluate and manage them. Being thoughtful and measured in the approach will help avoid potential harm, the WHO report said. “The appeal of technological solutions and the promise of technology can lead to overestimation of the benefits and dismissal of the challenges and problems that new technologies such as AI may introduce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="d5QkOs"&gt;
&lt;p id="nApHoO"&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the six ethical principles in the WHO guidance and why they matter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6FuAqL"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Protect autonomy:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans should have oversight of and the final say on all health decisions — they shouldn’t be made entirely by machines, and doctors should be able to override them at any time. AI shouldn’t be used to guide someone’s medical care without their consent, and their data should be protected. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YJ9yBM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Promote human safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers should continuously monitor any AI tools to make sure they’re working as they’re supposed to and not causing harm. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5wWZAn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ensure transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers should publish information about the design of AI tools. One regular criticism of the systems is that they’re &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2019/12/04/black-box-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;“black boxes,”&lt;/a&gt; and it’s too hard for researchers and doctors to know how they make decisions. The WHO wants to see enough transparency that they can be fully audited and understood by users and regulators. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CreKtn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Foster accountability&lt;/strong&gt;: When something goes wrong with an AI technology — like if a decision made by a tool leads to patient harm — there should be mechanisms determining who is responsible (like manufacturers and clinical users).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pqofhy"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ensure equity:&lt;/strong&gt; That means making sure tools are available in multiple languages, that they’re trained on diverse sets of data. In the past few years, close scrutiny of common health algorithms has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;some have racial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995178/racial-bias-health-care-algorithms-cory-booker-senator-wyden"&gt;bias&lt;/a&gt; built in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Cwd6RS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Promote AI that is sustainable:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers should be able to regularly update their tools, and institutions should have ways to adjust if a tool seems ineffective. Institutions or companies should also only introduce tools that can be repaired, even in under-resourced health systems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vbKYUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Onc7aDdjRRR6knxYhMJrqsbo55k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524342/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5OHuj"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Google have announced that all Android phones on the network will use Google’s Android Messages app for SMS and RCS services. T-Mobile made the exact same partnership deal with Google in March, which leaves Verizon as the only US carrier who hasn’t committed to switching its customers to Android Messages by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxk7X0"&gt;Along with the switch to Messages comes another important shift: real interoperability with RCS on other networks. AT&amp;amp;T has supported RCS for awhile now, but that support has been as haphazard as it was half-hearted. The new deal also means that AT&amp;amp;T customers will benefit from the rollout of end-to-end encryption for RCS that Google is rolling out to all customers this year (that rollout has already begun, in fact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U49JPZ"&gt;Google has been pushing RCS as its default texting solution for Android for some time now, touting it as an open standard that any carrier can easily adopt as the next generation of SMS. RCS has a lot of advantages over SMS: there are no character limits, it can send larger files, it can show typing indicators, offer better group chats, Wi-Fi support, and offer end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NwciLa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it’s confusing — blame Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YJUsec"&gt;When Android Messages detects that you’re texting with another phone that supports RCS, your text entry window will switch to say that you are sending a “Chat” and that you have “Chat features” enabled. This is not the same thing as Google Chat, the company’s other messaging service. Yes, it’s confusing — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;blame Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jv8BwT"&gt;In any case, despite Google’s best efforts, carriers were slow to adopt RCS. In fact, in October 2019 they announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;doomed attempt to form an RCS consortium&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382715/us-carriers-ccmi-rcs-abandoned-sms-messages-texts"&gt;went nowhere&lt;/a&gt;. Google eventually had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271186/google-rcs-t-mobile-encryption-ccmi-universal-profile"&gt;take matters into its own hands&lt;/a&gt;, years into an overlong transition by offering RCS services directly to any Android user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NBVjq"&gt;In all, the RCS Chat rollout has been a huge mess because of politics, corporate fights, and plain old confusing Google messaging app strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2entOW"&gt;Now, with these carrier deals, Google has gone one step further to make it a true default. Unfortunately, it’s just a step. Verizon will need to get on board, too, as will another big company: Apple. The iPhone does not support RCS and Apple has yet to make a peep about whether it will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent taps Blizzard veterans to make ‘the next great PC RTS’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owVCdFmzTR10UV3TVK--U-Y1mZ4=/0x15:1200x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524338/PUBG_Mobile.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile is currently one of Tencent’s biggest titles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tencent Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4pDqk7"&gt;Tencent’s sprawling games empire just grew one studio bigger. Uncapped Games is a new Los Angeles-based studio led by Blizzard veterans Jason Hughes and David Kim. Hughes is serving as the studio’s lead producer and has previously worked on &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;IV&lt;/em&gt;, while Kim is its lead designer and has previously worked on &lt;em&gt;StarCraft 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mejLkT"&gt;The new studio’s focus will be on real-time strategy (RTS) games, with a focus on creating the “next great PC RTS,” Kim says. Although the RTS genre has remained consistently popular over the years, it continues to be dominated by ‘90s franchises like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Command and Conquer&lt;/em&gt;. A fresh entry to the genre would be no bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BXQHWJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Making the next great PC RTS has been my goal for almost a decade now”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vbm4KM"&gt;“Making the next great PC RTS has been my goal for almost a decade now, and Lightspeed and Quantum is giving us an awesome shot at making that,” said Kim. “Putting together a team of great developers with lots of experience and being backed by the right people who also believe in RTS as much as we do is our first big step in getting there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soVAr5"&gt;Uncapped Games joins a huge roster of studios under Tencent Games. Uncapped sits under the company’s Lightspeed and Quantum Studios Group, which is best known as the developer of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and which encompasses the studios Quantum, Anyplay, Tiki, and Lightspeed LA. But Lightspeed and Quantum Studios is &lt;em&gt;itself &lt;/em&gt;just one of the four game studios under Tencent Games alongside TiMi Studios (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;developers of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Aurora Studio, and Morefun Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vEWXJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgNNdD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren calls for investigation of Google’s ‘Project Bernanke’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R1lgxfb_Tu0GLtYo3OPplV1fKjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524158/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdUOkJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691175/Letter_to_CFTC_re_Google_Project_Bernanke__Warren_.pdf"&gt;a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CFTC) on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called for an investigation of Google’s alleged manipulation of the marketplace for online ads, opening the door for a new federal regulator for digital advertising markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO3mNu"&gt;Warren’s letter focuses on a program called “Project Bernanke,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378296/google-secret-project-bernanke-ad-buying-competitors-texas"&gt;revealed in April&lt;/a&gt; as part of a lawsuit against Google led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Under that program, Google allegedly used historical Google Ads data to boost clients’ chances of winning auctions. The practice allegedly resulted in $230 million in additional revenue for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XudpxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The market for digital advertising has become perhaps the most actively traded commodity exchange in the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GxpXVq"&gt;“Because Google was able to learn from rival ad buyers’ previous bidding data, its ad-buying tools gained a competitive advantage that ultimately boosted their win rates,” Warren writes in the letter. “While are investigating this activity for potential violations of the antitrust laws, the activity raises additional concerns that I believe may be within the CFTC’s jurisdiction and warrant close scrutiny.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvbdfW"&gt;Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said the claims of market manipulation were a mischaracterization of a simple product feature. “This was entirely implemented by Google Ads for buyers, using the kinds of data and strategies that are available to any buyer participating in an Ad Exchange auction,” the company said. “Like many other businesses in this highly competitive field, we constantly work to improve our products and compete more effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j32zPX"&gt;Often overlooked in favor of splashier sidelines, online ad markets have long been the core of Google’s business. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22404046/google-alphabet-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;In its most recent quarterly earnings&lt;/a&gt;, the company reported more than $44 billion in advertising revenue, making up more than 80 percent of the company’s overall revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXM59W"&gt;Digital ad exchanges would be a new target for the CFTC, which has conventionally dealt with commodity trading and (more recently) cryptocurrency. But Warren argues that digital ads fall within the statutory definition of a commodity, and that CFTC regulation of the markets would not preempt other agencies from taking action. If the commission takes up Warren’s call to action, it would be a significant expansion of its powers — and a significant new headache for Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayzvhx"&gt;“Like high-frequency traders, ad exchanges provide in real time a platform for the sale of ad inventory each time a web page loads,” Warren writes. “Tens of billions of digital ads are traded on ad exchanges every day in the US. The market for digital advertising has become perhaps the most actively traded commodity exchange in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0yg55"&gt;The letter comes at an uncertain time for the CFTC, which is still awaiting new leadership from the Biden administration. Georgetown professor and former CFTC commissioner Chris Brummer has been suggested as a frontrunner to lead the agency. But Brummer has yet to face Senate confirmation, where Sen. Warren’s hopes for the agency could be addressed directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The auto industry is distancing itself from Tesla in response to new crash reporting rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/itH-0pCQ2re7_CbYZHJzXbo2Ssc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524150/jbareham_180213_2301_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GvsdjQ"&gt;The auto industry is holding its fire — for now — over the new requirement to report crashes involving vehicles equipped with partially and fully autonomous driving systems. But automakers are also distancing themselves from the company that appears to be the primary target of the new rule: Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJFbHo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555666/nhtsa-autonomous-vehicle-crash-report-data"&gt;The rule&lt;/a&gt;, issued yesterday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, requires companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash, a major change that signals a tougher stance by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLDg3o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;car companies are taking a wait-and-see approach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cpef4h"&gt;So far, car companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, mostly lauding NHTSA’s commitment to safety and transparency, while objecting to the perceived conflation of driver-assistance systems, like Tesla’s Autopilot, with fully autonomous vehicles like those operated by Waymo. While many autonomous vehicles are deployed in states with regulations on the books, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like Tesla’s Autopilot fall in a legal gray area that allowed incidents to escape further examination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MMTNm"&gt;Most of the individual companies declined to comment on the ruling, preferring to speak through the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents all of the major automakers and their suppliers — but notably not Tesla. The alliance released a statement that singled out “misuse and abuse” of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7dBNw"&gt;“As we evaluate NHTSA’s new reporting obligations, it’s critical that consumers know and understand the benefits—and limitations—of these features to build and improve confidence in proven vehicle safety technologies,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president, in a statement. “Misuse and abuse of Level 2 ADAS systems is extremely dangerous and threatens consumer acceptance and confidence in vehicles equipped with potentially life-saving ADAS technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="du6zoc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Misuse and abuse of Level 2 ADAS systems is extremely dangerous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYe2GL"&gt;Bozzella also noted that last April, “automakers representing nearly 99 percent of the new vehicles sold in the US” signed a pledge committing to “effective driver monitoring systems for Level 2 vehicles.” Driver monitoring systems typically rely on in-car cameras to ensure that drivers are watching the road while using driver-assistance systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVmwN8"&gt;Companies like General Motors and Ford currently sell cars with camera-based eye-tracking systems that are meant to make sure drivers pay attention while using hands-free driving features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMnJTK"&gt;But Tesla, which many observers noted seems to be the primary target of this new NHTSA rule, has historically resisted regulatory pressure to add better driver monitoring in its cars. That may be changing, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;The latest software update release&lt;/a&gt; notes imply that Tesla will begin using the camera above the rear-view mirror in the Model 3 and Model Y to help make sure people pay attention to the road while using Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPs9Bi"&gt;But the company hasn’t said anything publicly about this change. And a spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story, which isn’t surprising considering the company has eliminated its public relations department and hasn’t responded to a request for comment in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H627a8"&gt;Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have long been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;criticized for overstating the capabilities&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s Autopilot system, which in its most basic form can center a Tesla vehicle in a lane and around curves and adjust the car’s speed based on the vehicle ahead. The use of brand names like Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” has also helped contribute to an environment in which Tesla customers are misled into believing their vehicles can actually drive themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="37mSoH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has been criticized for overstating the capabilities of Autopilot &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBXoAe"&gt;Since Tesla introduced Autopilot in 2015, there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/"&gt;11 deaths in nine crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the US that involved the driver assistance system. Internationally, there have been at least another nine deaths in seven additional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xMxfu"&gt;The company’s silence is especially notable given the company’s shifting relationship with US regulators. NHTSA, which enforces federal motor vehicle safety standards, has been &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/26455/nhtsas-flawed-autopilot-safety-study-unmasked"&gt;criticized for misrepresenting Autopilot’s safety record&lt;/a&gt; and for giving the company a pass on customers who misuse the technology. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;NHTSA recently disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active. Despite this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384580105649885188"&gt;recently tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “NHTSA is great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4FJT6"&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates crashes involving partially and fully autonomous vehicle crashes, has proven more willing to point fingers at Musk’s company. An NTSB investigation into the 2018 death of a Tesla owner in California said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;Autopilot was partly to blame&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has been much more hostile toward the agency, at one point &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/elon-musk-hung-up-on-ntsb-chief-during-call-about-tesla-crash-probe/"&gt;hanging up on the chairman of NTSB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzLemU"&gt;Another trade group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which represents AV companies including Waymo, Argo, Aurora, Cruise, and others, echoed similar concerns voiced by the legacy auto industry about grouping their vehicles in with Level 2 cars like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOksei"&gt;“Clear national reporting standards can be an important means to increase public understanding of autonomous vehicles,” said Ariel Wolf, general counsel of the group, in a statement. “But there must be a distinction between our members’ autonomous vehicles—which do not require human intervention to operate safely—and driver assistance technology like Tesla’s, which requires an attentive driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNKsZv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Clear national reporting standards can be an important means to increase public understanding of autonomous vehicles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GjQw62"&gt;In his statement, Wolf implied that the NHTSA rule was issued without consulting industry players about what was being required of it. He said that the coalition hopes to “restart ... constructive conversations” with the agency on the work of improving safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60YGSR"&gt;Speaking of safety, auto safety groups lauded the new NHTSA rule requiring crash reporting. Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said the rule will provide NHTSA with the necessary data to “determine the safety of the crash avoidance and automated driving systems,” which the government has previously lacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5uvth"&gt;Chase noted that the rule is especially timely given that legislation currently pending in Congress barely requires any data collection from the private sector. “History and experience have repeatedly shown that voluntary agreements fail to yield accurate, comprehensive and reliable results,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fr3M7e"&gt;Two car companies, Volkswagen and Honda, replied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the new rule. VW, which is working with Argo on autonomous vehicle technology, said it looks forward to “working with NHTSA on the principles underlying the standing order announced today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9bNiy"&gt;Meanwhile, Honda, which has invested in Cruise and helped design the company’s fully driverless shuttle, noted that its current driver-assistance products, AcuraWatch and Honda Sensing, on the sale in the US “are considered Level 1 ADAS. Thus, there is no immediate requirement related to our vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Excalibur is a fan wiki for the best ’70s TV show that never existed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Excalibur, screenshot from “The Oneiromancer”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8d8Ey_d0Hd0sYThOEJ8_4IqreJQ=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69524087/s1e8.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://twitter.com/jjguest_if" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J.J. Guest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://twitter.com/gcbaccaris" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G.C. Baccaris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D6vFHN"&gt;Does anybody else remember &lt;em&gt;Excalibur?&lt;/em&gt; You know, &lt;em&gt;Excalibur:&lt;/em&gt; the British TV show that ran for two seasons in the mid-1970s, mixing Arthurian legend with Aleister Crowley mysticism, interplanetary exploration, an undead (sorry, spoilers!) villain named Poseidon, and a deeply troubled production history? If so, that’s a little weird because it never existed — but if enough people remember it, maybe that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4wTBQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excalibur&lt;/em&gt; is, in fact, &lt;a href="https://j-j-guest.itch.io/excalibur"&gt;an interactive fiction project&lt;/a&gt; made by J. J. Guest, G. C. Baccaris, and Duncan Bowsman. It’s a detailed “fan wiki” for the eponymous (and fictitious) BBC series, and clicking through it reveals layers of in-show plot summaries, behind-the-scenes cast and crew drama, and a running conflict between the wiki’s contributors themselves. Exploring the wiki will slowly unlock new pieces of it, and there’s a simple walkthrough on the “Help” page if you happen to get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSNpe7"&gt;The “lost” BBC project &lt;em&gt;Excalibur &lt;/em&gt;is a trippier mirror of low-budget series like &lt;em&gt;Blake’s 7 —&lt;/em&gt; a short-lived show that profoundly influenced modern-day fandom — and its meta-drama touches on real conflicts like the ethical debate about &lt;a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/RPF"&gt;real person fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYFe7B"&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321816/twine-games-history-legacy-art"&gt;Twine-built&lt;/a&gt; interactive story &lt;em&gt;Excalibur &lt;/em&gt;follows a wiki format you can find in some other hypertext fiction, including the &lt;a href="https://neurocracy.site/"&gt;upcoming murder mystery &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It contrasts the ephemerality of older media with the obsessiveness of online fan culture, exploring that deceptive feeling that the internet puts all knowledge within our reach — like a less ontologically menacing version of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/how-i-used-lies-about-a-cartoon-to-prove-history-is-meaningless-on-the-internet-6c88bcbc62d7"&gt;Jordan Minor’s &lt;em&gt;Street Sharks&lt;/em&gt; prank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT7lvJ"&gt;And on top of it all, I’d definitely watch &lt;em&gt;Excalibur!&lt;/em&gt; Sure, a few too many episodes end with the revelation that reality is an illusion. But “The Sun Stealers” and “A Painted Ocean” (a twist on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conundrum_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)"&gt;famous &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt;) sound &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wing launches free app to help drone pilots obey US regulations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mdyvrf5yZxYPHQNLWyuW-QcPD3A=/161x0:1888x1151/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523827/ForAllDroneFlyers.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OeBviY"&gt;Wing, the drone delivery arm of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has &lt;a href="https://blog.wing.com/2021/06/wing-launches-free-drone-flyer-app.html"&gt;launched a free app&lt;/a&gt; in the US to help pilots fly their drones legally. OpenSky has been available in Australia since 2019 but is now available for both commercial and recreational pilots in the US to use for anything from conducting commercial surveys to filming and photography. It’s available now on both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNhhJl"&gt;OpenSky is based on Google Maps, Wing &lt;a href="https://dronelife.com/2021/06/29/the-wing-free-drone-pilot-app-for-commercial-and-recreational-users-opensky-launches-today/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;DroneLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s color-coded to show areas where pilots can and can’t fly. Green areas are a-okay, but pilots need to exercise caution in yellow areas, and shouldn’t fly at all in red areas. Perhaps its most useful feature is that it lets pilots submit requests to fly in controlled airspace and receive “near real-time authorizations.” The approval process works in airspace that supports Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), which includes “hundreds of air traffic facilities and airports” according to an &lt;a href="https://wing.com/opensky-faq/#is-opensky-an-faa-approved-application?"&gt;FAQ on Wing’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZgMwCbNJFUT4IZg7EURD4xUrAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691068/See_Where_You_Can_and_Cannot_Fly.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenSky show’s where it’s safe to fly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eG8xdz"&gt;As well as checking where it’s legal to fly and request authorization, OpenSky also lets pilots log and plan their flights. The app needs an internet connection to operate, Wing notes, so you’re advised to take a screenshot of a flight approval if you’re going to need it in an area with poor reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJBjRz"&gt;The launch of OpenSky comes as drones are receiving increased amounts of regulation in the US and around the world, as lawmakers catch up with the relatively new technology. Pilots in the US currently have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16768960/new-law-reinstates-small-drone-registration-in-the-us"&gt;register to fly&lt;/a&gt; any drones weighing over 0.55 pounds, and from 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;drones will have to broadcast their location&lt;/a&gt; during flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdp184"&gt;Wing’s argument is that an app like OpenSky makes it easier for pilots to obey the rules and fly the nearly 2 million drones that have been registered in the US. “Compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones—among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery—to more people,” Wing said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsaWbv"&gt;It’s that last point, “contactless delivery,” that’s perhaps most important for Wing, which is best known as a drone delivery business. As well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629239/alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-finland-helsinki-vuosaari-google-air-early-access"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301782/wing-drone-delivery-google-alphabet-canberra-australia-public-launch"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Wing has been making deliveries in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20921310/wings-delivery-drones-virginia-first-flight"&gt;Christiansburg, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;DroneLife&lt;/em&gt;, Wing’s Lia Reich said the company has plans to expand its drone delivery service in the US “later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28AuFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CBGbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Virgin Orbit launch its first commercial mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQt0RbVPrzMMsL-YDCSbrUWCtRk=/0x0:4916x3277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523441/1230643749.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WZZHEp"&gt;Virgin Orbit is in the middle of its debut commercial mission from Southern California, five months after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;first reached orbit during a January test flight&lt;/a&gt;. Seven satellites from three different countries are loaded onto a rocket that blasted off in midair from Virgin Orbit’s modified Boeing 747 less than an hour after the plane departed the Mojave Air and Space Port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFYdK3"&gt;The carrier aircraft, a modified Boeing 747 named Cosmic Girl, took off at 9:53AM ET. Less than an hour later at 10:47AM, a 70-foot-long two-stage rocket called LauncherOne dropped from the plane’s left wing and ignited its single engine to zoom toward the edge of Earth’s atmosphere. The rocket is carrying the Netherlands’ first military satellite, four tiny satellites from a Defense Department test program, and the first two of 14 imaging satellites for SatRevolution’s constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epSfpA"&gt;It will take roughly 40 minutes for the rocket to deploy the satellites into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf9viz"&gt;This is the first mission Virgin Orbit decided to livestream publicly. You can watch the video stream &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgL5pMDktxA&amp;amp;ab_channel=VirginOrbit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. The company also plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirginOrbit"&gt;tweet out updates&lt;/a&gt; during the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7jEpP"&gt;Virgin Orbit calls the mission “Tubular Bells: Part One,” marking its third flight since May 2020 and the debut of its commercial satellite service. That first flight attempt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to reach orbit when an interrupted fuel line caused the rocket to shut down shortly after detaching from Cosmic Girl. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;next attempt in January&lt;/a&gt;, carrying satellite payloads for the first time, was a success and capped Virgin Orbit’s test program. Wednesday’s Tubular Bells mission will be followed by at least one more mission this year, CEO Dan Hart told reporters on a Tuesday call (without providing a specific date for that mission). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwZG2Z"&gt;The missions will precede a much busier launch schedule in 2022. “Now it’s a matter of just continuing to ramp up and moving rockets through integration,” Hart said, expecting six launches in 2022. He added Virgin Orbit signed “quite a few” launch deals after its January test flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cv8nhL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="On board Virgin Orbit’s flying launchpad|63519" data-volume-uuid="d897fadf8" data-volume-id="63519" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-936" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BN2QDs"&gt;While more common missions to space involve rockets launching vertically from the ground, Virgin Orbit’s method of air-launching a rocket off a modified Boeing 747 aims to provide its satellite customers a quicker and more precise way to get to things into orbit. That technique is particularly attractive for companies building cheap small satellites, an increasingly popular sector of the satellite market as launch costs come down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fxrQ6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 10:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds update on LauncherOne’s deployment from its carrier plane, and background on small satellite market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of cinema is a punk-ass Twitch collective</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5HZ5ZGyqsM-MrHXXqSGzQmuAzo=/140x0:1660x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523801/racer_trash_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This radical editing collective is unlearning what they know about film&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iKPjsh"&gt;Like so many beautiful internet creations, &lt;a href="https://racertrash.com/"&gt;Racer Trash&lt;/a&gt; started off as a joke. Last May, editor &lt;a href="http://alextjacobs.com/"&gt;Alex T. Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; caught a double feature of &lt;em&gt;Two-Lane Blacktop&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Speed Racer&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Farielgardner&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ariel Gardner’s&lt;/a&gt; Twitch stream. He typed in chat that he’d always wanted a vaporwave cut of &lt;em&gt;Speed Racer&lt;/em&gt;, but that it would probably never happen. Forty-eight hours later, on Jacobs’ birthday, his wish came true in the form of &lt;em&gt;Speed Vapor&lt;/em&gt;, the first Racer Trash movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFB263"&gt;He and Gardner were in a group chat for filmmakers, mostly friends from industry circles in LA, who had gathered around the communal streaming hearth to watch movies in the pandemic. Jacobs’ dream idea quickly struck a chord with the group. Someone suggested dividing up the film and assigning segments (or “segs,” in racer-speak) to different people; several friends had worked on the 2014 movie &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/02/robocop-crowdsourced-remake/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Robocop Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where dozens of filmmakers reproduced parts of the original &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt; and assembled them into a single, maniacal feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwwjtG"&gt;And so a new film collective was born, fueled by a distinctly punk ethos: to attack and dethrone cinema. One way to describe it might be movie graffiti. But depending who you ask, Racer Trash is also a powerful “fuck you” to capitalism and a nourishing refuge from regular editing work. There’s only one way to watch Racer Trash movies: &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/racerxtrash"&gt;live on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dI9JD6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Warning: the majority of linked videos may affect photosensitive viewers.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqVrhb"&gt;Today, there are over 50 members, around half of whom are “core,” although this is always changing: some work on every movie, others contribute to one and move on. “We were so excited about it,” Gardner says of &lt;em&gt;Speed Vapor&lt;/em&gt;’s two-day turnaround. “The next day, we already had another movie planned out, we already had a Discord going, we were already talking about all the things that it could be and establishing a name of who we were and what our collective was.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNsg5O"&gt;In one year, the collective has reworked and screened &lt;em&gt;Spice World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hausu&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hackers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;, just to name a few. Racer Trash has also mutated away from its vaporwave inspirations into its own distinct entity. Its chaotic movies are interwoven with forgotten TV commercials, joke tweets, watermarked assets, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, 3D computer graphics, and cartoons. &lt;em&gt;Boards of Kaneda&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Altered States&lt;/em&gt;-style &lt;em&gt;Akira&lt;/em&gt; remix set to the music of electronic duo Boards of Canada. There’s the 30-minute long &lt;em&gt;Abbadook&lt;/em&gt;, which is the unholy combination of &lt;em&gt;The Babadook&lt;/em&gt; and Abba. In between feature film streams are short intermission-style snippets, like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F563913317&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this gorgeous reinterpretation&lt;/a&gt; of Fiona Apple’s “Hot Knife.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InksZV"&gt;Several Racer Trash members believe their movies are the densest form of media on the planet, given that film itself is made up of theater and music and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="7YygOI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2pnJFHb7QI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXE9su"&gt;Racer Trash editors refer to themselves as racers or wavers, all professionals from the myriad realms of filmdom. Director &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/adam-wingerd-in-talks-monsterverse-pic-legendary-godzilla-vs-kong-1234745254/"&gt;Adam Wingard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt;), filmmaker &lt;a href="https://heydarbyrose.com/"&gt;D’arby Rose&lt;/a&gt;, artist and designer &lt;a href="https://www.starlinehodge.com/"&gt;Starline Hodge&lt;/a&gt;, and director / comedian &lt;a href="http://www.notjesslane.com/"&gt;Jess Lane&lt;/a&gt; are just a few names among its growing ranks of animators, editors, digital artists, sound engineers, and producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC0IQS"&gt;In the early days, the dozen-or-so members decided on films with a democratic voting system. Now there are multiple projects being worked on at any given time, each helmed by a captain who assigns segs with a random system called “the hat.” As more racers continue to get drawn in through friends or word of mouth, it’s become easier for captains to have a roster that’s ready to go. The process is similar to the exquisite corpse concept, where each racer works on their seg individually, everything is assembled, and everyone watches the finished feature (besides the stream, racers hold internal screenings for themselves). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYDxvg"&gt;One of their most recent films, &lt;em&gt;Suprogman&lt;/em&gt; (with a cameo by the cult Nintendo 64 flop &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh9oR0YTxHs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), was a little different. Captained by founding racer Gardner, the movie was passed around and each racer had a few days to play with it, like a COVID-era longform jam session. As a result, there’s a noticeable sense of cohesion that isn’t present in previous Racer Trash work — a textural difference in the way the film flows, mirroring cosmic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt; vibes and marking the evolution of the collective as a group editing entity (and a great Styx sequence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="trOSnr"&gt;One of the most striking aspects of Racer Trash is how it allows filmmakers to push their craft beyond the constraints of realism, which dictates the majority of commercial editing work. For D’arby Rose, the essence of Racer Trash is being an “unfiltered artist and weirdo,” and she sees it as a healing outlet during the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fuser89615258&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chloe Brett&lt;/a&gt;, a trailer editor for The Royal Cinema in Ontario, randomly connected with Racer Trash folks at an online Adam Sandler marathon. Brett, a self-taught filmmaker, was anxious about her lack of visual effects skills, but soon learned that everyone was happy to share. Racer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fmarisademarini&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marisa DeMarini&lt;/a&gt;’s use of time displacement in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F455309608&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;her &lt;em&gt;r+j&lt;/em&gt; seg&lt;/a&gt; — isolating parts of the image to reflect different representations of time — was a new technique for many others. DeMarini ended up writing a tutorial email for the collective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQhmHV"&gt;“We teach each other things,” explains founding racer &lt;a href="https://www.elliepritts.com/"&gt;Ellie Pritts&lt;/a&gt;, who helped to color-grade early segs that, in turn, shaped a core part of the Racer Trash aesthetic. “It’s a rare thing to find, especially in the professional creative world where I feel like people are really guarded about their techniques and what it is that sets them apart … I think all of us have become really, really good editors over the last year because of that. So it feels like school, a little bit.” DeMarini agrees, comparing the collective’s mutual support system to the proverb “iron sharpens iron.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAvqBz"&gt;Racer Trash also has its own language, which ranges from technical slang to inscrutable acronyms — Jacobs attributes this to everyone in the collective being Extremely Online and attuned to the birth of new phrases. “I can’t pinpoint when we started using ‘wave’ as a replacement verb for ‘edit’ but we definitely do that,” says Pritts. &lt;a href="https://www.tedmarsden.com/"&gt;Ted Marsden&lt;/a&gt;, who did the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F513541130%2Ff865838319&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opener&lt;/a&gt; for the Racer Trash version of &lt;em&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, inadvertently created the meme “LMBIH,” (“Li Mu Bai is here,” referring to Chow Yun-Fat’s character). “The night it premiered the chat blew up repeating the line and it became an instant meme,” Marsden says. “It wasn’t my intention to create a catchphrase or anything like that, it was just a funny idea to me to take this throwaway line and make it as epic as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woJzuz"&gt;Twitch chat is undoubtedly a huge part of the Racer Trash experience — it’s a shockingly positive space full of sincere and wholehearted enthusiasm for each wave. This also means that viewers sometimes pop up to request links to full films, which is a no-no for a few reasons. Ariel Gardner sees the livestream-only format as a substitute for “appointment viewing” when people gathered every week to watch a cherished program. His co-founder Jacobs revels in replicating the experience of catching something weird on late-night TV, which he tried to do with 3AM screenings of Racer Trash’s take on &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s appointment viewing, and then there’s ‘I had this bizarre experience,’ and when you find somebody else who had this bizarre experience, it creates bonds,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFb9fy"&gt;There’s also the matter of copyright law. “When people [ask] us for links, the kind of canned response we give is, ‘Racer Trash is a live experience,’” says Pritts, who adds that she felt buoyed by an off-the-record conversation with a Hollywood studio lawyer about the transformative nature of Racer Trash movies. Since there are no profits involved — the Twitch stream is free — it’s tough to find a legal angle. “In &lt;em&gt;the Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, there’s an episode where they explain that Mr. Burns is so sick, he has so many diseases that they all cross each other out and he becomes healthy, like they all &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0euMFAWF8"&gt;can’t fit through the door&lt;/a&gt; at one time,” Gardner explains on Zoom over Pritts’ muffled laughter. “So that’s where we’re at legally.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5U2XQ"&gt;Most of the racers I spoke to were visibly pumped about the punk elements of their Racer Trash work. &lt;a href="https://harrisonatkins.com/"&gt;Harrison Atkins&lt;/a&gt; gave me an impassioned monologue on how movies are designed to turn profits, how Racer Trash “slices through the forces of dark capital,” and recalls the invitation to do his first seg: “do you want to fuck up &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt;?” There’s a bold sense of triumph among racers over the simple realization that this sort of cinematic subversion was always possible. “You can’t stop us from making these movies,” says &lt;a href="https://caseymakesmovies.com/"&gt;Casey Donahue&lt;/a&gt; when I ask about the fear of getting booted off Twitch. “And that I think resonated with all of us where it’s like if they stop us at any point, it doesn’t mean that we didn’t make this and that we can just keep making this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfN3FT"&gt;I get the sense that Racer Trash has become an artistic gift for many racers who needed something to pour themselves into, like a dam breaking or a multidimensional lightbulb going on. “It’s thrilling, both as an editor and as a consumer of media, to live in a time where a collective like Racer Trash exists,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lolaisabel.com/"&gt;Lola Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, one of the newest racers who worked on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F556321445&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555946%2Fracer-trash-punk-twitch-film-collective" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spice Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was captained by D’arby Rose. “The fact that it was born out of the human need to create during extremely difficult times, in a year that we are globally still grieving and processing, Racer Trash became the epitome of pure, ephemeral self-expression.” Gonzalez is currently working on a few different Racer Trash projects, including a horror feature and a cartoon-centric wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkBvBO"&gt;I’ve never seen anyone deconstruct and remix movies quite like Racer Trash, or grow into such an unanticipated force of creativity. It’s an absolute subversion of our cultural reverence for larger-than-life blockbusters simply by virtue of their prestige and value — they’re often wildly expensive, exclusionary pieces of media starring untouchable celebrities that exist in a realm beyond the average audience. As the traditional moviegoing experience is becoming an endangered species, this is a group of filmmakers who have broken an unspoken taboo to reinvigorate their craft, and amassed a loyal following of viewers in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JDaVG9"&gt;Racer Trash is ultimately a radical act of creative freedom in a time when the pandemic has brought forth new perspectives and priorities. Alex Jacobs, for one, survived a personal apocalypse last year, which has imbued him with what is best described as inspirational yolo energy. “Copyright law, who gives a shit? Money’s out the window. I traded grapes for toilet paper last year,” he says. “It felt like an exciting new thing that we were able to do. And of course we were [always] able to remix movies if we wanted to ... I never thought that I was allowed to do things like that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gs7lTl"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Racer Trash has monthly live screenings on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/racerxtrash"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; — check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/racertrash"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; for the schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack launches Huddles, Discord-like audio calls you can hop in and out of</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gUhwfZkUgN271E-BtMFjiTVNmkQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523699/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Slack gets new features born out of the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="379y7b"&gt;Slack is launching its new Huddles feature today, lightweight audio calls that you and your colleagues can jump in and out of while working. Born out of the pandemic, Slack Huddles are designed to replace those informal conversations you used to have with colleagues across desks. If you’ve ever used Discord, Slack Huddles is very similar, offering the ability to join or leave a persistent call freely at all hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ew9YcG"&gt;Slack is focusing on audio with Huddles rather than video, but there will be a screen-sharing feature to make it easy for teams of people to hold spontaneous meetings that may have happened huddled around a monitor in the pre-pandemic days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYOQRj"&gt;“It allows for two- or three-minute conversations,” explains Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you have to schedule a call… you talk for the full 30 minutes instead of the two or three minutes you needed right in that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7w-ujaMKIIFaRao3pxpXXYYyg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690719/SlackHuddles.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack Huddles are audio-only for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqcFKi"&gt;That time-saving and spontaneity is a key part of Slack Huddles. These audio calls can be created in any channel or DM, including shared communications across companies. The audio experience is designed to mimic people walking by your desk, so there’s no need to send people invites, links, or dial-in numbers — anyone in a channel or a DM group can join freely. Powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280829/slack-amazon-aws-partnership-amazon-chime-voice-video-calls"&gt;Slack’s partnership with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Huddles also includes impressively fast and accurate live captioning through AWS — something I was able to test during my conversation with Butterfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lyvFT"&gt;Slack Huddles is clearly a response to the growing number of video calls that workers are participating in. While Butterfield concedes “we probably will allow video sharing at some point,” the focus of Huddles is to allow people to not have to worry about how they look on a video call, where they’re located, or even what they’re doing during a call. “On an audio call, you can be doing many other things and maintain the illusion that your counterpart is paying complete attention to everything you’re saying,” says Butterfield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWvIIW"&gt;Huddles is also part of a broader effort at Slack to address some of the pain points of collaboration just as people start to filter back to offices, while others continue working from home or some other remote location. The hybrid workplace, as many are calling it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nT67AgC_D_VcHBF7pqNj7H4cue0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690720/WvI714W.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack Huddles feels very similar to Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgrxu6"&gt;“We’ve been living in a world where if all you have is a hammer, everything appears as a nail,” says Butterfield. “It doesn’t mean the classic meetings go away, but I think we’ll stop using that hammer on a bunch of things that aren’t really nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmCB5C"&gt;Slack is also introducing voice, video, and screen recordings in the coming months. Instead of a morning standup, the idea is that people could record their ideas on their own time and send them in a channel. That could be ideal for large teams that work across multiple time zones or just where a daily meeting really isn’t necessary. These recordings that people share will also include a transcript that is searchable in Slack and tools to speed up or slow down playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tE5JCN"&gt;Alongside an influx of video calls during the pandemic, it’s also been easy to get overwhelmed by the number of notifications and messages you have to respond to. “We need to do a better job at teaching people how to use Slack effectively,” admits Butterfield. “Billions of people know what it’s like to tag people on Facebook… mentioning someone in Slack works in the same way, but it has a much greater importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAxlPT"&gt;Butterfield sees Huddles and these new video and screen recordings as alternate modes of communication that could help reduce the anxiety of feeling like you have to instantly respond to a Slack message. It’s not an easy challenge to solve, though, as bringing in new features can also create a whole new set of challenges for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oZGT3Fq3uWNxU77KFXndYLq4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690718/videorecordings.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new video recordings feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNT8N3"&gt;These new features in Slack do hint at where digital tools are heading and a bigger effort to re-create the workplace in an era where many will be working remotely. “What people need in a digital-first world, is something that acts as a virtual HQ and plays the same role for how productivity and collaboration happen just like the building did,” explains Butterfield. “People don’t design their virtual HQ in the same way they do their physical buildings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4rn0s"&gt;Butterfield thinks that might be about to change, as businesses spend more time prioritizing digital tools as effort spent finding the perfect office location, interior design, and favorable lease terms. “Nobody would choose having an office location over having software today,” claims Butterfield. “If you had to choose one or the other, 100 percent of people would choose software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwBuE2"&gt;And he’s probably right. We’ve certainly long crossed the line where in-person communication is now a supplement to the digital ways we connect every day. Slack’s idea of a virtual HQ sounds a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265954/microsoft-viva-platform-features-remote-work"&gt;Microsoft’s approach to the future of work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is also trying to a build a virtual hub with Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYtm3q"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to build a digital hub where work takes place in its own Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams. Shortly after the pandemic began last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office"&gt;Slack filed a competition complaint with the EU&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that Microsoft is “abusing its market dominance” and has “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTglA"&gt;Microsoft just announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Teams will now be bundled into Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, with some tight integration for consumers. Butterfield had only just seen the announcement, so he didn’t have an immediate response. But the company’s communications chief, Jonathan Prince, sent us this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="n59lBV"&gt;Microsoft announced that it is going to bundle Teams with Windows as well as Office. Our reaction is simple: choice is better than lock-in, open is better than closed, and fair competition is best of all. Unfortunately, Microsoft has never seen it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="M1TdP7"&gt;It’s clear that Slack isn’t impressed. But at the same time, Butterfield doesn’t seem to think Teams bundling on Windows will affect Slack too much. I pushed Butterfield on Microsoft chairman and CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549825/microsoft-satya-nadella-apple-google-app-store-rules-conflated-decoder"&gt;Satya Nadella’s comments that Slack can be first-class&lt;/a&gt; on Windows. “Unlike how IE is preinstalled and you have to go download Netscape, using a communications platform is not something each individual user makes a decision about unilaterally,” says Butterfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvJrXI"&gt;“There’s no one that would switch off Slack to Teams just because laptops have it preinstalled, or if we went to Dell and said, ‘Hey, we’ll pay you a bunch of money if you put Slack on it and take Teams out.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDWN0z"&gt;Outside of just Microsoft bundling Teams into Windows, Slack also faces competition from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;Google integrating Chat, Rooms, and Meet into Gmail&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to take on Microsoft and Slack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack&lt;/a&gt; more than six months ago, but the deal hasn’t closed yet so we don’t know exactly how a combination of Salesforce and Slack will compete against Microsoft, Google, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alDWmN"&gt;“I think Salesforce obviously has an enormous number of salespeople, and that will be helpful for the business,” admits Butterfield. “I think the thing that will be more helpful is the depth of integration with Salesforce’s existing suite of products, and the impact that has on mutual customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HQkYA3"&gt;Slack’s focus has always been about making its product loved by the millions who rely on it daily, rather than Microsoft and Google’s approach to bundling services together. Huddles is a great example of Slack’s approach, but the company will need many more Huddle-like features and some deep integration with Salesforce to fend off Microsoft and Google’s attempts to win the digital workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
