    <title>Apple digital keys reportedly coming to some Hyundai cars this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Launch Of Hyundai Motor Company’s All-New Genesis In Seoul" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfdEivnIMZV3kc1Edqsn1Bhzhyg=/95x0:2906x1874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399186/452075859.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyundai’s Genesis cars could soon get access to the feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTe4XF"&gt;Hyundai and its Genesis brand are reportedly close to adding support for Apple’s digital car key feature, which lets you unlock and start compatible vehicles using the iPhone’s Wallet app, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/what-will-apple-aapl-call-its-new-ar-vr-headset-apple-vision-apple-reality-kyhmibia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;. According to Gurman, the so-called “CarKey” feature is set to come to Hyundai’s Genesis lineup this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOF2SK"&gt;Hyundai already offers proprietary iOS apps, including &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myhyundai-with-bluelink/id893514610"&gt;MyHyundai with Bluelink&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genesis-intelligent-assistant/id867941329"&gt;Genesis Intelligent Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which include the ability to remotely start, or unlock the doors of compatible vehicles. But adding support for Apple’s implementation of the digital key feature should make the functionality more seamless, and benefit from system-level Apple Wallet shortcuts. &lt;a href="https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/resources/technology-and-navigation/frequently-asked-questions-about-hyundai-digital-key.html"&gt;Hyundai’s site&lt;/a&gt; notes that its NFC-based digital key feature is currently only available on Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JdaKwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;References to Hyundai have previously been discovered in iOS code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnE6MA"&gt;Apple first announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;digital car key feature in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but so far it’s only available on select BMW models. Reports that it would be coming to Hyundai’s cars date back to at least January 2021 when &lt;a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=58446"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Korea&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the plans, and reference’s to Hyundai’s Genesis cars &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/genesis-digital-car-keys-code/"&gt;have also been discovered in iOS 15 code&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbuKMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t specify whether Hyundai plans to make use of recent iPhones’ ultra wideband (UWB) technology, which could allow owners to unlock their car without having to take their phone out of their pocket, or whether it will just use NFC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW previously announced&lt;/a&gt; the feature for its all-electric iX, relying on the U1 chip found in the iPhone 11 and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGDqG"&gt;Apple and Hyundai were previously rumored to be in discussions to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;produce an electric car together&lt;/a&gt;. Hyundai later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;downplayed these rumors&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was no longer in talks with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s next flagship leaks with OnePlus-esque Hasselblad branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_ICSM7Op5l5KT4vHKed6DGZn9o=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399142/1eaf989963bd7d4e0ee82817325daf47.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uI1jRl"&gt;Details on Oppo’s upcoming flagship phone are starting to come together. Multiple leaks are suggesting it’ll be called the Find X5 Pro, with a similar design to last year’s Find X3 Pro and specs broadly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22865569/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs"&gt;the new OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is already available in China. (OnePlus, of course, is now treated as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;sub-brand of Oppo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjJTG2"&gt;The Find X3 Pro wasn’t sold in the US, but it did make its way to Europe and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;one of the best phones of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Renders recently &lt;a href="https://prepp.in/news/e-509-oppo-find-x5-2022-launch-exclusive-5k-renders-expected-dates-specifications-and-more"&gt;released by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; show a device with a camera bump that flows into the rest of the back panel in a similar fashion to the Find X3 Pro, although the camera configuration has changed and doesn’t appear to include the previous phone’s unique ring light-equipped “microscope” camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="33Hpar"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPO&lt;/a&gt; Find X5 Pro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Snapdragon 8 Gen1&lt;br&gt;- 2K 120HZ refresh rate LTPO 2.0 display&lt;br&gt;- 50MP IMX766 OIS + 50MP IMX766 + 13MP S5K3M5&lt;br&gt;- 5000mAh battery&lt;br&gt;80 watt wired charging&lt;br&gt;50 watt wireless charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actual Source:&lt;a href="https://t.co/IGsScfYEsN"&gt;https://t.co/IGsScfYEsN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TTCaVuVbWZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TTCaVuVbWZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Abhishek Yadav (@yabhishekhd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1482910986768031744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyCJBJ"&gt;Alleged real-world photos that corroborate the &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; renders have also now appeared online, showing a white model of the phone with Hasselblad branding, just like OnePlus’ latest flagships. There’s also a shot of the device’s settings menu that says it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, like the OnePlus 10 Pro, as well as Oppo’s own new chip, the MariSilicon X. This is an NPU used for image processing; it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833796/oppo-air-glass-ar-glasses-announced-china-release-date"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late last year alongside Oppo’s Air Glass AR device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJnymw"&gt;There are other specs that have been floating around Chinese social media channels that can’t be verified but don’t sound very surprising, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;as with the OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Oppo’s previous two Find X flagships were announced in March, so we should get official details fairly soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is getting serious about the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6H65h2a75hlvo0cLGBbiKy2EOLI=/0x0:4603x3069/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70397592/1183648613.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilWdNY"&gt;Walmart appears to be getting ready for a leap into the metaverse. Recent trademark applications indicate the company is looking to establish its own NFTs and cryptocurrency, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOyr3"&gt;The retail giant filed for several trademarks on December 30th, suggesting plans to start selling virtual goods, including electronics, toys, appliances, sporting equipment, apparel, home decor, and more, as noted by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;. There’s mention of offering customers a digital currency, as well as the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs. Meanwhile, another application details possible “physical fitness training services” and “classes in the field of health and nutrition” that could take place in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality environments (VR) — the company made a separate filing for the use of its name and logo in VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sd1bGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart also filed trademarks for “Verse to Home,” “Verse to Curb,” and “Verse to Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaaFs4"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-16/walmart-plans-to-create-cryptocurrency-and-nfts-cnbc-reports"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart also filed trademarks for the names “Verse to Home,” “Verse to Curb,” and “Verse to Store,” a hint that Walmart may be preparing a virtual shopping experience (that hopefully doesn’t look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/5/22868323/walmart-metaverse-shopping-video-viral-old"&gt;the one created for the company in 2017&lt;/a&gt;). The filings are publicly available on the US Patent and Trademark Office’s site, some of which are listed under the name “Walmart Connect,” the retailer’s digital advertising endeavor. You can access the filings by searching for “Walmart” or “Walmart Connect” on the &lt;a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search"&gt;Trademark Electronic Search System&lt;/a&gt; (TESS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI9uGl"&gt;“Walmart is continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences,” Walmart spokesperson Carrie McKnight told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We don’t have anything further to share today, but it’s worth noting we routinely file trademark applications as part of the innovation process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPpCbc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627111/walmart-cryptocurrency-payments-hire-amazon"&gt;Walmart posted a job listing for a cryptocurrency product specialist&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs of Walmart’s growing interest in the metaverse. Other retailers are taking part in the metaverse movement as well, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike looking to cash in on NFTs and virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843104/adidas-nfts-metaverse-sold-bored-ape"&gt;Adidas selling out of its &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt; NFT collection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2022-1/01/gap-launches-gamified-collectible-nft-experience-t"&gt;Gap offering NFTs of its hoodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Safari 15 bug can leak your recent browsing activity and personal identifiers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-QZjSU3L78a6LZ3zw-_6BJ96aI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70397170/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYwPrx"&gt;A bug in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;Safari 15&lt;/a&gt; can leak your browsing activity, and can also reveal some of the personal information attached to your Google account, according to &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/"&gt;findings from FingerprintJS&lt;/a&gt;, a browser fingerprinting and fraud detection service (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability stems from an issue with Apple’s implementation of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt;, an application programming interface (API) that stores data on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQC8Ia"&gt;As explained by FingerprintJS, IndexedDB abides by the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"&gt;same-origin policy&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts one origin from interacting with data that was collected on other origins — essentially, only the website that generates data can access it. For example, if you open your email account in one tab and then open a malicious webpage in another, the same-origin policy prevents the malicious page from viewing and meddling with your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ixhif6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s not much you can do to get around the issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IhMBJI"&gt;FingerprintJS found that Apple’s application of the IndexedDB API in Safari 15 actually violates the same-origin policy. When a website interacts with a database in Safari, FingerprintJS says that “a new (empty) database with the same name is created in all other active frames, tabs, and windows within the same browser session.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHR6w5"&gt;This means other websites can see the name of other databases created on other sites, which could contain details specific to your identity. FingerprintJS notes sites that use your Google account, like YouTube, Google Calendar, and Google Keep, all generate databases with your unique Google User ID in its name. Your Google User ID allows Google to access your publicly-available information, such as your profile picture, which the Safari bug can expose to other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1FgUpg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a huge bug. On OSX, Safari users can (temporarily) switch to another browser to avoid their data leaking across origins. iOS users have no such choice, because Apple imposes a ban on other browser engines. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT"&gt;https://t.co/aXdhDVIjTT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1482627132903858176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bYMxQ"&gt;FingerprintJS created &lt;a href="https://safarileaks.com/"&gt;a proof-of-concept demo&lt;/a&gt; you can try out if you have Safari 15 and above on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. The demo uses the browser’s IndexedDB vulnerability to identify the sites you have open (or opened recently), and shows how sites that exploit the bug can scrape information from your Google User ID. It currently only detects 30 popular sites that are affected by the bug, such as include Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, Xbox, but it likely affects far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St7eCX"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to get around the issue, as FingerprintJS says the bug also affects Private Browsing mode on Safari. You can use a different browser on macOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;Apple’s third-party browser engine ban on iOS&lt;/a&gt; means all browsers are affected. FingerprintJS reported the leak to the WebKit Bug Tracker on November 28th, but there hasn’t been an update to Safari yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJwOIsI9IXEFPr5hF0yw-01sgv0=/53x0:2048x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396772/samsung_galaxy_s8_ultra_tab.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra may have a 14.6-inch display with a notch. | Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAqDQj"&gt;Samsung might be adding its first-ever “Ultra” model to its upcoming Galaxy Tab S8 lineup, which will also include a Tab S8 and S8 Plus, as rumored by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bH7WWr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the flagship Ultra model could sport a 14.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a 2960 x 1848px resolution, a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, as well as a notch with two 12-megapixel (MP) cameras. It may also come with the option of up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, along with a 11200mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30F2KvIVz7ydyYWgg42-oKNdhPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23172714/galaxy_tab_s8_plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Galaxy Tab S8 Plus is rumored to have a 12.7-inch display with no notch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmooi"&gt;When compared to the Tab S8 Ultra, the Super AMOLED display on the Tab S8 Plus is a bit smaller, potentially measuring at 12.7 inches with a resolution of 2800 x 1752px. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says the midgrade model may not have a notch and could come with a 10090mAh battery. The base Tab S8 model will obviously be the smallest of the bunch and is rumored to have an 11-inch LTPS TFT display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600px, a notch-less design, and an 8000mAh battery. Both the Tab S8 and S8 Plus have smaller memory and storage options, offering up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzpVj"&gt;As for what’s powering the devices, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; notes that each tablet in Samsung’s new lineup may come with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip&lt;/a&gt; and the Adreno 730 GPU. All models will also have a 13MP dual camera and 6MP ultra wide-angle lens on the back, a 12MP camera in the front (except for the Ultra, which has two), S-Pen compatibility, under-display fingerprint scanners, optional 5G connectivity, as well as quad speakers that support Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJPzVP"&gt;There’s no confirmed pricing information for any S8 Tabs just yet, but a leak from &lt;a href="https://appuals.com/samsung-tab-s8-prices-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might provide a hint at what to expect. &lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt; claims pricing for the Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Ultra begins at 1,040€ to 1,060€ (~$1,187 to $1,210), with additional storage and 5G connectivity adding to that price. The Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Plus could start at 880€ to 900€ (~$1,004 to $1,027), with the base Tab S8 potentially starting at 680€ to 700€ (~$776 to $799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GiRAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; predicts that Samsung will either introduce its Galaxy Tab S8 lineup at its February 8th Samsung Unpacked event (potentially alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S22&lt;/a&gt;), or at the Mobile World Conference (MWC), which begins on February 28th. Samsung last released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 lineup&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, which only consists of two tablets: the Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wordle! and Wardle team up to donate proceeds from an unrelated app’s popularity spike</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArkgCl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a free browser game, and a browser game only — it has no accompanying apps, something that some people (myself included, regrettably) might not realize during a time when nearly everything has an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tyw6yh"&gt;This leaves plenty of room for &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-pulls-wordle-knockoffs-app-store-2022-01-12/"&gt;fake &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; apps to crowd app stores&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to leech off of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story"&gt;the word puzzle game’s sudden rise in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one app coincidentally called &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; that’s not a clone — it actually existed before the browser game itself. That’s why its developer is teaming up with the mind behind the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;, Josh Wardle, to use its accidental success as an opportunity to give back, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-with-unrelated-five-year-old-wordle-app-is-donating-proceeds-to-charity/1100-6499675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L33cC"&gt;The story unraveled in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta/status/1482056565867696128"&gt;a thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Steven Cravotta, detailing how his coding project blew up five years after its creation, unknowingly riding on &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;’s coattails. He developed an iOS app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordle/id1095569891"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 to brush up on his coding skills, and while it got around 100,000 downloads, it wasn’t as successful as a previous game he built, called &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt;, so Cravotta decided to stop updating and promoting the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4L6YM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Can confirm this is true. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StevenCravotta&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me unprompted and asked about donating the proceeds. He's a class act and you should follow him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh"&gt;https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1482007797437014020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5B5V4"&gt;Cravotta says that downloads for &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; slowed to around one to two per day, but when the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; started taking off, so did his app. The app racked up 200,000 downloads in a single week, albeit from confused users who mistook it for the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;. Cravotta reached out to &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Josh Wardle, and let him know about his plans to donate the proceeds from his app to charity — Wardle sent out a tweet of his own to acknowledge the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThoNvQ"&gt;Cravotta later confirmed that he and Wardle decided to donate any money earned by &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; to BoostOakland, a charity geared towards tutoring and mentoring young people in Oakland, California. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Cravotta, he told us that he has collected a little more than $2,000 so far and that he’ll donate the total amount earned at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The trials and tribulations of turning a real camera into a webcam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mcxjiyJ2CXUMaJv8uduZIjqVa_c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396326/VRG_ILL_4947_Sony_Webcam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not a Sony A7 III, but it will do.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Samar Haddad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A mirrorless camera should just work; it did not&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4wV0En"&gt;My colleague Dieter Bohn is one of the nicest people I’ve met, but every time I’d hop onto Zoom to record &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there would be just the tiniest, most minute twitch of displeasure on his face. Dieter was too kind to address the big, camera-obscuring elephant in the room: how for several minutes, instead of my face, he’d see a giant reversed Sony Imaging Edge webcam logo — a huge white W on an orange square set against a not-quite-black background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXvElb"&gt;Finally, after at least four months of the big W, he politely asked, “Alex, what’s your address?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doJ5r6"&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lqc6Ga"&gt;“So I can send you an HDMI adapter.” He said it with that unique Midwestern clip that says, “I am being very polite and gracious, but you should know I may also commit a murder in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cS3rNE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’d already collected more “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vbVJ"&gt;Dieter, and indeed all my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, had been forced to stare at that ugly W because I wanted to convert my very expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17176246/sony-a7-a7r-iii-alpha-3-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price"&gt;Sony A7 III&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera into a webcam. I was feeling frugal, and I’d already collected more capture cards and “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists; I was sure I could figure out a way to give my Zoom experience a gorgeous boost with minimal cost. Who doesn’t want to control the ISO and aperture and have all their colleagues ask why you’re in high definition when they’re firmly in standard? While some of my colleagues might rather tinker with phone settings or CPU voltages, I could happily spend weeks — months — perfecting my Zoom look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="95xpJ1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I refuse to care about the quality of my webcam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GCrjv0"&gt;It’s supposed to be easy. You buy a mount for your camera. (Deputy editor Dan Seifert recommended this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1015864-REG%2Fimpact_3_section_double_articulated.html%3Fcnxclid%3D16418337913438427578510070301008005&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 arm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F824360-REG%2Fimpact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 clamp&lt;/a&gt;, which worked great.) You download some software to your computer. You plug your big expensive digital camera into your computer and you have &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0WsOO"&gt;Sony’s A7 III had other plans for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PQPV5"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, webcam shortages led to many people requesting software that would let them use their expensive cameras as webcams. Camera makers happily obliged. Sony was one of the last, but that additional time feels ... poorly spent. The Mac version, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517673/sony-imaging-edge-webcam-digital-camera-webcam-software-mac"&gt;which launched in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is more driver than app. Sony’s software does little more than tell my computer that my camera is a camera, and throws up the W whenever the video feed isn’t ready. There’s no controlling of settings or any of the other things that, say, Sony’s tethering app can do (like ISO and aperture). There’s simply installation and prayers. You install it, restart your computer, and pray Sony Imaging appears in the camera choices for apps you use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="uZqJ0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s simply installation and prayers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEWqne"&gt;Importantly, you then have to open an app that uses your camera, and then turn on the camera, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; wait for Sony Imaging Edge Webcam to start running before your video will actually, finally appear on the screen. If you turn on the camera &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you open, say, Zoom, you may be faced with an error message saying the camera is already in use. Only restarting the physical Sony camera itself will resolve it — and while you’re busy fixing things, other people on the Zoom call (probably Dieter) are stuck looking at that big ugly W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvzzw"&gt;Mastering the order of operations is key. So is remembering to reboot it periodically during the day. When I walked away after a call and came back to do another one, I found myself staring at the W because the camera decided to power itself off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9CAsq"&gt;Eventually, I did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhcranz/status/1462803898675175425?s=20"&gt;buy that adapter Dieter had been begging me to buy for months&lt;/a&gt;, and it instantly resolved my great orange W issue. But it revealed that while I’d laid a lot of blame at Sony Imaging Edge Webcam’s feet, the software didn’t deserve all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFG43ReMCsGvS8jQzSYhHu4tAlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160196/gygvusba7iii__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a viable webcam power source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpR8D3"&gt;Those automatic shutdowns? With that big orange W glaring at me I’d naturally assumed they were a software problem. But my coworkers (and I) soon learned it was a &lt;em&gt;heating &lt;/em&gt;problem. The &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fgygvusba7iii.html&amp;amp;subid1=Verge011322"&gt;USB-powered dummy battery ($45.95)&lt;/a&gt; I used was overheating my entire camera, forcing it to shut down again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fue1K8"&gt;I’m now on a quest for an adapter that will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; overheat my entire camera. But so far, I’ve already spent $80 on a stand, $46 on a battery pack, and $25 on an HDMI adapter. That’s $151 I’d sunk into trying to cheaply turn my DSLR into a high-powered webcam. For the same price, I could have picked up a webcam from Newegg or Micro Center and avoided the shame of the W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La4bye"&gt;And after spending all that money trying to have the very best fidelity webcam, that’s when Opal launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;the $300 Opal C1&lt;/a&gt;. My co-workers love it, probably because it does everything I’d spent $151 on, but in a tiny package that doesn’t also require investing in a costly camera. I try to be a savvy enough tech shopper that I rarely regret purchases, but reading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;Cameron Faulkner’s review of the C1&lt;/a&gt; while my expensive and not very reliable webcam literally loomed over my head gave me some powerful regret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HuJ1yD5Y1CPqGlp6jjxIFBWdTYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067802/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Opal C1, quietly mocking me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmLZFg"&gt;Soon after, I edited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"&gt;Allison Johnson’s piece about refusing to care about her webcam&lt;/a&gt; because she has no interest in tinkering with that part of her work setup. I wildly disagree with her (that’s okay! She also likes Android phones!) — a big reason I spent so much time trying to perfect this setup was because it was something I wanted to tinker with. I wanted to be finicky and tweak things and produce the best image I could even if it was only visible to Nilay, Dieter, and Andru during a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; recording on Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHNYnj"&gt;I probably won’t get the Opal C1 or even just a budget webcam at Micro Center. I probably &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;continue to refresh &lt;a href="https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/webcam/en/"&gt;the Sony Imaging Edge Webcam page&lt;/a&gt; hoping for a better update, while buying and returning scores of USB dummy battery adapters as I hunt for one that doesn’t exacerbate the Sony A7 III’s well-known heating problem. I’ll continue to tinker even as Dieter’s eye twitches and I inevitably get roasted on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1FrLu"&gt;Trying to turn a real camera into a webcam will not be worth the money or time I’ve spent thus far and will probably continue to spend. But one day I will have that perfect video quality and a keen satisfaction with all the effort I’ve put into this relatively needless task. No one will acknowledge my webcam and I’ll feel immense pride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pgnRwx"&gt;And then I’ll probably start working on my Zoom background.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google might’ve accidentally approved an ad for a Target gift card scam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Brs29KvSur0yTml2BcI3Zdjax0g=/0x0:4245x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70395232/1288098838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Loccisano / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKqHbu"&gt;Most of us check our gift card balances online (because who actually keeps those receipts that tell us how much money we have left on them?), making an apparent oversight by Google all the worse. It appears that Google inadvertently approved a prominent ad for a phony Target gift card balance checker that’s meant to steal your funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg9E3y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/"&gt;A Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;r/assholedesign&lt;/a&gt; discovered the slip-up when searching Google for “Target gift card balance” on mobile, and found that the very first result is an ad, titled “Check Gift Card Balance - Target.” Only, the site isn’t Target — it’s actually a site called “bristolhirevan.” The ad’s description says it will let you check your gift card balance “immediately,” and that it also offers “all van sizes to fit your needs” — how can you get more legit than that?  My colleague Sean Hollister and I found the same phony ad when searching for the exact phrase ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V1vAjQ"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-15T22:45:40.362882+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;I googled target gift card balance to check gift card balances. An ad appears above the actual target website that copies the target website. I'm imagining it steals card numbers from people that don't check. I reported the ad to Google a few days ago and nothing has happened to it.&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;assholedesign&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNNXPF"&gt;Okay, while the name of the site doesn’t sound convincing at all, its interface sure looks like the real thing, although the actual Target site requires you to sign in to check your gift card balance, while this fake site doesn’t. Besides that, the only things that are off about the webpage are the URL, which still has the “bristolhirevan” domain and the fact that every single link on the page leads to the real Target homepage, despite promising to link to a weekly ad or a gift registry. If you were really in a rush (and were somehow distracted enough to ignore the mention of vans), you just might accidentally enter your gift card’s number and security code here, resulting in it getting stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbNs8c"&gt;Gift card scams appear to be on the rise. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-data-show-major-increase-gift-cards-scam-payment-method"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that victims of gift card scams lost a total of $148 million&lt;/a&gt; within the first nine months of 2021 — more than all of 2020. Target gift cards are apparently scammers’ cards of choice, as FTC data shows people were scammed out of $35 million worth of Target gift cards last year, more than double the amount of any other gift card brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61J1Xr"&gt;As pointed out by the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/gift-card-scams"&gt;gift card scams&lt;/a&gt; often take place over the phone, with the scammer pretending to be an employee of a company like Google or Amazon (or even someone from a federal agency) who demands the victim make a payment in the form of a gift card. However, fake balance checker sites like these often hide in plain sight — apparently even as ads on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUWX4G"&gt;A 2020 report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scammers-spoof-targets-gift-card-balance-checking-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; draws attention to sites that impersonate Target gift card balance checker pages, noting that Target is actually one of the most popular sites for scammers to replicate. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Google with a request for comment about how this scam may have slipped through its ad review process, and if it will be removed, but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile spend billions on more 5G spectrum </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zn3KZ1"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile dropped billions of dollars in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction to acquire more 5G spectrum licenses in the midrange 3.45GHz to 3.55GHz band, according to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-dish-spend-billions-on-spectrum-for-5g-services-11642188054"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA5pFV"&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T was the biggest spender at $9 billion, Dish spent $7.3 billion, and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list, like Three Forty-Five Spectrum, which you can view on &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-dish-win-big-in-andromeda-auction-verizon-gets-nothing/d/d-id/774625"&gt;Light Reading’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YDLbhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the third-largest FCC auction yet, with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxTIvd"&gt;The auction officially ended in November, but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (&lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-379256A1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). Total bids reached about $22.5 billion, making it the third-largest FCC spectrum auction yet. Only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;last year’s $80 billion C-band auction&lt;/a&gt; (over half of which was contributed by Verizon), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7945035/fcc-aws-3-spectrum-auction-largest-ever"&gt;2015’s $44.9 billion AWS-3 auction&lt;/a&gt; top this amount of spending, as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/fccs-345-ghz-5g-auction-now-third-largest-in-aggregate-bids"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB3yi4"&gt;When it comes to using the 3.45GHz band, however, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; says that companies will have to deploy new radios on cell towers that have the ability to broadcast signals across it. Smartphones that support C-band may already be capable of using the band, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; also notes, as they both fall under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) n77 technical standards that cover 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz, which existing 5G smartphones already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="110NtU"&gt;Although the 3.45GHz band operates closely to C-band, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not as likely to interfere with aircraft equipment. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;set to deploy their expanded 5G C-band services on January 19th&lt;/a&gt; after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delayed the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;rollout twice&lt;/a&gt; due to aircraft safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store cube stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbql_Y8lQk52pmKhPsCxgYqN-xw=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394216/theverge3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mILrja"&gt;“Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,” Apple states in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgxOlg"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests&lt;/a&gt; before entering the office, with unvaccinated retail workers testing twice per week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;lowered the frequency of these tests&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that Apple’s “infrequent” testing policy no longer applies to employees who don’t receive the booster shot by Apple’s deadline, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sp61V"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;Meta said employees will need to get a COVID-19 booster shot&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the company’s return to in-office work in March. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;have the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices"&gt;take weekly molecular tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
