    <title>China has landed on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-MARS PROBE-TIANWEN-1-FOURTH ORBITAL CORRECTION-IMAGE (CN)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih73i8RnywtQ3XLKJsBj9fKMTR8=/0x625:3000x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289643/1230995747.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdVKlQ"&gt;China landed its first pair of robots on the surface of Mars on Friday, state-affiliated media &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CGTNOfficial/status/1393365096609435648"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on social media, becoming the second country to do so successfully after overcoming a daring, seven-minute landing sequence. The country’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft ejected the rover-lander bundle for a Martian touchdown at around 7PM ET, kicking off a mission to study the Red Planet’s climate and geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FshZmf"&gt;The mission marks China’s first independent trek to Mars, about 200 million miles away from Earth. Only NASA has successfully managed to land and operate rovers on the planet in the past. (The Soviet Union’s Mars 3 spacecraft landed on the planet in 1971 and communicated for about 20 seconds before unexpectedly going dark.) China’s mission, involving three spacecraft working together, is ambitiously complex for a first-timer — the first US mission, Viking 1 in 1976, only involved a lander deployed from its probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9wAYu"&gt;The landing took place at Utopia Planitia, a flat swath of Martian land and the same region where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. After touching down, the lander will unfurl a ramp and deploy China’s Zhurong rover, a six-wheeled solar-powered robot named after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology. The rover carries a suite of onboard instruments, including two cameras, a Mars-Rover Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Magnetic Field Detector, and Mars Meteorology Monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO5zKt"&gt;The Tianwen-1 spacecraft launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in China’s Hainan province on July 23rd last year, setting off on a seven-month trek to the Red Planet. The spacecraft trio “has functioned normally” since it entered Mars orbit in February, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement Friday morning. It collected a “huge amount” of scientific data and snapped photos of Mars while in its orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c7DC5O"&gt;The Tianwen-1 orbiter, clutching the rover-lander bundle, has been scoping out the Utopia Planitia landing site for over three months, flying close to Mars every 49 hours in an elliptical orbit (an egg-shaped orbital pattern), according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fchina-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436072%2Fchina-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist covering China’s activities in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzDYog"&gt;Now on the Martian surface, the Zhurong rover will embark on a mission of at least three months to study Mars’ climate and geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8YZIL"&gt;“The main task of Tianwen-1 is to perform a global and extensive survey of the entire planet using the orbiter, and to send the rover to surface locations of scientific interests to conduct detailed investigations with high accuracy and resolution,” the mission’s top scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1148-6"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. The roughly 240kg rover is nearly twice the mass of China’s Yutu Moon rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCeNHw"&gt;Tianwen-1 is the name of the overall Mars mission, named after the long poem “Tianwen,” which means “Questions to Heaven.” It marks the latest in a quick succession of advances in space exploration for China. The country became the first nation in history to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;land and operate a rover&lt;/a&gt; on the far side of the Moon in 2019. It also completed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;brief lunar sample mission&lt;/a&gt; in December last year, launching a robot to the Moon and swiftly returning it back to Earth with a cache of Moon rocks for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Long March 5B, the same rocket used to send Tianwen-1 to Mars, launches a space station module last month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8HI59"&gt;More recently, China launched the first core module of its planned space station, Tianhe, which will serve as living quarters for groups of astronauts. The rocket that launched that module spawned an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;international freakout&lt;/a&gt; over where on Earth it might reenter. (It eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22426968/chinese-rocket-re-entered-earth-atmosphere"&gt;reentered&lt;/a&gt; over the Indian Ocean, and large chunks of the rocket splashed down roughly 30 miles off an island in the Maldives, the Chinese government said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bp8QLx"&gt;Despite this ambitious trek to Mars with its trio of three robots, China’s focus seems to be fixed on the Moon — the same immediate destination for NASA’s Artemis program. Earlier this year, China &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to build a lunar space station and base on the Moon’s surface with Russia, NASA’s longtime partner on the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGGleJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that we’re now waiting for official word from China as to whether the mission was a success or failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ1ApS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now with confirmation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter politely asks you to protect its targeted ad dollars in new iOS 14.5 prompt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubKsTG_gcfxb7B5-IGw6T3eiUqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290632/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shKhfk"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; forces developers to ask permission for something they used to be able to do for free: track iOS users. Today, Twitter is joining the ranks of other developers and adding a prompt that asks users to enable tracking on iOS (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/twitter-app-tracking-transparency-support/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ2nR0"&gt;Twitter’s main justification for listening to its request is straightforward — having the feature enabled allows it to serve “better” ads. The company includes a link to settings so you can make those changes, but read Twitter’s explanation before you decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZXbtIX"&gt;Keep ads relevant to you by allowing Twitter to track data from other companies on this device, like apps you use and websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEzkzL"&gt;The company also includes a link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/about-ios-tracking"&gt;a support post&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter help center which explains why it has to ask for permission, includes a link to its current App Privacy Policy, and goes over what enabling or disabling tracking does in iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHLWi8XOwvk6Hm6F5shHPFyKnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515698/Image_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitter ad tracking prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoO3K"&gt;It’s a surprisingly low-key attempt to get users to allow Twitter to track them, considering the company highlighted Apple’s addition of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5 as a potential risk in its recent &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;earnings statement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KRFfUZ"&gt;We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. How much faster will depend on various factors, including our execution on our direct response roadmap and macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fOfnN"&gt;Facebook and Instagram took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;a far more aggressive approach&lt;/a&gt; to convince users its use of ad tracking is on the up-and-up — even going as far as including a vague threat that enabling tracking will “help keep Facebook/Instagram free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syShzs"&gt;Companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on tracking users to support their separate, often very lucrative ad businesses. After all, it’s usually ad sales that pay for free social networks,  and customer data helps to target those ads. As a company that’s more interested in selling hardware and subscription services, Apple doesn’t really have to worry about things like that, but brash changes like the new tracking permissions can leave developers scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Qksg"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has proven popular, though — around &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are opting out of tracking according to some recent surveys. And with Google considering developing its own methods for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;blocking tracking on Android&lt;/a&gt;, we might just have to get used to apps coming to us and begging for free data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay will enact a sex ban starting June 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual World Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_drjilRg7fEs2miuGqSZh8lqkJw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290345/1229865757.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rVASp"&gt;If you’re hoping to turn a dollar on that extremely explicit hentai you picked up in college, you won’t be selling it on eBay. As first &lt;a href="https://avn.com/business/articles/legal/breaking-ebay-to-ban-sale-of-all-adult-items-effective-june-15-900875.html"&gt;noticed by Adult Video News&lt;/a&gt;, eBay is banning the sale of most sexually explicit materials starting June 15th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaiRGB"&gt;Everyone has a different definition of what constitutes “sexually explicit” and eBay’s is extremely PG. While the policy is confusing in that it appears to conflate nudity and sexually explicit content, it carefully defines nudity as “showing any part of male or female genitalia, anus, or female breasts where the areola or nipple is visible.” It goes on to say that those same bits don’t get a pass if they’re covered by see-through material or confined by tight clothing. The policy also classifies “people engaged in sexual contact or activity” as nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egr3Xf"&gt;It goes on to say “most adult-only items are prohibited” and includes “sexually explicit anime, comics, books, films, animation, manga, hentai, yaoi” as among the things considered adult only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRXPBU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fpolicies%2Fprohibited-restricted-items%2Frestricted-adult-items-policy%3Fid%3D4278%26st%3D3%26pos%3D1%26query%3DRestricted%2520adult%2520items%2520policy%26intent%3Drestricted%2520adult%26lucenceai%3Dlucenceai%26docId%3DHELP1181&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436855%2Febay-sex-ban-june-15" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The policy, as written,&lt;/a&gt; would appear to ban the sale of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, where “&lt;a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sexposition"&gt;sexposition&lt;/a&gt;” was all the rage, as well as films like &lt;em&gt;Blue is the Warmest Color&lt;/em&gt;. Your favorite romance novel would be safe (images, not words, appear to be the problem) but Alan Moore’s epic comic collection &lt;em&gt;Lost Girls&lt;/em&gt;, where Wendy from Peter Pan and Dorothy from &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt; just really go at it in more pages than I personally wanted to see, would not. Explicit comics, explicit manga, hentai, and yaoi, which a pedantic might say are all the same thing, would be forbidden under the policy as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwZSsO"&gt;The policy does, however, carve out an exemption for &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Playgirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mayfair&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Penthouse&lt;/em&gt;. Tasteful nudes sold in the Art section would also be allowed provided poses are acceptable and there are no sexual acts. What that means for prints of any version of Leda and the Swan is up to eBay. The same would likely go for the complete works of Katsushika Hokusai. The artist is best known for his woodblock print series featuring Mount Fuji, but was also known for his extremely explicit woodblock print erotica—including one of the earliest instances of “tentacle porn”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83aovF"&gt;Sex toys in unopened packages will continue to be permitted provided the packaging isn’t sexually explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6ASK"&gt;Censorship, even in a relatively open marketplace like eBay, is a notoriously tricky business. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129532/tumblr-nsfw-porn-ban-fallout-storystream-updates-news"&gt;Tumblr attempted to deal with its porn problem&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, it saw traffic take a nosedive as horny users went elsewhere. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvb7z/ebay-is-banning-hentai-and-other-adult-content"&gt;eBay told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this new ban was in the interest of safety. Banning all adult content should make it more difficult for bad actors to monetize revenge porn or other content published without the consent of all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lextnd"&gt;When reached for comment eBay told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1q4j1Z"&gt;eBay is committed to maintaining a safe and trusted marketplace. Starting June 15, 2021, items showing sexual content or sexually suggestive poses will no longer be allowed on eBay.com. The “Everything Else &amp;gt; Adult Only” will no longer be available as a category. No new listings will be allowed in the Adult Only category and good-til-cancelled listings will be ended upon their renewal date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Venmo shows who you’re friends with even if you’re Joe Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Colonial Pipeline Hack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mXHYz836NW-bG8Z_rL5JHTjYwuI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290210/1317830580.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by T.J. Kirkpatrick-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N8xFgN"&gt;Venmo has a major privacy flaw that’s been well-known &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-wrong-with-your-venmo-account-and-how-to-fix-it-1543932128"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjxqa/venmo-letter-eff-mozilla-public-by-default-settings"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;: there’s no way to keep your list of Venmo contacts private. That means you can see the contact list of any user on the platform, a flaw that’s so large that &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; was able to track down President Joe Biden’s Venmo account &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;in less than 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv1htD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; didn’t just find the president, though; the publication also discovered accounts for many people in Biden’s inner circle, and, because of the nature of this flaw, all of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; contacts as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BCmibJ"&gt;BuzzFeed News found nearly a dozen Biden family members and mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the first family, but a wide network of people around them, including the president’s children, grandchildren, senior White House officials, and all of their contacts on Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SQahvk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; dug in after seeing a mention of Biden sending his grandchildren money over Venmo &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/joe-biden-policy-decisions.html"&gt;in a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article published Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s transactions weren’t public (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;unlike Matt Gaetz’s, at one point&lt;/a&gt;), and all of Biden’s friends on Venmo were removed after &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; contacted the White House for comment, the publication reported. (Venmo gives you the ability to remove contacts, but you have to do it manually.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSuOBJ"&gt;When asked for comment on the situation, Venmo provided the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ikpe77"&gt;The safety and privacy of all Venmo users and their information is always a top priority, and we take this responsibility very seriously.

    <title>Ireland refuses to pay ransom demand in attack on its national health service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TvJpzf1G92EQzXlnKn7tVVcRLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69290111/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="haDdgG"&gt;Ireland’s health service, the HSE, shut down all of its IT systems on Friday following a “significant” ransomware attack which has disrupted COVID-19 testing and other patient services, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57111615"&gt;BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;. The country’s COVID-19 vaccination program does not appear to have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI2Dts"&gt;A government official tells &lt;a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/health/2021/0514/1221624-cyber-attack-hse/"&gt;news station RTE&lt;/a&gt; that an international cyber criminal group is responsible for the attack. “This is not espionage. It was an international attack, but this is just a cyber criminal gang looking for money,” says Minister of State for Public Procurement and eGovernment Ossian Smyth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCrpgC"&gt;Micheál Martin, the country’s Taoiseach (prime minister), says Ireland will not be paying any ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3rIwe9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;'We're very clear we will not be paying any ransom or engaging in any of that sort of stuff' Taoiseach &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichealMartinTD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MichealMartinTD&lt;/a&gt; says of the ransomware attack on the HSE | Live blog: &lt;a href="https://t.co/itscpwqdS7"&gt;https://t.co/itscpwqdS7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Pl4A4JNOST"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pl4A4JNOST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— RTÉ News (@rtenews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1393269632904138757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SHjaxZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed8d3643-1966-45b5-a31c-28dcaf93a65a"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government received a ransom demand to be paid in bitcoin. The attack appeared to affect data stored on the health system’s central servers, reports RTE, but it did not appear any patient data was compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJKmsN"&gt;The HSE tweeted yesterday that it had taken down its IT systems as a precaution to protect them from the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f1mhkJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is a significant ransomware attack on the HSE IT systems. We have taken the precaution of shutting down all our our IT systems in order to protect them from this attack and to allow us fully assess the situation with our own security partners.&lt;/p&gt;— HSE Ireland (@HSELive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HSELive/status/1393090933361623042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cek3IO"&gt;The attack had a severe impact on the country’s health and social care services on Friday, but emergency services continued to operate normally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonnellyStephen/status/1393146117316087808?s=20"&gt;according to health minister Stephen Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;. He reiterated that Ireland’s COVID vaccinations were continuing as planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BLSYd4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today has been a challenging day for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HSELive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HSELive&lt;/a&gt; . But in the midst of such challenge the Vaccination programme continues to perform. Aviva vaccination centre has today surpassed 52,000 vaccinations since they opened - more than the capacity of the stadium! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QJ9lmvg14F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QJ9lmvg14F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stephen Donnelly (@DonnellyStephen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonnellyStephen/status/1393272785733103616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vbiKcG"&gt;The Ireland attack comes less than a week after a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;incident at Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, which took one of the largest fuel pipelines in the US offline. The company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a nearly $5 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to the attackers in that instance, to get its systems back online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple said Roblox developers don’t make games, and now Roblox agrees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puYpnjVwmwA8V3GiN4AUvd-l9BU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289813/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGnpAc"&gt;Massively popular game creation tool &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is now a massively popular &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; creation tool &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, possibly in response to the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RolHtG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; allows a variety of user-created projects on its platform, and until earlier this week, these were all grouped under a tab called “Games” on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s website. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; creators could create and manage “games” through an editor, and individual games had a user limit called “max players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ge5OgK"&gt;That’s all changed now. The “Games” tab now reads “Discover” on the web, although it still points to an address of “roblox.com/games.” Developers can create and manage “experiences,” and experiences have “max people” allowed. The word “game” has been replaced by “experience” across nearly the entire &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; website, and the iOS and Android apps now have a Discover tab instead of a Games tab — although both apps are currently classed as games in their respective stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMHOQp"&gt;“The term ‘experiences’ is consistent with how we’ve evolved our terminology to reflect our realization of the metaverse,” a &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is an online community where people do things together in virtual worlds, and over the years, we began referring to these worlds as experiences, as they better represent the wide range of 3D immersive places – from &lt;a href="https://entertainment-focus.com/2019/09/29/roblox-the-top-5-obbys-you-can-play-right-now/"&gt;obbys&lt;/a&gt; to virtual concerts – that people can enjoy together with their friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMFtj8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has used the term “experience” in place of “game” before, and CEO David Baszucki &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; a “metaverse”&lt;/a&gt; rather than a gaming platform last year. But this change happened days after a legal fight over whether &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experiences are games — and by extension, whether &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself should be allowed on the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y37j5q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Goodbye games, hello Discover&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoJlR8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust trial has produced a weeks-long, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;frequently hilarious debate&lt;/a&gt; over the definition of a video game. Epic wants to prove that its shooter &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a “metaverse” rather than a game, pushing the trial’s scope to cover Apple’s entire App Store instead of just games. Apple wants to prove that Epic is an almost purely game-related company and that the App Store maintains consistent, user-friendly policies distinguishing “apps” from “games.” It also wants to defend a ban on “stores within a store” on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydi3Is"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; blurs the line between a large social game and a game engine or sales platform. Users don’t enter a single virtual world like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;; they launch individual experiences created by users. Developers can sell items within those experiences, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/z3xn4e/how-these-developers-hope-to-build-a-100-person-game-studio-inside-roblox"&gt;full-fledged game studios&lt;/a&gt; that build with &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; instead of, say, the Unity or Unreal engines. But all of this activity happens within a single &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; app, instead of as a series of separately packaged games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxMl0T"&gt;Apple has apparently worried about this fuzziness. In a 2017 email, Apple marketing head Trystan Kosmynka said he was “surprised” that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; (which he referred to as “Roboblox”) had been approved for the App Store. The email chain indicates that App Store reviewers raised concerns in 2014, but &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was approved without ever resolving the issues. Epic brought the decision up again in court, hoping to cast doubt on Apple’s App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ou4gON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Games have a beginning, an end, there’s challenges in place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="odJIMn"&gt;Instead, Kosmynka justified the choice by saying that neither &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; nor its user-built projects should be defined as games. “If you think of a game or app, games are incredibly dynamic, games have a beginning, an end, there’s challenges in place,” he testified. “I look at the experiences that are in Roblox similar to the experiences that are in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft.&lt;/em&gt; These are maps. These are worlds. And they have boundaries in terms of what they’re capable of.” Kosmynka said Apple considered &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself an app (rather than a game) because the company used that label in the App Store, although this doesn’t appear to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4VleQ"&gt;Besides the crucial factors of “beginning,” “end,” and “challenges,” Kosmynka seemingly argued that these experiences weren’t games because &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; contained their code in a safe, Apple-vetted &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; sandbox — making them less objectionable than standalone installable games. But Apple doesn’t use that same logic for cloud gaming services, which stream video of games from remote servers. In fact, it requires these services to list each game as a separate app. That would probably be a nightmare for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, where experiences range from full-fledged professional projects to tiny personal spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XiWw3"&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users have left irritated messages on Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms. But &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has promoted itself as a general-purpose metaverse in the past. It’s  got virtually nothing to gain by deliberately stepping into Apple’s minefield of iOS gaming rules, particularly after such an extended courtroom debate about its status. On iOS, it turns out, the only winning move is to not play — or at least not &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; anyone you’re playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXYQnI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple confirms space gray Magic Keyboards, Trackpads, and Mice are discontinued</title>

  &lt;p id="uAWEl9"&gt;If you want a space gray Apple accessory, such as a Magic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMLA02LL%2FA%2Fmagic-mouse-2-silver%3Ffnode%3Da7a2872d5d1e93997a19660091ca82ba0778b7c4e4abc3f3756ac79e36fea6af4ff30a00ee2def6718a26bf1e1bdb49896cc3244c384a6e3aa79da4ce803666c92ea15356e9f1e3c3f0118c0dcbcbca5b5cbe3b1d7060a6a629724043a5cc306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436719%2Fapple-space-gray-magic-trackpad-keyboard-mouse-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMQ052LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-silver%3Ffnode%3Da7a2872d5d1e93997a19660091ca82ba0778b7c4e4abc3f3756ac79e36fea6af4ff30a00ee2def6718a26bf1e1bdb49896cc3244c384a6e3aa79da4ce803666c92ea15356e9f1e3c3f0118c0dcbcbca5b5cbe3b1d7060a6a629724043a5cc306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436719%2Fapple-space-gray-magic-trackpad-keyboard-mouse-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJ2R2LL%2FA%2Fmagic-trackpad-2-silver%3Ffnode%3Da7a2872d5d1e93997a19660091ca82ba0778b7c4e4abc3f3756ac79e36fea6af4ff30a00ee2def6718a26bf1e1bdb49896cc3244c384a6e3aa79da4ce803666c92ea15356e9f1e3c3f0118c0dcbcbca5b5cbe3b1d7060a6a629724043a5cc306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436719%2Fapple-space-gray-magic-trackpad-keyboard-mouse-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Trackpad&lt;/a&gt;, now is the time to get one because they’re being discontinued. On Apple’s store page, they’re currently for sale but with a “while supplies last” message (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/apple-discontinuing-space-gray-mac-accessories/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it will no longer sell the space gray accessories after stock runs out, but the silver variants will still be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8IkT7"&gt;The message is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;same one that appeared on the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; before it was listed as “out of stock” for good. Now that Apple’s space gray desktop isn’t around, it seems that the company’s decided to stop making the space gray accessories. It’s a bit odd, given that Apple kept the color around when it introduced the M1 MacBooks, where external mice and keyboards might still be in demand. The discontinuation of the dark accessories does raise the question of whether it will stick around in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;rumored redesign&lt;/a&gt;, though, or if Apple will go the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;colorful route it did with the new iMacs&lt;/a&gt;. (Let me buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396502/purple-iphone-12-color-photos-shade-hue-lilac-lavender"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; iPad Pro!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KbcTUu_DOao7BA4DjpQJCYfvvP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515329/Screen_Shot_2021_05_14_at_12.36.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “while supplies last” label only shows up for the space gray version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pr6zX8"&gt;This may also mean the death of the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/12/imac-pro-black-lightning-cable/"&gt;Apple-made black Lightning cable&lt;/a&gt;: Apple doesn’t sell it separately, but it’s included with the space gray accessories and some Beats headphones. Truly, it’s nothing special, but now, there are three less things it comes with. I look forward to selling mine on eBay for some ridiculous price in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDmeATrjmzOdmF7pkmI_ysHUgS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515318/IMG_1497.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may see black, but I’m seeing gold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5KakW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the black Lightning cable only came with Space Gray accessories. It also comes with certain sets of Beats headphones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4RHzp"&gt;Ireland’s High Court has dismissed Facebook’s bid to block a European Union privacy regulation — created by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) — that could interrupt the flow of data from the EU to the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-irish-ruling-on-suspension-of-eu-u-s-data-flows-11620983614?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwlOz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432047/facebook-appealing-ireland-privacy-regulator-data-transfer-us-eu"&gt;Facebook first appealed the order&lt;/a&gt; in part because it claimed the Commission and the EU’s other privacy regulators were moving too quickly and hadn’t given the company appropriate time to respond. Facebook also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the IDPC’s privacy order “would have damaging consequences for the European economy.” Irish officials clearly didn’t share the same concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3gVUl"&gt;The IDPC &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ireland-to-order-facebook-to-stop-sending-user-data-to-u-s-11599671980"&gt;originally created the new privacy order&lt;/a&gt; because Facebook and other international companies often store EU residents’ data on US servers, potentially exposing them to additional surveillance. If EU regulators decide to side with the IDPC, it would mark the first major action against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326795/eu-us-personal-data-transfer-privacy-shield-invalidated-sccs-upheld"&gt;Privacy Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the protocol that allows that data sharing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsJw47"&gt;The commission still needs to submit a final draft of its order to EU privacy regulators, but if it’s approved, it could have a widespread impact on all companies doing trans-Atlantic business online. As the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the order could force Facebook to silo the information it collects from users in the EU or stop serving those countries altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music for Android reveals lossless audio could be imminent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UT15XCqQGfaN_axm_imGPPjKSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289332/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vG0d0x"&gt;Apple might have bigger plans for next week than initially thought. The new iMac, iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K are all set to start shipping to early preorder customers on or around May 21st, but now it seems there could be two surprise announcements: a hi-fi streaming tier of Apple Music, and maybe even AirPods 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VVVA"&gt;The Apple Music part seems extremely likely when you factor in &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-streaming/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Digging into the latest Apple Music for Android beta app, they discovered direct references to high-resolution audio that didn’t exist previously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCJlbD"&gt;These are the prompts found in the app’s code, though they’re not user-facing quite yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8zLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file. Turning this on will consume significantly more data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWWoGL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files will use significantly more space on your device. 10 GB of space could store approximately: – 3000 songs at high quality – 1000 songs with lossless – 200 songs with hi-res lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fbta9x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless streaming will consume significantly more data. A 3-minute song will be approximately: – 1.5 MB with high efficiency- 6 MB with high quality at 256 kbps- 36 MB with lossless at 24-bit/48 kHz- 145 MB with hi-res lossless at 24-bit/192 kHzSupport varies and depends on song availability, network conditions, and connected speaker or headphone capability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rTO1ot"&gt;It doesn’t get much more direct and clear than that, with Apple warning about both the higher data consumption of streaming lossless music and the added storage space that will be necessary to download it for offline listening. The fact that Apple has now added this data to its Android app suggests that this could all be happening sooner than later. I say that because Apple’s Apple One bundle &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/10/apple-one-music-unified-subscription-apk-insight/"&gt;showed up in Apple Music for Android&lt;/a&gt; just days before its public announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFONBz"&gt;The Android app code also reveals that Apple Music will offer two choices for lossless playback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYi573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/48 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvETqM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-Res Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/192 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oArq2e"&gt;So it sounds like Apple has every intention of matching what Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and services like Qobuz currently deliver. It’s also worth noting that there’ve been recent references to Dolby Atmos spatial audio in Apple Music on iOS, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/01/ios-14-6-beta-1-hinted-at-apple-music-hifi-support-with-dolby-audio-references/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IdUGhC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has stuck with 256kbps AAC since 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDgS0"&gt;Apple has for years stuck to its customary 256kbps AAC files for both iTunes and Apple Music. When &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes Plus debuted all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, that was a substantial upgrade over heavily compressed MP3s that people were downloading from peer-to-peer apps like Napster and Limewire during the height of music piracy. And it’s still perfectly adequate. Mastering of tracks has just as much influence on the listening experience as encoding details do, and Apple has tried to play to this aspect with its “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fitunes%2Fmastered-for-itunes%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Digital Masters&lt;/a&gt;,” which aim to get the most dynamic range and detail from songs on its platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZisbz"&gt;But in terms of pure music fidelity, Apple has objectively been surpassed by companies like Tidal and Amazon over the last several years. My friend Micah Singleton has &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9572851/music-streaming-hi-fi-resolution-amazon-spotify-apple/"&gt;a great piece over at &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how we’re entering the hi-fi era of the streaming music wars. Amazon Music HD is performing strongly, with subscriptions up 100 percent year over year. Spotify has also promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;the launch of “Spotify HiFi”&lt;/a&gt; for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lJ89M"&gt;There’s money to be made, and the ingredients are all there: Apple now sells premium headphones in the AirPods Max, and wireless carriers continue to talk up the promise and speeds of their growing 5G networks. I can’t imagine 5G will be &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for lossless Apple Music streaming, but it’s a nice flex of the technology right in the middle of the iPhone 12 cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o9Z79u"&gt;What about those AirPods 3, though?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OwVM0N"&gt;There have already been quite a few leaks that revealed details about &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/"&gt;Apple’s next iteration of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the real question has been around release timing. Yesterday, a report from a site called &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/rumor-suggests-new-airpods-coming-next-week/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleTrack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the new AirPods could be announced alongside this new lossless tier of Apple Music. I don’t quite follow the logic, myself; no one really thinks of regular AirPods as the right choice for audiophile listening, but maybe Apple just wants new hardware of some sort to launch in tandem with the new service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G5Hh1"&gt;Taken on its own, the AirPods rumor seems “sketchy” as &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/13/sketchy-rumor-claims-apple-will-launch-airpods-3-on-may-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. But the sudden discoveries about lossless audio in Apple Music for Android seem to add some fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A driverless Waymo got stuck in traffic and then tried to run away from its support crew</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzPEMtNZHBD51Zh0ICpCnI_fa9Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289249/vpavic_181127_3122_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZ30lS"&gt;One of Waymo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;fully autonomous minivans&lt;/a&gt; got stuck at an intersection in Chandler, Arizona, prompting the company to send a roadside assistance team to come extract it. But when the crew arrived, the vehicle started to drive away before pulling over and completely blocking a three-lane road. It was a rare moment captured on video of one of Waymo’s driverless vehicles performing erratically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KifZs"&gt;The incident was recorded from inside the vehicle by Joel Johnson, who publishes videos on YouTube under the handle &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JJRicksStudios/featured"&gt;JJRicks Studios&lt;/a&gt; about his experiences using Waymo’s Level 4 autonomous vehicles, which operate without a safety driver behind the wheel. Johnson’s video is a rare unedited look at what happens when one of the world’s most proficient autonomous vehicles gets tripped up by a few orange safety cones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aayK8v"&gt;“It’s no longer stranded and now it’s blocking, okay,” a remote operator is heard saying to Johnson at one point in the video, to which he replies, “Well, this is interesting!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="orKVND"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdKCQKBvH-A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zf8bBR"&gt;The Alphabet-owned company has approximately 600 vehicles as part of its fleet. More than 300 vehicles operate in an approximately 100-square-mile service area that includes the towns of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe — though its fully driverless cars are restricted to an area that is only half that size. (Waymo hasn’t disclosed how many of its vehicles operate without safety drivers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ibdzvM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When one of the world’s most proficient autonomous vehicles gets tripped up by a few orange safety cones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddIYHN"&gt;In late 2018, the company launched a limited public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126103/waymo-one-self-driving-taxi-service-ride-safety-alphabet-cost-app"&gt;ride-hailing service called Waymo One&lt;/a&gt;, but the only customers to get access were people who had first been vetted through Waymo’s early rider program of beta testers. Waymo said it has around 1,500 monthly active users from both programs, the same number it reported in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1flSa"&gt;Waymo has a team of remote employees that watch the real-time feeds of each vehicle’s eight cameras and can help, with the push of a button, if the software runs into a difficult spot and needs a human eye to figure out what’s going on. But the company claims that the remote assistance team can’t “joystick” the vehicles, only offer suggestions to help extract the car from tough situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ0svy"&gt;One of those situations emerged in Johnson’s recent ride. The car wanted to make a right turn onto a street that had orange cones blocking that lane of traffic, which apparently confused the vehicle. In a statement provided to Johnson, Waymo said that it “detected an unusual situation and requested the attention of a remote fleet response specialist to provide additional information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki2Pbu"&gt;Where things got hairy is that apparently the remote specialist “provided incorrect guidance, which made it challenging for the Waymo driver to resume its intended route, and required Waymo’s roadside assistance team to complete the trip,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOtm96"&gt;The remote operator tells Johnson that Waymo doesn’t assign a roadside assistance team to trail each of its fully autonomous vehicles in case something goes wrong. Crews are usually “two to five miles out,” she said. “It never was assigned one-to-one.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3Zbkmo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Crews are usually “two to five miles out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YOvtN"&gt;At this point in the video, the car starts to reverse from its position where it was slightly blocking the road to a spot where it was more fully clogging traffic. It then stops again, as if unsure how to proceed. The wheel turns slightly to the right on its own, but nothing happens. “Very interesting,” Johnson says, gamely watching this all happen from one of the middle captain seats. “Now it’s blocking the whole lane instead of half of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKG7Y5"&gt;Meanwhile, a flatbed truck drives passed collecting all of the orange cones that originally confused the Waymo car. And right when the roadside assistance crew arrives, the vehicle suddenly decides to hightail it out of its embarrassing situation. Johnson sounds disappointed that he never gets to interact with Waymo’s team of roving problem-solvers as the car speeds away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DcDfC"&gt;But oh, no! More orange cones appear, and the Waymo vehicle slows down and then stops again. The roadside crew eventually shows up, and the car tries to run away again. But eventually, it surrenders, and everything gets worked out. The whole video is worth watching if you want an inside look at what happens when our driverless future confronts the intractable problem of minor road construction. &lt;/p&gt;
