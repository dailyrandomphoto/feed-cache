    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCrdsb"&gt;If you’re hunting for an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, Newegg has an appealing sale happening on bundles that will net you a free accessory. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4237997%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $350&lt;/a&gt;, you can get the 64GB headset (normally $300 by itself) with Logitech’s G333 VR wired earbuds and the Oculus Elite strap. Both accessories would usually add $100 to the total, but with this bundle, you’re saving $49, so it’s like you’re getting the ever-useful and comfortable Elite strap for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IDrpq7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8gLpC"&gt;Newegg has other bundles that might appeal to you more. It has one that includes the headset with the Logitech earbuds and the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up carrying case instead of the Elite strap. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238013%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This one costs a total of $359&lt;/a&gt;, so you’re paying just $10 for the case instead of $50. The other great bundle &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238012%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;option for $349&lt;/a&gt; includes the headset, earbuds, and Oculus’ fit pack with a pair of light blockers and two alternate-width facial interfaces made for “users with low nose bridges and wider or narrower cheekbones,” as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Faccessories%2Fquest-2-fit-pack%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ site says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

This gadget usually costs $50, and it might suit you perfectly if you need a bedside alarm with some smarts. Its display shows the time, weather conditions, and current alarms, and it doesn’t take up much space. It also has a USB-A port around its back that you can charge a device through. It can play music, but it won’t be a suitable stand-in for the Google Nest Audio, as its speaker isn’t nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjI1SN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273272"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgvNl6"&gt;One of Amazon’s deals of the day is a sizable discount on its Fire HD 8 tablet with 32GB of storage that comes bundled with the Blink Mini camera. It’s normally $125 if you pay full price for both products, but you can snag them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B08XV5X86G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 right now (and for the rest of Monday, April 19th) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738214635752240878#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is in on the deal, too, if you prefer to shop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="79IOtc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s xCloud beta arrives on iOS and PC this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTwTFZnR1vcgK1mUPdLdZ1a0Noo=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149306/iPhone_iPad_Surface_2021_04_14_1920x1080_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFhN71"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) is officially arriving on iOS and PC today. The service will arrive on devices via browsers, allowing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play Xbox games on iPhones, iPads, and PCs. Microsoft is keeping this beta rather limited though, and requiring players to be invited to participate in the testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl7H2c"&gt;The service will be accessible at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.com%2Fplay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F19%2F22391561%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;www.xbox.com/play&lt;/a&gt;, where Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers that have been invited to the beta will be able to play Xbox games through Edge, Chrome, or Safari browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Np1o"&gt;It’s the first time Xbox Game Streaming has been available on iOS devices after the service launched exclusively on Android phones and tablets last year. Microsoft wasn’t able to offer xCloud on iPhones or iPads during the initial launch phase of the service back in September, due to Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV739"&gt;Both Apple and Microsoft got into a public war of words over xCloud, and Apple initially insisted that Microsoft would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;submit individual games for review&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;offered a compromise&lt;/a&gt;  to allow cloud gaming apps to run on iOS with individually reviewed games, but Microsoft branded it a “bad experience for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvMqVg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfO4Id"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku Voice Remote Pro review: a nice upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Roku’s new $30 remote has upgrades like a rechargeable battery and hands-free voice commands&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0cwfK6"&gt;Roku’s new Voice Remote Pro is the company’s first remote control to come with always-listening mics built in. These let you easily launch a streaming app or find the remote itself, should it get lost in the couch cushions, using just your voice. The new $29.99 remote, a standalone purchase that works with Roku streamers and Roku TVs, also has a headphone jack for private listening and includes buttons for controlling your TV’s power and volume. And to round it all out, Roku throws in two customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to remember any voice command and repeat it with a press. Perhaps best of all, you won’t need to hunt for AA batteries anymore: the Voice Remote Pro replaces them with a rechargeable battery that can last for up to two months on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdCTlX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10453604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgUOrh"&gt;It definitely looks the part of a Roku remote. Weight-wise, the Voice Remote Pro felt about the same in my hand as the remote that came with my TCL Roku TV. But instead of a removable back cover, there’s a Micro USB port at the bottom of this one. Yes, I very much wish it was a USB-C jack instead, but Roku chose the older plug. Either way, it’s largely hidden from view when you’re using the remote since it’s behind the purple Roku tag. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HaPcAUj7ZlWDFyzeWB01zt2rf_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448507/DSCF3627_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Voice Remote Pro has a rechargeable battery that uses a Micro USB connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fdVvS1"&gt;On the left side is a 3.5mm jack that will pass the audio from your Roku TV or Roku streaming device to whatever headphones you plug in. Private listening remains a huge convenience, though other platforms like the Chromecast with Google TV, Fire TV, and Apple TV support Bluetooth earbuds to achieve the same end result; if you need to keep a room quiet but still want to enjoy a show or movie, you can have your own private bubble of sound without disturbing others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1LRUp"&gt;There’s another new addition on the remote’s left side: Roku has included a sliding switch to enable or turn off the Voice Remote Pro’s always-listening mode. Some people aren’t comfortable with microphones constantly being on in their home and listening for a wake phrase. If you switch off hands-free mode, you can still press and hold the microphone button on the front of the remote to speak commands. On the right side are a volume rocker and mute button. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x2xABclZAR__aqRhVuByj7iNmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448504/DSCF3622_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a slider switch to enable or turn off the always-listening mics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqOBVN"&gt;All of the buttons on the face of the Voice Remote Pro are the same size as those on my TCL Roku remote, though this remote is a bit taller since it adds two programmable buttons above the four branded shortcut buttons. Roku’s marketing images show an Apple TV Plus button alongside Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. But the remote I received to review actually had Sling TV on there instead of Apple’s service. Roku tells me it’ll be changing this in future shipments, which I take as a sign of how recently its deal with Apple came together. The buttons aren’t remappable, so if you want the Apple one, it’s probably best to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH22OJ"&gt;Some people don’t mind these branded buttons since they’re easy to use and straightforward: others complain that there’s always some app or service in the foursome that they either don’t have or never use. Sometimes the buttons manage to outlive their advertised services: Roku has had Blockbuster, PlayStation Vue, and Rdio on its remotes before — all services that no longer exist. I can understand both arguments, but considering how much money Roku rakes in from those quick-access shortcuts, the sponsored buttons are here to stay. Thankfully, Roku has at least made a good decision by including two customizable buttons to go along with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB4EZ8"&gt;The buttons labeled “1” and “2” can save any voice command that Roku supports; just long-press either button after the voice command, and it’ll be set as that button’s function. This can be as simple as using them as two shortcuts for apps that don’t have their own button, like “open HBO Max” or “open Peacock.” But you can also use the shortcut buttons for searches (“show me free movies”), input selection (“switch to antenna TV”), or TV controls (“turn the volume up,” “turn on closed captioning”). I like the flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xp843ZLmWbghXya4K7OYdABcSpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448505/DSCF3623_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Apple TV Plus button will eventually replace Sling TV on the Voice Remote Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2aFOkg"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro’s built-in microphones did a fine job picking up my voice when on the coffee table several feet away from me; I didn’t have to shout or over-enunciate anything for my voice commands to register successfully. Roku says the “mid-field microphones” can work at distances up to 12 feet, but at that point, you’d probably need to raise your voice some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8uVFp"&gt;Don’t expect Roku’s voice platform to be a replacement for the Google Assistant or Alexa, though. Aside from opening channels or searching for content, it’s all still rudimentary stuff. You can ask it what the time is, but it can’t give you the weather. “Turn the volume up” worked perfectly on my TCL Roku TV, but “turn the brightness down” didn’t. Certain apps like Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max can &lt;a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694"&gt;start playing content directly after a voice request&lt;/a&gt;, but “watch&lt;em&gt; The Crown&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix” requires you to click in from the voice search result. (You can say “Hey Roku, OK” to select whatever’s currently highlighted, so you can technically still start watching using only your voice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="p55tAn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VbN9CN"&gt;“Hey Roku, find the remote” easily proved to be my favorite voice command. Assuming the remote is in a spot where it can hear you say that, it’ll emit a sound for 60 seconds or until you press a button to indicate it’s been found. The Roku Ultra has a button on the streaming box itself for this purpose, but this is even easier — assuming you’re okay with the always-on mics. You can also trigger the remote beeping with Roku’s smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xacziY"&gt;Amazon recently announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348578/amazon-ruins-fire-tv-remote-netflix-disney-hulu-buttons"&gt;adding sponsored shortcut buttons to the Fire TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, and that means Roku and Amazon are pretty much identical when it comes to clicker functionality. Both can control your TV’s power and volume, both have the dedicated sponsored buttons. Roku’s Voice Remote Pro pulls ahead with the customizable buttons that Amazon’s remote lacks, however. And Amazon still requires you to press and hold the mic button for Alexa commands; there’s no hands-free option. It’s a bit surprising that Roku beat Amazon to a remote that you can talk to from across the room, though the Fire TV Cube builds hands-free commands into the streaming device itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxvxMurv6zxnr22QOYTFGtxpaRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448508/DSCF3628_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get two customizable shortcut buttons that can open any app you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5LIEG"&gt;Roku’s Voice Remote Pro is being released just after Logitech confirmed that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377015/logitech-discontinues-harmony-universal-remotes"&gt;finished making Harmony remotes&lt;/a&gt;. And in part, these streaming remotes are why; thanks to HDMI-CEC, they can cover enough ground for a lot of people that universal remotes aren’t the essential living room gadgets they were 10 years ago. And TVs are increasingly getting “smarter” with built-in support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, so you can include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4XuWb"&gt;Purely from an ergonomic standpoint, my favorite streaming player remote remains Nvidia’s backlit remote for the Shield TV. Yes, it’s got a Netflix button — but that’s it for sponsored buttons. And Nvidia lets you fully customize what the settings button does. You can decide what a single tap, press and hold, or double press will do. These can be set to open different apps if you want, or you can pick from many other functions. There’s no headphone jack, and Nvidia is still using regular old AA batteries, so Roku still comes out ahead in some ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2ziUE"&gt;The Apple TV remote steers clear of streaming app buttons, but it’s too small, easily lost in the far reaches of the couch, and just not great to use. Google’s remote for the latest Chromecast is simple enough, but the furthest it goes with “customizable” buttons is letting you choose which YouTube app — YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Kids, YouTube Music, etc. — the YouTube button will open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyuSSk"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro is the best execution of a Roku remote so far, even if it can’t approach the scope of what a Harmony is capable of. The programmable buttons, private listening, and hands-free voice commands are enough to justify the $29.99 price and upgrade from a standard Roku remote. Not everyone will be comfortable with a remote that’s always listening to them, but with the money you’ll save on batteries, it basically pays for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctors are testing a prescription video game for COVID-19 ‘brain fog’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Akili CEO plays the company’s video game on an iPad. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gFIF4uS_sdl_QGdGOVsfGYCskUg=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148999/496533132.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Akili Interactive video game.  | Photo by Dina Rudick/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m71F2M"&gt;A research team is testing a prescription video game to see if it can help people who have lingering memory and attention problems after recovering from COVID-19. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html"&gt;Many people&lt;/a&gt; who survived the disease say that they’re often confused and have difficulty focusing, and research studies show that the symptoms can stick around for months after they recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXfVRb"&gt;Faith Gunning, a neuropsychologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, thinks the &lt;a href="https://www.endeavorrx.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EndeavorRX&lt;/em&gt; video game&lt;/a&gt; might be able to treat some of those symptoms. The game, made by Akili Interactive, made history last summer when it became the first video game to get the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;sign-off&lt;/a&gt; to be prescribed as a medical treatment. It’s cleared as a treatment for kids between the ages of eight and 12 with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZdaXf"&gt;But Gunning thinks it could help other groups of people. “I was already interested in the game,” she says. Then, she started to see the signs that people who had COVID-19 might be struggling with some of the same symptoms the game can target. She’s &lt;a href="https://jcto.weill.cornell.edu/open_clinical_trials/improving-cognitive-health-in-covid-19-survivors-through-digital-therapeutics"&gt;launching a study&lt;/a&gt; to test if it can help those patients. One group of people who had COVID-19 and have cognitive problems will play the game, and the study will check if their symptoms improve more than a group of COVID-19 survivors with similar symptoms who don’t play the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fItUxj"&gt;“We need more interventions in general, in cognitive and mental health, that we can get out into the community,” Gunning says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl2WOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Gunning about why the game, if it proves to be effective, could be one good strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjoEAL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMI1uI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of cognitive issues are you seeing in people who have had COVID-19? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPWikI"&gt;We did a study on patients following an infection with COVID-19. I’m going to give the caveat that these are individuals who required hospitalization and had rehab before they were discharged home. So these were individuals who had moderate to severe COVID-19 — so it’s not representative of the general population. What we found is that a very high percentage of individuals had disturbances that ranged from mild to severe in their cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEzpM4"&gt;We found a pattern that included things like disruption in attention and in the ability to do more than one thing at once. We found a high percentage had difficulty with working memory, which is the ability to hold information in your head while doing something else. All of these are skills that are important for everything we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WEwFt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you interested in the Akili Interactive video game? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NguLgn"&gt;The game has always intrigued me. I’d already been working with the video game for a few years. It really does target an important function: the ability to do more than one thing at a time. It improves it, and we’ve seen the game improve it in people with ADHD, in older adults, and there’s some indication it helps in people with multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz2CLY"&gt;It targets these really important cognitive skills, and it’s really engaging. One of the issues that you often find with cognitive interventions is that, frankly, they’re boring. So people won’t do them. And if people won’t do them, they’re not going to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bspQe4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has your non-COVID-19 research on this video game found? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCfN49"&gt;We’re using it in older adults who have some cognitive issues and middle-aged and older adults who have depression and some other cognitive issues. And what we’ve found is that those people do show changes in their brains. We showed that there’s improvement in connectivity within brain networks that support attention and executive skills, and we have some preliminary data showing improvement in mood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8hUKB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think this could help COVID-19 survivors? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAHig"&gt;We don’t think everybody who’s recovering from COVID-19 needs cognitive intervention. But there is enough data that suggests that a significant number of people who have suffered from COVID-19 will have some cognitive issues. These disturbances aren’t just specific to people recovering from COVID-19; we see them across a lot of conditions that impact the brain. I think if we can improve those functions, regardless of what’s causing them, we can improve their daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKIBnR"&gt;We’re looking for two main outcomes: cognitive skills and daily functioning. Because really, that’s the goal. We’re talking about COVID-19 disrupting people’s ability to function in their everyday lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9r0yE"&gt;A video game is also scalable. It’s something that can be given to lots of people. We need things we can get out into the community. Even if it’s a small subset of people who had COVID-19, the sheer number of people who had COVID-19 means we need interventions that are effective and can be disseminated widely. We’re not going to have the workforce to have one-on-one cognitive intervention for all the people who were sick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo will provide cars for Didi’s autonomous vehicle division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-NZhHEq4bZoXy6Rfk3VFbGKEcY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148794/Volvo_XC90_DiDi_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbDuUc"&gt;Volvo will provide vehicles for Didi Chuxing’s self-driving taxi fleet, according to a new deal between the two companies. The Swedish automaker, which is owned by China’s largest private automaker Geely, will supply XC90 SUVs to Didi Autonomous Driving, the self-driving technology division of China’s vehicle-for-hire company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtEo0a"&gt;Didi said it would use Volvo’s SUVs when it eventually launches a commercial robotaxi operation at a later date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20840954/china-didi-chuxing-self-driving-car-robot-taxi-launch-experiment-shanghai"&gt;The company has been testing its autonomous technology in Shanghai since 2019&lt;/a&gt; as part of a pilot approved by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRX9P"&gt;It’s an interesting twist, considering Volvo used to be a partner in another global ride-hailing firm’s autonomous ambitions. Volvo had an agreement with Uber to deploy a fleet of self-driving taxis by 2019, but that plan was scrapped after an Uber test vehicle (an XC90 SUV) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174636/uber-self-driving-crash-fatal-arizona-update"&gt;struck and killed a pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; in Tempe, Arizona, in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RqOiCb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an interesting twist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXzDlA"&gt;Still, the Swedish automaker maintained its partnership with Uber’s autonomous division, announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662626/uber-volvo-self-driving-car-safety-autonomous-factory-level"&gt;a jointly developed self-driving version of the Volvo XC90 SUV&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Last year, under pressure from investors, Uber sold its autonomous division to self-driving startup Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu6DLp"&gt;Notably, Volvo says the vehicles it will be supplying to Didi will be “equipped with necessary backup systems for functions such as steering and braking.” Those functions, such as automatic emergency braking, were disabled by Uber in the self-driving SUV that killed the pedestrian in Arizona in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrZhZX"&gt;Didi isn’t the only company to use Volvo’s Swedish engineered vehicles as part of a robotaxi fleet. Waymo, the self-driving division of Alphabet, announced last year that it would be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303324/volvo-waymo-l4-deal-electric-self-driving-robot-taxi"&gt;“exclusive global L4 partner”&lt;/a&gt; for Volvo and its sub-brands Polestar and Lynk &amp;amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUWRdE"&gt;Volvo also has plans to sell customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;partially automated vehicles equipped with LIDAR sensors made by US startup Luminar&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker said its vehicles will be able to drive themselves on highways hands-free, with no human intervention, and will start rolling off the production line in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYg13v"&gt;Didi started its ride-hailing business in China in 2012. It nabbed $1 billion from &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11669178/apple-invests-1-billion-in-chinese-transportation-service-didi-chuxing"&gt;Apple in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the same time it was locked in an intense competition with Uber for China’s rapidly growing ride-hail market and had started poaching engineers from Silicon Valley to come work for its nascent self-driving program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74lcXr"&gt;Eventually, the battle grew too costly for Uber, which was reportedly burning through $1 billion a year to compete with the Chinese firm. In August 2016, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12339950/uber-didi-chuxing-china-merge"&gt;sell Uber’s Chinese business to Didi&lt;/a&gt; for a 17.7 percent stake in Didi and a seat on the company’s board. In exchange, Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHSdt"&gt;Didi has also invested in many of Uber’s rivals, including Lyft, India’s Ola, Singapore-headquartered Grab, Estonia’s Taxify, Careem in the Middle East (which was later acquired by Uber), and Brazil’s 99. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16748178/didi-chuxing-mexico-expand-ride-hail-uber"&gt;expanded into Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, intensifying its global rivalry with Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Qv1Mn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is making it easier to export text posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMN9DlW580ilPCiEPYhQ6dVQIe8=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148632/DataPortabilityGIF.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbAIdj"&gt;Facebook is rolling out a new feature today, allowing users across the globe to have the option to archive their posts and notes created on the social media site and transfer a copy of that data onto Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger. It’s expanding on a similar tool the company released last year that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241093/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data"&gt;transfer photos from its platform onto Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the tool allows users leaving Facebook to preserve a version of the content associated with their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6FvjV"&gt;Users can access the tool by opening Facebook settings and clicking on “Your Facebook Information,” then selecting “Transfer a Copy of Your Information.” There, you can select which destination to transfer the data to (Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger), log in to the account you select, and confirm the transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaLIwh"&gt;The new feature is part of the Data Transfer Project, a cross-company data-sharing initiative that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"&gt;launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of allowing you to move data across various online services and platforms seamlessly. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are also involved in the project, offering similar data-export tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vi9gfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook hopes to advance the conversation with policymakers, developers, and experts regarding data portability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omsDXY"&gt;The feature is convenient for users who want to share specific posts or notes they created through Facebook. Still, it is important to note that data ported will not archive comments from other users since those comments are seen as belonging to a separate account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0xhwh"&gt;The new data export tools help bring Facebook in line with two recent tech regulation laws — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California’s Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; and the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Both laws require that companies provide personal information in a readily usable format upon request, although the specifics of the format and interoperability measures are left unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pQDBf8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about GDPR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"},{"title":"No one is ready for California’s new consumer privacy law","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"},{"title":"Facebook’s new tool makes it easy to transfer photos and videos to Google Photos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241093/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter achieves historic powered flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bczUGNi9xolJo7xKvCbsRPHD36o=/0x52:1310x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148358/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_6.54.46_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image from Ingenuity’s historic flight on Mars, showing the helicopter’s shadow as it hovers midair.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dZYqV"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter nailed a successful debut test flight on Mars, engineers confirmed early Monday morning. The tiny spacecraft lifted itself 10 feet off the Martian surface for 39 seconds, marking the first powered flight on another world. The historic demonstration opens up tantalizing possibilities for a new mode of planetary travel that could send future rotorcraft far beyond the reach of traditional rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Opmu"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity helicopter lifted its tissue box-sized body at 12:34PM Mars time (3:34AM ET, Earth time), spinning its twin rotor blades to achieve its first flight in the ultrathin atmosphere of Mars. Those blades spun faster than 2,500 rpm — much faster than the roughly 500 rpm helicopters need to fly on Earth. The craft hovered for about 30 seconds above the surface before descending for touchdown, concluding a fully autonomous 39.1-second flight test, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PxuYz"&gt;The rotorcraft arrived on the Red Planet, 173 million miles from Earth, on February 18th, clinging to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover. It was deployed from Perseverance over a month later, on April 4th, starting a 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests. Monday’s successful flight sets the stage for more ambitious attempts in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIwoXS"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory broke out in cheers upon confirmation that Ingenuity’s flight attempt appeared flawless. “Confirmed, that Ingenuity has performed its first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet,” Ingenuity chief pilot Håvard Grip declared, prompting applause inside JPL Mission Control. “We can now say that humans beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,” Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung told NASA engineers in the room after confirmation of the helicopter’s successful flight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6lxYIh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A red-letter day on the Red Planet! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qow8JwhYEo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Qow8JwhYEo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384099533026566148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk1I97"&gt;“This gives us amazing hope for all of humanity. I couldn’t be more proud,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate NASA administrator for science, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1384102594319032329"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successful confirmation, Zurbuchen said NASA named Ingenuity’s flight zone Wright Brothers Field, as a nod to the Wright brothers’ revolutionary flight in 1903 and “in recognition of the ingenuity and innovation that continue to propel exploration.” The helicopter carries on its body a postage stamp-sized piece of the Wright brothers’ iconic plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQpgv6"&gt;A black-and-white image from Ingenuity’s down-facing navigation camera was the first visual confirmation of the copter’s flight, showing the experimental craft’s shadow from roughly 10 feet above the surface. Minutes after flight confirmation, a sequence of images taken by Perseverance, watching from about 211 feet away, arrived at Mission Control and put Ingenuity’s flight in motion for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fv7fr3cMhaETmkz8j1V2PJkFw3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453946/Apr_19_2021_07_01_51.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingenuity soared 10 feet off the ground over Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyg7DV"&gt;The flight was delayed a few times from April 11th, with one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;delay last week&lt;/a&gt; requiring engineers to reupload Ingenuity’s entire flight software after running into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; during preflight tests. The helicopter has a running track-shaped flight zone at Mars’ Jezero Crater, the site of a dried-out lakebed that Perseverance will scour for signs of past microbial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOh6Mg"&gt;Ingenuity’s main mission is to demonstrate flight, with no objectives to explore Mars or carry out science experiments. Those jobs are reserved for Perseverance, whose primary life-hunting mission involves caching Martian soil samples that a future rover will send back to Earth as early as 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2dRYq"&gt;Engineers will analyze loads of data from Ingenuity’s first flight to set the parameters for its next four flights in the coming weeks, with the second one scheduled for April 22nd, NASA said. For those tests, Ingenuity will soar higher and travel across its flight zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzyrLT"&gt;“Like the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, we know that our time to make a difference at Jezero Crater, Mars is not yet over,” Aung told engineers in Mission Control. “This is just the first great flight.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge is getting a performance mode to improve RAM, CPU, and battery usage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1SCbdG1Vo4W5W353-EGjZOmDAL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148345/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PNiLU4"&gt;Microsoft is testing out a new performance mode for its Edge browser. The new mode is available to some testers using the Microsoft Edge Canary version of the browser, and others can enable it manually with a flag. “Performance mode helps you optimize speed, responsiveness, memory, CPU and battery usage,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/introducing-performance-mode-in-microsoft-edge-new-feature/m-p/2270856"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “Performance improvements might vary depending on your individual specifications and browser habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiWHiB"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how the performance mode changes Edge, but it does affect the Sleeping Tabs feature. If you enable performance mode then the Sleeping Tabs timeout will be locked to five minutes. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242622/microsoft-edge-new-themes-icons-sleeping-tabs-feature"&gt;introduced sleeping tabs in Edge&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, allowing the browser to automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a number of tabs open, which helps new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlkSzm"&gt;Performance mode in Edge will likely prove most useful for laptop users, as browsers can often have a big impact on battery life. Google has also been working on improving Chrome performance and battery usage over the past six months. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;update in November&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved CPU usage, and an update earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326952/google-chrome-89-resource-efficiency-memory-hog-startup-speed-improvements"&gt;improved RAM and GPU usage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="h2DFbY"&gt;Andrew Bosworth, VP at Facebook’s Reality Labs, has given some more hints as to what’s in store for future Oculus hardware. In an audio Q&amp;amp;A with John Carmack on Twitter Spaces &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-oculus-quest-pro/"&gt;transcribed by &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bosworth suggested that while last year’s Quest 2 will be sticking around for some time yet, the company is working on headsets with greater capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAEIn3"&gt;“People are also asking about the Quest 3, which doesn’t exist yet, and [for] everyone who is listening to us who is a reporter — there isn’t a Quest 3, there’s only a Quest 2.” Bosworth said. “But I did hint at an &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-pro-facebook-bosworth/"&gt;AMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year about Quest Pro because we do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still. It’s still not gonna happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9KI16"&gt;“For those who are curious, Quest 2 is going to be in the market for a while — for a long while,” Bosworth continued. “And it’s going to be, you know, I think the best bet for the most accessible way to get into VR and have a great experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DX3zSs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HsYxmH"&gt;The discussion is particularly relevant right now because last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;Facebook announced the first title that’s exclusive to the Quest 2 headset — &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; won’t run on the original Quest. While the Quest 2 hardware is significantly more powerful than its predecessor, the announcement could have made owners of either headset wary about Facebook’s long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7sQzi"&gt;Carmack, now a consulting technical officer at Facebook, said he was “supportive of Quest 2-only exclusives but believes there’s “still a pretty substantial market there in Quest 1 users.” Bosworth agreed, saying “I expect the incentives to be for developers to support Quest 1, absolutely. You are unlocking, you know, seven figures of additional users who could potentially buy your software — which is a pretty good deal when you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHioH"&gt;“The formal answer is that we may eventually allow developers who have really high-end apps to target Quest 2 alone, but our very strong recommendation is to support both, and that’s actually what we expect to have happen based on historical norms,” Bosworth added, implying that the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; situation may not be all that common for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi teases the future of its electric sedans with the A6 E-Tron concept</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBWv1IegZJ4UCvqs7PRWGwH_Obo=/100x180:1984x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148007/XS21Outdoor52201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTE8rI"&gt;Audi has debuted a concept version of an all-electric A6 sedan, which is coming to all major global markets and will be built on a new EV platform the company is co-developing with Porsche. A production version won’t be revealed until at least the second half of 2022, but the German automaker is targeting around 700 kilometers (more than 400 miles) of range for the new car, which will be called the A6 E-Tron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWqNvt"&gt;The A6 E-Tron concept Audi showed off on Monday at Auto Shanghai 2021 is pretty straightforward as far as concepts go, which is in keeping with how the automaker has handled these reveals lately. To wit, the Q4 E-Tron electric SUV that Audi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;debuted just last week&lt;/a&gt; is a dead ringer for the “concept” version it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251528/audi-q4-etron-ev-concept-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;first showed off at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;. While there are plenty more details and specifics to be learned about the production A6 E-Tron — including price — what we’re seeing now will likely translate closely to what will eventually go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCjLFo"&gt;That includes not only a really healthy range target (thanks to a battery pack capacity of “around 100kWh,” according to Audi), but a fresh take on the A6’s sporty sedan look, as well as a bunch of high-tech upgrades, especially to Audi’s lighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2kZdv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Audi is building its electric vehicles on many different platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjJGez"&gt;First, though, a note on that underlying EV platform. Audi and Porsche call it the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE. The two Volkswagen Group companies first started &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/04/02/audi-porsche-ppe-platform-electric-cars/"&gt;talking about it around a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s slated to power the larger vehicles in Audi’s and Porsche’s forthcoming electric stables. It’s at least the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; different EV platform Audi is building its electric cars on. Audi adapted one of its internal combustion platforms to include batteries and electric motors for the original E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback. Audi is using the Porsche Taycan’s J1 platform to power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;the E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s building the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Q4 E-Tron and Q4 Sportback E-Tron&lt;/a&gt; on Volkswagen’s modular MEB platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yfhsyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10453761"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt1o1S"&gt;A lot of this ultimately won’t matter much to consumers, as it’s not like these Audi EVs will say “powered by Porsche” on the steering wheel or the exterior badging. But there are vast resources in the Volkswagen Group — especially as it tries to break Tesla’s early hold on the EV market — and Audi is clearly trying to leverage the best of what’s being developed across the larger conglomerate to make a big mark with its electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wp4wt1"&gt;That’s not to say Audi isn’t doing its own work. The company has spent years developing electric motor technology for its motorsports division (including fielding a team in the all-electric racing series Formula E). And in the A6 E-Tron concept, Audi says it’s even going to squeeze an extra few miles out of the PPE’s battery pack thanks to a special paint that can reflect “a significant percentage of the thermal radiation in sunlight,” meaning drivers will have to rely less on the air conditioning system, which can draw a significant amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YCPyu"&gt;And anyway, Audi’s cars and SUV’s are as much about the premium in-car experience as they are about what powers them. With that in mind, Audi is touting some notable upgrades to its already advanced lighting tech with the A6 E-Tron concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rysiAL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An upgrade to Audi’s already advanced lighting systems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtaKnF"&gt;For one thing, the company says its so-called “Digital Matrix LED” headlights (which are only available outside the US) have gained new capabilities. These lights, which use a complex shutter system to sculpt the LED light into specific shapes and animations, can now project an Audi-developed video game on a nearby wall or garage door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2oyxu"&gt;Four LED projectors in the corners of the vehicle can create turn signal animations on the road. And three of them embedded in each side of the bodywork can do everything from present welcome messages on the ground for the driver and their passengers, to warn cyclists that a door is about to open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfQD18"&gt;Sedan sales have practically cratered in the US as buyers continue to be swayed by the high seating position and storage space of SUVs and trucks. Car companies — Audi included — are also incentivized to push consumers into these vehicles, which are typically profit centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJODiP"&gt;As high-end automakers push further into electric vehicles, though, they’re apparently willing to bet they can still make the case for these low-slung luxury vehicles, as Mercedes-Benz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385437/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-ev-photos-specs"&gt;just last week revealed what is essentially an all-electric S-Class sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The A6 E-Tron won’t be a pound-for-pound competitor to that offering, just like the gas-powered A6 doesn’t directly compete with the internal combustion S-Class. But the concept version announced Monday is a tease in two senses. One, it gives people a rough idea of what to expect from the ultimate production version of the A6 E-Tron. And two, it’s a first look at what Audi will do with the electric cars it’s building on that PPE platform — the same platform that will almost certainly power electric versions of other high-end A-series sedans.&lt;/p&gt;
