    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems appears to be a recent app update, which replaced the standard tvOS playback UI with HBO’s own (and apparently far less capable) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBClAz"&gt;It just goes to show that a platform holder can build a powerful combination of hardware and software in support of third-party apps and services, but it doesn’t mean anything unless those same apps and services actually bother to add support. We’ve reached out to both Disney Plus and HBO Max to see if they’re aware of the issues, and to find out when users can expect a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A very sus chicken nugget shaped like an Among Us crewmate sells for $99,997 on eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aSSXd7jAizhVH_IYno9waPdUP4=/0x160:1200x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404693/s_l1600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d still eat it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304012821839?_trksid=p2471758.m4704" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UI0t59"&gt;After an intense, dayslong bidding war, a single McDonald’s chicken nugget shaped like one of the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates has just sold for an eye-watering $99,997&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F304012821839%3F_trksid%3Dp2471758.m4703&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPCcV"&gt;The little nugget started off from humble beginnings, listed for a respectable 99 cents on May 28th. (I’d pay that much for it. Maybe even $5.) And for a little while, there were no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumi2C"&gt;But then, two days after it was first listed, somebody placed an (at the time) astonishingly high $14,869.69 first bid on the nugget, and things just escalated from there. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fbfl%2Fviewbids%2F304012821839%3Fitem%3D304012821839%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2565&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22504587%2Famong-us-mcdonalds-chicken-nugget-ebay-auction-bts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;I recommend scrolling through the bid history, it’s wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iCzwn0w4PY89BiGK0HWnIoxIuUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636616/msedge_SOv9UYEFFc.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: eBay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The completed listing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A7d4Js"&gt;One factor that may have driven up the price is that the nugget apparently came from &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/bts-meal.html"&gt;a BTS Meal&lt;/a&gt; — yes, like the huge K-pop group. Maybe BTS Meal nuggets taste better? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neisuW"&gt;Oh, and if you were wondering, should the buyer choose to eat the nugget it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be safe to — the seller said they would freeze and air-seal the nugget and that it would be delivered “prior to expiration.” If I were the buyer, though, I’d use some caution. The seller says that “this food product has an average expiration of about 14 days,” but I am not sure where they’re getting that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciTx3Y"&gt;But if the buyer wants to dip the nugget in some Szechuan sauce? They’ll have to ask for that. “I have Szechuan and at buyers [sic] request will ship some with the nugget,” the seller said. Harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p7Zn"&gt;Let’s just hope the nugget isn’t an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taito announces mini arcade cabinet with rotating screen and trackball controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDH2eMvkcCQXwbrp_ZCGWmtQgNo=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404638/taito1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBZ6Hi"&gt;Taito is the latest Japanese video game publisher to resurrect old hardware in mini form. The company behind &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;, and many more arcade classics has just announced the &lt;a href="https://taito.co.jp/egret2mini"&gt;Egret II Mini&lt;/a&gt;, which like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347909/astro-city-mini-review-sega-arcade-cabinet-us-release-price-games"&gt;Sega’s excellent Astro City Mini&lt;/a&gt; is a shrunken-down version of a popular arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A3OIp"&gt;The original Egret II was released in the ‘90s, and its key feature was the ability to rotate its screen 90 degrees so that games with tall aspect ratios — like &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt; and other shooters — could be played in &lt;em&gt;tate&lt;/em&gt; (vertical) mode. Appropriately enough, that feature is present on the Egret II Mini, which has a 5-inch 4:3 LCD that can be played in either orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohl2w_fEGjI5gjNat_GA-TE5p0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636582/taito1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAVB6"&gt;The Egret II Mini’s primary controls include six primary buttons and an arcade-style microswitched stick that can be adjusted from four to eight directions depending on the game. There’s also an optional expansion controller that includes a paddle input for games like &lt;em&gt;Arkanoid, &lt;/em&gt;as well as a trackball for the likes of &lt;em&gt;Cameltry&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHEHpn"&gt;Here’s what the controller looks like. It’s 240 x 100 x 48mm, so it looks pretty substantial — somewhere between a traditional gamepad and fighting stick in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7kZbanLZlbk_TqLc-GECzfd0H4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636585/taito2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfe9E1"&gt;Taito is also selling a gamepad and an additional arcade stick as optional extras:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW6jUN65tCk0IuvcTE_CvIIi7NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636591/taito3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K3NohM"&gt;There’ll be 40 games preloaded on the cabinet itself, and the expansion controller also includes an SD card with ten games that use the paddle or trackball. Here’s the list of titles that have been confirmed so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mCAPnY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Invaders &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtCl2w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lunar Rescue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m5xEbu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJbgDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elevator Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8DSmdj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chack’n Pop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BatQIx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bubble Bobble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UyvEga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rastan Saga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nDNDQX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Islands Extra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M9MMiO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Zealand Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F163wK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don Doko Don&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y2IM0M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Violence Fight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qUyjDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cadash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NdmMTO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquid Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zgrKF8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hN8Ik"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaiser Knuckle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="BdiX63"&gt;The paddle/trackball games so far confirmed for the bundled SD card include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v021lo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strike Bowling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1mPp5G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arkanoid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wsN1hi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plump Pop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="40rPIQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syvalion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HwkGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameltry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WYKc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arkanoid Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="m5SC1l"&gt;Beyond the SD card slot, the Egret II Mini also has a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports for controllers, an HDMI port for TV output, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVpnMH"&gt;The Egret II Mini could get pretty expensive depending how big of a Taito fan you are. The cabinet itself costs 18,678 yen (~$170), the expansion controller is 12,078 yen ($110), the extra arcade stick is 8,778 yen ($80), and the gamepad is $3,278 yen ($30). There’s also a 49,478-yen ($450) limited bundle that includes everything plus some extras like soundtrack CDs, and a 32,978-yen ($300) bundle that excludes the arcade stick and the gamepad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbaegO"&gt;At least there’s time to save up your yen — the Egret II Mini won’t ship until March 2nd 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iPad Pro has wireless charging and a glass back: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. This review has focused a lot on the 12.9, but other than the screen and size the 11-inch is the same." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD1MZdg_0RBL6JtRDapYh_oyZsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404453/vpavic_210512_4592_0203.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sYmdkN"&gt;Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Pro with wireless charging, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate the technology, Apple will reportedly switch to a glass back for the new models, instead of the aluminum found on the rear of every iPad released so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmfVk"&gt;Apple is said to be testing a magnetic charging system for the new iPad Pro similar to the MagSafe connector introduced with the iPhone 12 range of phones last year. Apple may also include reverse wireless charging in the new iPad Pro, according to the report, which would allow the iPad to serve as a wireless charging point itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nqHYdc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Editor’s Choice: iPad mini 2019","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18564029/ipad-mini-5th-generation-2019-editors-choice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I4b119"&gt;Apple only just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the new M1 iPad Pro with its Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, and the wireless charging model reportedly won’t be ready until next year. However, Bloomberg also says that Apple will release a redesigned iPad Mini in 2021 with narrower screen bezels. It’s not clear whether it’ll switch to Face ID like the iPad Pro or Touch ID on the power button like the iPad Air — Bloomberg’s report only says that “the removal of its home button has also been tested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7jgAh"&gt;Alongside the new iPad Mini, Apple is also said to be planning to release a thinner version of the 10.2-inch iPad. Both products are likely to be released around the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h16lVY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Climate tech is about to fly commercial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlVmHmfQJ0b5DKC-A4UxCxIBcio=/0x0:689x459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69403168/paolo_wilczak_groton_ct_04252020_compressed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hiring private contractors to sample greenhouse gases from the air is an important aspect of NOAA’s climate research. Here, Paolo Wilczak pilots a sampling flight over southeastern Connecticut on April 25, 2020, as part of the East Coast Outflow field mission. The Global Monitoring Laboratory hopes to add civilian airliners to its sampling fleet.&amp;nbsp; | Paolo Wilczak, Scientific Aviation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7IXYA"&gt;A greenhouse gas-tracking technology is about to go commercial. Greenhouse gas detectors will soon take flight on an Alaska Airlines-run Boeing 737-9, in an effort to help federal scientists get even more information about how we’re changing the climate. The tools would measure concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the air, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQyHa"&gt;They’re calling the plane, which won’t have any passengers, an “&lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/principles/environment/ecodemonstrator"&gt;ecoDemonstrator&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s testing a number of contraptions along with the greenhouse-gas detector — including features that might make the plane more fuel-efficient or less noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR1OzA"&gt;Over several test flights this year, NOAA will figure out the best place to install their devices — either mounted on a window or in a duct that feeds outside air into the plane — in order to stay out of the way of the plane’s own exhaust. The goal is to beef up NOAA’s existing data collection efforts by eventually getting the equipment on a number of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;commercial airliners making domestic and international flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oNOGOJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re actually measuring where it counts”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pq3zBk"&gt;A handful of private jets already collect samples for NOAA. An entire fleet of commercial planes adding to the effort could become a powerful tool for tracking where greenhouse gas emissions come from and how much they’re building up in the atmosphere. That knowledge could also help scientists and policymakers measure whether or not humans are making any progress towards tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtvQSX"&gt;“We think we’re making inroads, but are we making inroads? Is the atmosphere actually changing?” says Colm Sweeney, lead scientist for the NOAA Earth System Research Lab Aircraft Program. “Are we looking at the forest or are we just looking at one tree?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prsN3s"&gt;Sweeney and his colleagues plan to focus on carbon dioxide and methane. From the ground, researchers can get pretty good estimates of how much CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels for things like electricity, transportation, and industry. Ground-level data on methane emissions, on the other hand, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;murkier because it typically just leaks&lt;/a&gt; out of oil and gas infrastructure. There have been more efforts lately to measure these things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/12/16460014/nasa-oco-2-satellite-carbon-dioxide-earth-atmosphere-plants-ocean-climate-change"&gt;by satellite&lt;/a&gt;, too. But planes can fly through the air where these greenhouse gases actually build up, making more precise measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEO10q"&gt;“We’re actually measuring where it counts,” Sweeney says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="agDyxh"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! NOAA and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boeing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Boeing&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up on the 2021 ecoDemonstrator program, which will allow NOAA to test out its greenhouse gas sampling system on an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlaskaAir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AlaskaAir&lt;/a&gt; airplane. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TAwmP4thOx"&gt;https://t.co/TAwmP4thOx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6wnAaMaZgM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6wnAaMaZgM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA Research (@NOAAResearch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAAResearch/status/1400457720000516103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmPcaI"&gt;By taking samples of the outside air over the course of the plane’s journey, researchers can potentially triangulate the source of the pollutants that they measure. Not only are they tracing the emissions back to their source, but they’re also seeing how that pollution travels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gr5XDz"&gt;That’s also important for sussing out how changes to the natural world are affecting the climate. Rising temperatures are melting permafrost, releasing even more methane into the atmosphere, pushing temperatures higher in a dangerous feedback loop. NOAA hopes to better understand the extent to which that’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTmkFh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NOAA’s measurements could give some early warnings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYB4pQ"&gt;Scientists are also worried about how much humans can continue to rely on natural resources, like oceans and forests, to draw down and store carbon dioxide emissions. NOAA’s measurements could give some early warnings before these ‘carbon sinks’ reach their limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi3vNi"&gt;Sweeney hopes NOAA’s test runs are successful. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/03/826848818/one-more-coronavirus-problem-accurate-weather-forecasts"&gt;Thousands of commercial planes&lt;/a&gt; are already taking temperature readings used for weather forecasts. So perhaps one day they could all also take stock of the pollution that’s giving the planet a fever in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyVY1e4lie7Y0cfQ7GA2sUgtd7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69402074/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his post after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have initiated internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June 1st, an employee sent a note to the Jewish employee listserv, which has more than 3,000 members, writing that they were  “deeply concerned about antisemitism within our DEI leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mQrG2"&gt;The email read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0qwK"&gt;As the subject indicates, I’m very concerned about antisemitism within our leadership. Our Director of Diversity Strategy and Research appears to have strong opinion about Jews and Israel. I’ll let you all have a look at his blog for yourselves, but here are some quotes that you’ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a96bB5"&gt;“If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGvquI"&gt;“The ability of the United States and Israel to not only dictate the terms of my subjugation but characterize my desire to be free as rooted in hatred would burn my intellect and my sensibility as a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5IU6q"&gt;“Looming large, like a grand dark cloud of human atrocity, is the slaughter of Palestinians by unrepentant Israeli Jews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2bCdz"&gt;Does anyone else think this is totally inappropriate for someone in this kind of position? I’m scared that someone at this level has these kinds of feelings about Jews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lMoJ7s"&gt;The thread spiraled, garnering roughly 80 responses, with multiple calls for Bobb to be fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqJFa9"&gt;More moderate members of the group felt that while the blog post sounded problematic, the underlying sentiment resonated. “The language of this letter is very hurtful and antisemitic,” says a current employee who asked to remain anonymous. “That said, digging up an old blog from over a decade ago feels like a witch hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmW87X"&gt;Later that evening, Bobb sent an email to the Jewish employee resource group, apologizing for what he had said. “What I wrote crudely characterized the entire jewish community,” he wrote. “What was intended as a critique of particular military action fed into antisemitic tropes and prejudice. I think we can all agree, there is no easy solution to this situation. But that’s beside the point. The way I expressed my views on that conflict were hurtful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xwTd1"&gt;Now, Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Bobb is no longer a member of the diversity team, though he remains at the company. “We unequivocally condemn the past writings by a member of our diversity team that are causing deep offense and pain to members of our Jewish community and our LGBTQ+ community,” wrote a Google spokesperson in a statement. “These writings are unquestionably hurtful. The author acknowledges this and has apologized. He will no longer be part of our diversity team going forward and will focus on his STEM work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKDsAt"&gt;Google did not respond to further questions about what focusing on “STEM work” means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqOie8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3CSss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2aI4Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giR0Va"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to end special treatment for politicians after Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8ob2M-0BqMSQNF9E8FC2boLdsc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69402015/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SY6tpr"&gt;Facebook plans to end its controversial policy that mostly shields politicians from the content moderation rules that apply to other users, a sharp reversal that could have global ramifications for how elected officials use the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1TpWJ"&gt;The change, which Facebook is set to announce as soon as Friday, comes after the Oversight Board — an independent group funded by Facebook to review its thorniest content rulings — affirmed its decision to suspend former President Donald Trump but critiqued the special treatment it gives politicians, stating that the “same rules should apply to all users.” The board gave Facebook till June 5th to respond to its policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEIsJb"&gt;Facebook also plans to shed light on the secretive system of strikes it gives accounts for breaking its content rules, according to two people familiar with the changes. That will include letting users know when they’ve received a strike for violating its rules that could lead to suspension. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-zuckerberg-what-if-trump-disputes-election-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other outlets have previously reported on instances when Facebook employees intervened to keep political pages from being subject to harsh penalties under the strikes policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xaGY0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg previously said Facebook shouldn’t police speech by politicians&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfhdBa"&gt;Facebook is also set to begin disclosing when it uses a special newsworthiness exemption to keep up content from politicians and others that would otherwise violate its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YPwNk"&gt;A spokesperson for Facebook had no comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqDjrz"&gt;The changes are notable for Facebook since it historically has taken a hands-off approach to what elected officials say on its service. Company executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have said that they shouldn’t be in the business of policing speech by politicians. They’ve argued that such speech is already the most scrutinized in the world, and that private companies shouldn’t censor what politicians say to their citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzz9Vc"&gt;For the past few years, Facebook has maintained a list of political accounts that aren’t subject to the same fact-checking or content moderation processes that apply to other users. In 2019, a group of employees asked for the list to be dissolved, citing internal research that showed people were especially likely to believe falsehoods if they were shared by an elected official, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-researchers-found-companys-political-whitelist-influenced-misinformation-spread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwrnsK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The policy faced blowback over Trump and violent comments in India&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXdVGF"&gt;That same year, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, clarified the policy publicly, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; “we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.” Beyond expressly illegal content such as child pornography, Facebook would only take action against comments by politicians if they could credibly lead to physical harm or discourage voting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buOF9z"&gt;Content from other sources that politicians share, such as news links or videos, has already been subject to fact-checking, a step that can greatly reduce the distribution of posts. Under Facebook’s new policies, posts made directly by politicians still won’t be subject to review by the company’s network of independent fact checkers. But they will for the first time be opened up to enforcement against more rules for things like bullying that Facebook’s moderators apply to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QjtxY"&gt;The hands-off policy for political speech faced intense blowback when Trump used Facebook to stoke division after the murder of George Floyd and later praised his supporters as they attempted a violent insurrection at the US Capitol in January. And in India, Facebook’s largest country by users, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; for not taking action against violent comments made by members of the ruling party. Under the new policy for politicians, Facebook could still use its newsworthiness exemption to leave up a post that would otherwise be taken down. But it will commit to disclosing when it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R86MLh"&gt;After the January attack on the Capitol by Trump’s followers, Facebook indefinitely blocked his ability to post and referred the decision to the Oversight Board, a group of human rights experts it set up to make judgements on its policy enforcement. The board responded saying that Facebook was wrong to take special action on Trump’s account, since its public policies don’t explain when it can indefinitely block someone’s ability to post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uteAZK"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/226612455899839-oversight-board-upholds-former-president-trump-s-suspension-finds-facebook-failed-to-impose-proper-penalty/"&gt;written response&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook on May 5th, the board called on the company to “address widespread confusion about how decisions relating to influential users are made.” Facebook was given 30 days to respond to the board’s recommendations and six months to complete its review of Trump’s account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QOSWYvghxFn8weHchD7bXIkdAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401765/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more privacy-conscious for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B1up2"&gt;Before the update, if AirTags were away from their owner, they would chime &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airtag-privacy-loopholes"&gt;after three days&lt;/a&gt; if they detected that they were moving. If you had a fully up-to-date iPhone, you might get an “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;AirTag Found Moving With You&lt;/a&gt;” notification &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;before then&lt;/a&gt; — but un-updated iPhone users and Android users were out of luck until that chime. Apple is now updating the AirTags to chime at some point between eight and 24 hours of separation, significantly reducing how long an AirTag can travel before telling on itself. (Apple didn’t respond to request for comment on the range of times it provided.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQlugy"&gt;Apple says the Android app will be coming “later this year” and will be able to detect both AirTags and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My network accessories&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFtfZW"&gt;Eight to 24 hours is still a long time to be tracked without knowing, but it’s good to see that Apple is at least starting to address some of people’s concerns. The update is out today and should happen automatically when an AirTag comes into proximity with an iPhone similar to how AirPods silently receive updates, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xomul"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden signs order banning US investment in Chinese surveillance companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tulsa Commemorates 100th Anniversary Of Tulsa Race Massacre" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brN_nq9eTc6qszICVkIvUfVr7Gg=/0x0:6192x4128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401672/1321197115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCTXS2"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; Thursday expanding a Trump-era ban on Americans investing in Chinese companies with purported ties to China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuZtJK"&gt;The order increases the number of restricted Chinese companies from 48 to 59. It also rewrites &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/11/12/trump-bans-americans-from-investing-in-companies-that-support-chinas-military/"&gt;a previous order issued&lt;/a&gt; by former President Donald Trump to include companies that create and deploy surveillance technology, like the technology used against Muslim minorities and dissidents in Hong Kong. The move signals that Biden plans to continue some of the same China-related policies previously put in place by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTLXar"&gt;The order does not include DJI, WeChat, TikTok, or its parent company ByteDance among the 59 companies, despite previous concerns about those companies’ ties to China. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order"&gt;Trump signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to ban Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat from US app stores, but Thursday’s order is separate from Trump’s move to ban these apps. In February, the Biden administration asked &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/11/wechat-trump-biden-pause/"&gt;a federal appeals court&lt;/a&gt; to place a hold on any legal proceedings regarding these app bans. It’s still unclear how Biden plans to address the TikTok ban going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IxXCqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blzXRh"&gt;“We fully expect that in the months ahead ... we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” a White House official told &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-order-ban-investment-59-173000498.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yahoo News &lt;/em&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1t9h3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the move is part of the Biden administration’s commitments refusing to facilitate human rights abuses in China. For years, the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html"&gt;has used a confluence&lt;/a&gt; of facial recognition technology, phone scanners, and artificial intelligence as part of a sweeping surveillance push to empower China’s police force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfW1SE"&gt;The order bans Americans from investing in these additional Chinese firms starting on August 2nd. This extends to Americans investing in funds that then invest in Chinese firms as well. The order allows current investors in these companies to divest their holdings over a one-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q58fi"&gt;Under this new order, the Treasury Department will be in charge of the list of banned companies. The Trump administration had previously put the authority on the Defense Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiE7Rd"&gt;The federal government has been pushing for broader action against Chinese tech and telecom companies for years. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission designated telecom companies Huawei and ZTE &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;as threats to national security&lt;/a&gt;. Surveillance technology is sometimes sold as part of a package deal when nations abroad purchase Huawei equipment, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Last September, the FCC estimated that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” equipment from these firms that is already embedded in US networks; Congress has yet to allocate any such funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wy2Ft5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2CgxnC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1082915/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNewOffer060321"&gt;Paramount Plus &lt;/a&gt;is set to introduce a new ad-supported plan on Monday that will cost just $5 per month — half the price of its more premium plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfpmOJ"&gt;The primary difference between what the service is calling its “essential” plan and the more expensive commercial-free plan — besides the addition of ads — is some missing content. The $10 commercial-free plan includes both local and national news coverage with CBSN and CBS live, whereas the new essential plan only includes national news with CBSN. There’s more sports coverage on the commercial-free plan as well, and premium users also get support for offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8WQQg"&gt;Both plans include access to tens of thousands of TV episodes and movies, as well as the platform’s originals, but premium tier subscribers will only see ads on live TV programming and a handful of series. Of note, the new budget plan — which will replace an existing limited-commercial tier — will not include a user’s local live CBS channel that’s also included in the limited-commercial experience, a spokesperson for the service confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W2w9a1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new $5 plan will replace an older $6 tier carried over from CBS All Access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjYa8i"&gt;As was announced when the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315338/paramount-plus-hands-on-nickleodeon-mtv-streaming-tv-movies"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; in March, the new tier will replace an older $6 option that was carried over when the service rebranded from CBS All Access. The commercial-free plan normally costs $10 per month, but the company offered a limited commercial programming option for $6 per month. Though those who are currently on the $6 plan can remain on that tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyz3AV"&gt;If you’re a current subscriber to an existing $6 plan grandfathered in from CBS All Access, you may want to stay on the slightly more expensive plan you’re currently on — at least if local news coverage is important to you. Additionally, if a limited-commercial subscriber opts into the new $5 plan, they will not be able to switch their plan back to the $6 tier after June 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRZQfF"&gt;In other words, if you’ve been considering a Paramount Plus subscription and would like local news coverage included in your ad-supported experience, now’s the time to subscribe. If limited advertising is less important to you than shaving a buck off your streaming tab every month, then keep an eye out for the new plan come launch day on June 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
