    <title>Fortnite’s Naruto collab includes more than just skins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K76CmP4KTW92r7UA0rFqGJqQT04=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148104/18BR_Naruto_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characters from &lt;/em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;em&gt; are joining &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRrwuk"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1458555063534854145"&gt;a tease last week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s highly anticipated collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/naruto-x-fortnite-is-finally-here"&gt;is finally here&lt;/a&gt;. Starting Tuesday, you’ll be able to play as characters from the hugely popular anime series &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; in Epic Games’ hit battle royale. There will be four &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; characters that are now available in the in-game item shop — Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake — as well as a &lt;em&gt;Naruto &lt;/em&gt;glider, two emotes, and two loading screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcDdV5"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just getting &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; skins. A throwable paper bomb kunai is being added as a weapon to the game. You’ll be able to meet Kakashi Hatake as an NPC on the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island and get quests from him. And there will be an entire &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt;-themed Creative map you can explore based on the Hidden Leaf Village from the anime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QaRbKufooKLwTOeOy6zQYiK4Slk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007349/18BR_Naruto_ShinobiTeamworkLoadingScreen.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll soon see &lt;/em&gt;Naruto&lt;em&gt; characters hopping off the battle bus.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MhifVo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; takeover is the latest of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s many extensive collaborations with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;other huge entertainment properties&lt;/a&gt;. Previous hits included the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/14/21020296/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-fortnite-jj-abrams-lightsabers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; lightsabers as a weapon&lt;/a&gt; and an entire season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;dedicated to Marvel characters and locations&lt;/a&gt;. While the current season isn’t tied to any existing brand — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;instead, it’s full of cubes&lt;/a&gt; — the introduction of &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; characters brings some anime ninja action to the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Balmuda Phone is a compact Android phone from a high-end toaster company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKeX3hdAWiaNxxPC4GogvZITY8w=/0x0:3339x2226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148021/7ABABA5A_D83B_498D_9F33_08E0C80D8CE5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pt1nF"&gt;Japanese design company Balmuda today announced its first smartphone at a press event in Tokyo. The straightforwardly titled Balmuda Phone is the debut product from Balmuda Technologies, a new division of the company previously known for stylish, premium home appliances like air purifiers and rice cookers. Balmuda’s toaster in particular has a cult following in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEM2i"&gt;As you’d expect, the Balmuda Phone is quite a bit different to other phones on the market. CEO Gen Terao said on stage that he felt that smartphones have gotten too big and unwieldy in recent years, so the Balmuda Phone was designed with compactness and elegance as the primary goals. It has a very sharp 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display and is roughly comparable to a 4.7-inch iPhone SE; the display is slightly bigger and the phone is 2mm wider, but the smaller bezels mean it’s 15mm shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN__psLPI6HAZ0JLLqx4FcYmkaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018299/913677DF_0F3E_4043_89E8_3AEDC7B09DF4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone is much thicker in the middle than on the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0QexY"&gt;The Balmuda Phone is a full 13.7mm thick at its thickest point, but the back panel tapers down heavily toward the edges. There’s a single large camera with a 48-megapixel sensor in the top right corner, and a similar-looking cutout in the top left houses a fingerprint sensor. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is housed in a hole-punch cutout at the top right of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XHTgf"&gt;The phone’s specs are generally mid-range. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 and there’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is just 2,500mAh, which will hopefully be offset somewhat by the lower-power processor, though we’ll have to test for ourselves to see. The phone does thankfully have wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arA421"&gt;Where Balmuda is really differentiating itself is with design. It’s a well-worn tech writing cliche to say that something “feels good in the hand,” but that was clearly Balmuda’s intent here with the compact size and curved back that nestles into your palm like a pebble. I have big hands, granted, but I think just about anyone would find this more comfortable to use than the hefty 6-inch slabs most of us carry around these days. While the case is plastic, build quality feels solid and there’s a nice contrast between the textured back panel and the glossy edges. All in all it’s a cute, attractive object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rl_ANrYzkkReSjuhmQ1rPu8ur0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018298/1C8A4701_958F_4569_B34D_2A9B396E407A.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a textured plastic back and comes in black or white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QdLYwVGs4Ir1fsShFoeNDs55Ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018304/IMG_0777.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Balmuda’s built-in calendar app, which syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNb9Ee"&gt;The software, based on Android 11, is also very different to what you’d find on most Android phones today. There’s an interactive home screen with various elements of the wallpaper customizable for different shortcuts; for example, you could swipe on one of the lines to launch Google Maps. Horizontal swipes move you between some of the built-in software, like a calendar, a notes app, and a calculator. All of these had neat design touches, like the notes app’s visual timeline of photos and memos, or the calculator app’s built-in currency conversion and ability to handle large Japanese numbers that are counted in the 10,000s rather than the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEkgcb"&gt;The Balmuda Phone will be available in Japan on contract with SoftBank later this month, and Balmuda is selling an unlocked model itself for 104,800 yen (about $920). That might sound like a lot for a compact Android 11 phone with these specs, but then $329 probably sounds like a lot for a toaster, too. In both cases, you’re paying for the design and the user experience rather than the bill of materials, and this clearly isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a conventional Android flagship. As someone who does own Balmuda’s toaster, I’m looking forward to finding out how well the phone holds up under general use — because much as I like the toaster, a smartphone is a lot more important to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JPMorgan says Tesla owes the bank $162 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRd3uJAKHapevvd14e-KOI3f_AY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147363/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKoeUc"&gt;JPMorgan has sued Tesla, claiming that the electric car company owes the bank $162 million related to a 2014 stock warrant agreement. The dispute centers around adjustments the companies made to the agreement following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 “[f]unding secured” tweet and the resulting fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO2MqN"&gt;The lawsuit was filed late Monday &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891.1.0.pdf"&gt;in the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUbC4a"&gt;According to the suit, which was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jpmorgan-sues-tesla-162-mln-related-warrants-2021-11-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, JPMorgan purchased a number of warrants from Tesla in 2014 — back when the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/tesla-raises-2-billion-with-convertible-debt-to-finance-factory"&gt;was still trying to fund the construction of the original Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmXzLm"&gt;Stock warrants give the buyer (JPMorgan, in this case) a right to purchase shares in a company (Tesla) at a set price within a certain window of time. The warrants JPMorgan bought from Tesla in 2014 were set to expire in June and July of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2x4a"&gt;Initially, the companies agreed to a “strike price” of $560.6388. If the warrants expired and Tesla’s stock price was less than that strike price, neither company would owe the other anything. But if Tesla’s stock price was above the strike price at expiration, JPMorgan says Musk’s company was basically supposed to hand over stock equal to the difference in those prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xt0HaJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;JPMorgan could change the price of the warrants if Tesla announced a merger or acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DIy5Qd"&gt;Being a massive, complicated financial transaction, JPMorgan made sure there were all sorts of legal protections in place. One was a hedge against any big announcements related to mergers or buyouts that could affect Tesla’s stock price. If something like that were to come along, the bank and the automaker were able to agree on a new strike price for the warrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJFqKc"&gt;Which brings us to the tweet. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering"&gt;famously tweeted on August 7th, 2018&lt;/a&gt; that he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Later that day, Tesla’s chief financial officer, its head of communications, and its chief lawyer wrote an email attributed to Musk that was published on Tesla’s blog explaining his announcement. Musk also tweeted that “[i]nvestor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Tesla’s investor relations head also told some press that there was a “firm offer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3tkLk"&gt;Basically none of that was true, though, as everyone found out after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk and Tesla&lt;/a&gt; over the announcement. Musk had a cursory conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, but that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaEnO"&gt;Before that truth came out, though, JPMorgan saw the resulting volatility in Tesla’s stock price and decided to amend the strike price of its warrants. It lowered the price to $424.66 and notified Tesla. Tesla agreed to a conference call scheduled for August 24th, but backed out at the last minute, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5mcLY"&gt;That same day, Tesla and Musk announced that they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17780714/elon-musk-tesla-staying-public"&gt;abandoning the attempt to take Tesla private&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDxBkA"&gt;So JPMorgan once again decided to adjust the strike price of the warrants. It made new calculations based on the response to the decision by Tesla and Musk to do an about-face, and settled on a strike price of $484.35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gKx0Dd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla allegedly ghosted JPMorgan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0pBCt"&gt;This time, Tesla “protested that no adjustment should be necessary at all because it had so quickly abandoned its going-private plans,” JPMorgan writes in its lawsuit. The bank gave Tesla its calculations and “held several conference calls” to explain them, and says Tesla “did not provide any specific objection” to those explanations. After that, JPMorgan says Tesla stopped talking to the bank for six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dc4PB"&gt;Tesla’s lawyers eventually sent a letter to JPMorgan in February 2019 claiming that the bank’s adjustments were “unreasonably swift and represented an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in Tesla’s stock.” JPMorgan wrote back, “rejecting all of [Tesla’s] allegations,” but then the two sides didn’t talk for two years. JPMorgan made another adjustment down to $96.87 in August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364073/tesla-five-way-stock-split-august-21-plan-approved-shares-accessible-cheaper"&gt;account for Tesla’s stock split&lt;/a&gt;, and says Tesla never responded to that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sLc0"&gt;By the time the expiration dates came around this year, Tesla’s stock was already on an incredible run and JPMorgan’s warrants were “‘in the money’ by a substantial amount,” according to the suit. When the bank contacted Tesla to cash out, Tesla “renewed its objections to the Adjustments.” Tesla did settle some shares with JPMorgan — the bank did not say how many — but “refused to settle in full,” the bank claims, so it triggered an “early termination” clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYF74U"&gt;JPMorgan says Tesla still owed 228,775 shares when it terminated the deal, and that those shares are worth $162,216,628.81 based on Tesla’s stock price at the time. (Potentially worse for JPMorgan, it had hedged its warrant agreement with Tesla by maintaining a short position against Tesla’s stock. When Tesla didn’t settle the remaining shares, the bank had to buy the same amount on the open market to cover that hedged bet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu6UZE"&gt;Shortly after the suit was filed on Monday, Musk was still actively tweeting in a thread he started Sunday in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/tesla-ceo-elon-musks-twitter-fight-with-bernie-sanders-on-tax-policy.html"&gt;response to a Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) tweet&lt;/a&gt; about taxes. “I like to dig my grave real deep,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1460411507066425351"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IATSE members vote to ratify contracts that include better streaming pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) members and Entertainment Industry Workers Supporters held a press conference in Hollywood" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkX0_YLbVmrEnYbYZ7MHVC7TleM=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147195/1236517234.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNMnqt"&gt;A major Hollywood union has voted to ratify a pair of contracts to improve labor conditions for production workers — though narrowly — after previously voting to authorize a strike over stalled negotiations with major studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Evis"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/iatse-members-ratify-contracts-with-producers-studios-and-streaming-services/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; its members narrowly voted to ratify both the Basic Agreement and the Area Standards Agreement, three-year contracts that included provisions for things like meal times and breaks, increased base pay for the union’s lowest-paid members, and better terms for productions from streaming services. Both votes were extraordinarily close, and the vote around the Basic Agreement, in particular, is contentious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJLX7d"&gt;IATSE uses an electoral college-like voting system (delegates are assigned to IATSE’s local unions based on their number of members). Delegate votes leaned yes for both contracts, and 52 percent of members voted in favor of the Area Standards Agreement (48 percent voted no). But the popular vote for the Basic Agreement shook out to 50.4 percent no to 49.6 percent yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MbKND"&gt;The union said that 72 percent of its 63,209 members, or 45,402 members total, participated in the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSg6rM"&gt;“Our goal was to achieve fair contracts that work for IATSE members in television and film—that address quality-of-life issues and conditions on the job like rest and meal breaks,” IATSE international president Matthew Loeb said in a statement. “We met our objectives for this round of bargaining and built a strong foundation for future agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9LGJ3"&gt;It was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749253/hollywood-union-itsea-amptp-vote-streaming-pay"&gt;high-stakes vote&lt;/a&gt; for the union, which previously voted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;authorize a strike&lt;/a&gt; when negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) — which represents studios like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Disney, among others — came to a standstill. That strike was narrowly avoided in October after the parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;reached agreements&lt;/a&gt; just days before the strike was scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl1kU0"&gt;“From start to finish, from preparation to ratification, this has been a democratic process to win the very best contracts,” Loeb said. “The vigorous debate, high turnout, and close election, indicates we have an unprecedented movement-building opportunity to educate members on our collective bargaining process and drive more participation in our union long-term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxIhwh"&gt;While streaming was a small part of a much larger push for better labor protections for production workers, the negotiations highlighted how rapidly the industry has evolved amid the streaming wars. The union argued that streamers were underpaying for production work, and part of the contract terms include provisions for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735892/iatses-tentative-basic-agreement-streaming-pay"&gt;higher rates&lt;/a&gt; primarily based on the type of content being created.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton’s on-demand classes and leaderboard are at the heart of both lawsuits.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdlGa6"&gt;Peloton isn’t too happy with its rivals. The company has filed lawsuits against Echelon and iFit, claiming each company violated patents related to Peloton’s on-demand classes, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/peloton-sues-ifit-echelon-over-new-patent-for-on-demand-classes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aI2w24"&gt;The issue at hand is that Peloton says Echelon and iFit are gaining “free rides” from its technology. In court documents, the company specifically pointed to its leaderboards and the ability to participate in live classes with other users. In its case against iFit, Peloton says that before it came along, iFit “only allowed subscribers to follow along with pre-recorded exercise classes on their machines, without any sort of community engagement.” It also takes issue with iFit’s ActivePulse and SmartAdjust features, which automatically adjust things like workout speeds based on a specific class. Peloton introduced a similar feature on its Bike Plus called auto-follow, which adjusts the bike’s resistance during a workout without requiring you to fiddle with the resistance knob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzeKfz"&gt;Peloton claims that dozens of iFit and Echelon products have profited off Peloton’s technology. That includes stationary bikes, treadmills, rowers, and ellipticals sold under the NordicTrack, ProForm, and FreeMotion brands. In particular, Peloton called out the NordicTrack S22i Studio Cycle Bike (which, to be fair, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pretty similar to the Bike Plus). As for Echelon, it called out the company’s connected bikes, rowers, and treadmills — all of which offer similar features but for significantly less. During the pandemic, Echelons wares were often referred to as “Peloton alternatives” by &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-peloton-alternatives"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/health/features/echelon-review-cheaper-spin-bike-good-peloton"&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/i-tried-echelons-1000-alternative-to-the-peloton-bike-heres-what-happened/"&gt;tech sites&lt;/a&gt;. Echelon also claimed to have developed a $500 Prime Bike for Amazon, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452145/amazon-prime-bike-500-disavow-echelon-fitness-peleton-competitor"&gt;Amazon later denied the partnership&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddR562"&gt;As for what Peloton ultimately wants, the company is asking for a court order that would prevent iFit and Echelon from infringing on its patents, as well as compensation. If granted, that could have a massive impact on the connected fitness space. Most, if not all, modern connected fitness hardware involves some form of on-demand classes and leaderboards. Similar gadgets, like Mirror, Tonal, the SoulCycle Bike, Hydrow, and dozens of other lesser-known brands have popped up in Peloton’s wake. Meanwhile, Apple launched its own Peloton competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; late last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The soundtrack for Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop hits streaming platforms on November 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwXHTBo0aQjhgOdc-MGU2fB3-z0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146898/PF1_0438_2021111193852486.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e10FEI"&gt;The early reaction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22778708/cowboy-bebop-review-season-1-netflix-2021"&gt;has been mixed&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s one thing that everyone seems to agree on: the soundtrack is killer. Yoko Kanno, who gave the original anime its distinctive jazzy songs, returned as composer on the Netflix series, while her band the Seatbelts performed the tracks. The soundtrack includes a few original songs along with rerecorded classics. Thankfully, it’ll also be available to listen to outside of the show very soon. Netflix revealed that the soundtrack will be on streaming services — that includes Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Amazon, and Tidal — starting November 19th, the same day the 10-episode series lands on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo moves to Walmart’s hometown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SprTpqEv5dazmu3Gsq_ACXaP5q0=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146864/Canoo_MPDV_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UB11xx"&gt;EV startup Canoo is &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/70/canoo-inc-announces-third-quarter-2021-results"&gt;moving its headquarters&lt;/a&gt; from California to Walmart’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas — though it didn’t announce any deal with the retail giant. Canoo said it will open a new manufacturing facility in Bentonville but didn’t say much about what will be done there or who will build it. The startup also said Monday that it is moving up its timeline for making its first electric vehicles to “before Q4 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eq5HW"&gt;Canoo CEO Tony Aquila said it will use the Arkansas facility to make “vehicles for unique use cases” and accelerate its pre-production testing program. It still plans to build a factory outside Tulsa, Oklahoma, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar"&gt;announced in June&lt;/a&gt;. Moving forward, Canoo said it will have parts of its R&amp;amp;D, software development, customer support, and finance teams in Oklahoma, and will place more R&amp;amp;D employees in Arkansas along with the new facility. It will keep engineering and vehicle design employees in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVrcBr"&gt;Monday’s announcement is just the latest chapter in the recent remaking of Canoo, which started when Aquila took over as executive chairman in late 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;ahead of its stock exchange debut&lt;/a&gt;. Aquila has since refocused the company on making electric vehicles for small businesses, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;shed a deal with Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, signed a contract manufacturer, and opened up new offices across the sun belt (including in Dallas, Texas). He has also grown the startup to around 800 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4Hjwx"&gt;Founded in 2017, Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;originally called Evelozcity&lt;/a&gt;. It was started by a handful of executives and employees who left fellow EV startup Faraday Future, which was dealing with a severe cash crunch at the time. Canoo was initially focused on creating an electric van that it planned to sell on a subscription model, and at one point &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;was in talks with Apple regarding an acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBDNVj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We took a bit of a punch in the face”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgYVPm"&gt;Canoo said Monday that it lost $81 million in the third quarter of 2021, and has $414 million in the bank. It expects to spend between $95 million and $115 million on operating expenses in the final quarter. Additionally, an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ongoing, the company shared in a stock exchange filing. “We are providing the requested information and cooperating fully with the SEC investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNSAax"&gt;Aquila said on a conference call that Canoo is going to be able to make its electric vehicles earlier than expected despite deciding to “reprioritize” its relationship with the contract manufacturer it signed on, VDL Nedcar. Inflation, shipping, and tax issues in Europe (and VDL’s home country, the Netherlands) made Canoo decide to refocus on making its first vehicles in the US, Aquila said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9mYzi"&gt;“We took a bit of a punch in the face,” Aquila said about announcing that VDL Nedcar would build the first Canoo vehicles. “We did that because that was the right thing for us to do and relay to the market while we were working out and mitigating risk and finding our state partners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqWoM2"&gt;VDL Nedcar was also hit by a cyber attack in October. Canoo said Monday in the stock exchange filing that it has “not yet been able to determine if the proprietary information and intellectual property we have shared with VDL Nedcar in anticipation of entering into definitive agreements, was accessed, compromised or misappropriated in the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jAkGx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2q9mJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $219 or in white for $250. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13e6oH"&gt;For big discounts on the best sound quality from Apple’s AirPods line, the AirPods Max can be bought from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon in space gray or sky blue colorways for just $440&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a hefty $109 off on two sleek colors of Apple’s top-end headphones. It may not be the all-time low price for the AirPods Max, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. Be sure to add either of the two colors to your cart and see the extra savings of $39 reflected at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SnzpqH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXKZ1c"&gt;The hottest new racing game for Xbox consoles, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5, &lt;/em&gt;is currently on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forza-Horizon-Standard-Xbox-One-X/dp/B097MGZ7MY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $51&lt;/a&gt;. This is the latest installment in the Forza franchise and the newest sequel to the open-world racing spinoff. The current deal is for the physical copy on Xbox consoles. It’s also available digitally through Xbox Game Pass on both Xbox and PC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pMfRVE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Amazon is currently offering some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=26&amp;amp;imprToken=c2be8a99-20b2-dfab-0c4&amp;amp;showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22541018%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $210 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;

&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfEpiMWAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding other perks in addition to the six-month subscription to HBO Max. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of other products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is currently selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZr7KF"&gt;Sony’s ZV-1 point-and-shoot camera is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1566753-REG%2Fsony_sony_zv_1_digital_camera.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $746&lt;/a&gt; with a vlogger accessory kit at B&amp;amp;H, a savings of $150. The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which affords you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="xgjs1u"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since.

Target will also be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGsRxP"&gt;Probably the best deal Target has going for it right now is its &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CcA5Vj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is also currently selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $200. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1141873/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6bMV4g"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-viper-8-khz-ambidextrous-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-8000-hz-polling-rate%2F-%2FA-82718043&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ey6aVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhp-15-6-34-laptop-with-windows-home-in-s-mode-intel-core-i3-11th-gen-processor-8gb-ram-memory-256gb-ssd-storage-silver-15-dy2035tg%2F-%2FA-82457999&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Target for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the Beats Solo 3 deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue superstore recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;Below, we’ve collected a handful of deals that piqued our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voices censored words like “gay” and “lesbian”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9GUSXSKf29drpIixxZKi3206z4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146807/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="caAqlz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109"&gt;TikTokers have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voice&lt;/a&gt;, meant to sound like Rocket the Raccoon, would refuse to read words like “gay,” “lesbian,” or “queer” out loud. This decision seems to have been reverted — you can now get the voice to read out those words, but it’s unclear why it was happening. The change, however, is very recent — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that the voice wouldn’t say the words, but it started to do so in a subsequent test minutes later on Monday afternoon. TikTok hasn’t commented on why this happened, but videos posted to highlight the issue still have the words blanked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIsBxe"&gt;Rocket’s voice was introduced to TikTok’s text-to-speech feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;as part of a Disney Plus Day promotion&lt;/a&gt; last week. Other voices, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigweenie1937/video/7029920535513451782"&gt;C-3PO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@caprhicorn/video/7030083950949289222"&gt;Stitch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Lilo and Stitch&lt;/em&gt;, are also supposed to be part of the promotion, but unlike Rocket’s voice they have to be unlocked by using secret phrases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chHNzk"&gt;Prior to the change, Rocket’s voice would skip over the words mentioned above (but seemed to have no issue with words like “transgender” or “bisexual”), though you could easily get the character to say it with phonetically similar misspellings like “qweer.” Trying to make it read text that only contained one of the banned words would result in an error saying that text-to-speech wasn’t supported for the language. TikTok’s own built-in, non-Disney voices would read the word “gay” just fine, either by itself or in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AnkuUE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109" data-video-id="7030602779139919109" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@kbwild_" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_"&gt;@kbwild_&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending is my favorite part &lt;a title="disneyplusday" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disneyplusday"&gt;#disneyplusday&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="disneytexttospeech" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disneytexttospeech"&gt;#disneytexttospeech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="rocket" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rocket"&gt;#rocket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="rockettexttospeech" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rockettexttospeech"&gt;#rockettexttospeech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="disneyvoice" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disneyvoice"&gt;#disneyvoice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lesbian" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lesbian"&gt;#lesbian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lesbianstereotypes" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lesbianstereotypes"&gt;#lesbianstereotypes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="ledollarbean" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ledollarbean"&gt;#ledollarbean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gaytiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gaytiktok"&gt;#gaytiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lesbiantiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lesbiantiktok"&gt;#lesbiantiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lgbtcreators" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lgbtcreators"&gt;#lgbtcreators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="queertiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/queertiktok"&gt;#queertiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="alphabetmafia " target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/alphabetmafia%F0%9F%8C%88"&gt;#alphabetmafia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - KaraBiner (Kbwild)" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7030602558657858310"&gt;♬ original sound - KaraBiner (Kbwild)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77eXy4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok making the rounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; shows what would happen before the change — Rocket wouldn’t say words like “gay” or “queer,” but would say “homophobic.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Flp2LWolhM3APHvtgwYvZOBUuTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017306/IMG_1134.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trying to select Rocket to read the word “gay” would result in an error message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LyXeIo"&gt;Disney has never had a great track record when it comes to LGBTQ representation — many of its iconic villains &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsWpUSEKSbk"&gt;have historically been queer-coded&lt;/a&gt; (something you couldn’t say using Rocket’s voice), and its more recent efforts at representation have been &lt;a href="https://collider.com/why-disney-queer-representation-is-failing/"&gt;limited to single scenes or lines&lt;/a&gt; that are easy to edit out. TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519433/tiktok-intersex-ban-mistake-moderation-transparency"&gt;also has a history&lt;/a&gt; of repeatedly breaking the intersex tag that activists used for activism and education, which the company claimed was a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ORBsz"&gt;Still, outright censoring words about queer identities seems like a stronger step than either company would usually take in 2021. It’s unclear what led them to do so in the first place, and why the decision was reversed. Neither Disney nor TikTok immediately responded to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CvBXKI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither company has explained why this decision was made or reversed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqnn0l"&gt;It’s always possible that this was implemented for well-meaning, if not misguided purposes — bullies have long used both gay and lesbian in an attempt to insult people who don’t identify as such. However, it’s hard to imagine a more effective bullying tactic than literally preventing queer people from talking about their identities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSCntX"&gt;While it’s understandable that Disney wouldn’t want its characters’ voices reading things that aren’t family-friendly like serious swears or slurs (though it’s worth noting that Rocket tosses out phrases like “jackass” and “douchebag” in &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;), we’re well past the point where labeling LGBTQ+ people’s identities as antithetical to family values is acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33BHmk"&gt;It should go without saying that many families include queer people, including ones that are children in Disney’s target demographic, who may want to use TikTok’s text-to-speech feature to talk about their lives and experiences. While it’s good that this decision appears to have been reversed (though it’s unclear why or by whom), it’s one that shouldn’t have been made in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon fined $500,000 for failing to notify California workers about COVID-19 cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8SfArYOQM-pLqj-qDlm452oyqM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146805/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRSHea"&gt;Amazon has been ordered to pay a fine of $500,000 for hiding the number of COVID-19 cases at its California workplaces from employees. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/amazon-covid-outbreak-workplace-safety-right-to-know-penalty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company agreed to pay the fine and improve the way it tracks cases and notifies workers and local health agencies. Amazon must also inform its warehouse workers in California of the “exact number of new COVID-19 cases in their workplaces” when cases arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7RPpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first fine related to California’s COVID “right to know” legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp6vUg"&gt;California attorney general Rob Bonta said in a &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/nationwide-first-attorney-general-bonta-secures-judgment-requiring-amazon-comply"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that the penalty comes after a complaint filed against Amazon alleged that the company didn’t properly notify warehouse workers and local health agencies about new COVID-19 cases “often leaving them in the dark and unable to effectively track the spread of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jp3o8"&gt;This is the first fine related to &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB685"&gt;California’s COVID “right to know” (AB 685) legislation&lt;/a&gt;, which was passed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; reported. Under the law, employers are required to alert workers who were potentially exposed to COVID-19 within one day, and must also report COVID-19 case numbers to local health agencies within 48 hours if they “meet the definition of a COVID-19 outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir6agD"&gt;“As our nation continues to battle the pandemic, it is absolutely critical that businesses do their part to protect workers now — and especially during this holiday season,” Bonta said in the press release. “Californians have a right to know about potential exposures to the coronavirus to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fpUsl"&gt;Amazon was criticized for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes"&gt;treatment of workers&lt;/a&gt; throughout the pandemic. Last March, Michigan warehouse workers were angered when &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;Amazon failed to notify them&lt;/a&gt; that their coworker had COVID-19, meanwhile, workers in New York &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;staged walkouts&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to Amazon’s handling of the pandemic. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259474/amazon-warehouse-worker-death-indiana"&gt;refused to say&lt;/a&gt; how many of its warehouse workers were sick across the country, only to eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;disclose a number&lt;/a&gt; in October of 2020. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;vaccines have become available&lt;/a&gt; to almost everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757927/amazon-lifts-mask-mandates-vaccinated-warehouse-employees"&gt;Amazon lifted mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinated employees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;plans to let corporate workers return to the office in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
