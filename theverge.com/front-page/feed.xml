    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNi04P"&gt;Netflix just brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;its new gaming service to all subscribers on Android&lt;/a&gt;, but now it has officially come to iOS. The service gives users access to a limited selection of mobile games without ads or in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGhJRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1458133903160479746?s=20"&gt;A tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman confirms that the five launch games are already available as individual downloads from the App Store. These include &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 The Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u51TzA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix Games is coming to iOS! Starting tomorrow, you can access Netflix Games through the Netflix app on any mobile device, anywhere in the world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoHYFi4xBX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoHYFi4xBX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iJK7mE"&gt;There’s been some concern about Netflix Games’ rollout on iOS, particularly because of Apple’s App Store policies that have gotten in the way of other gaming platforms and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUnXxq"&gt;The policy typically prevents third-party apps from acting as storefronts for apps. Per the tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393"&gt;@NetflixGeeked&lt;/a&gt;, tomorrow we’ll find out how Netflix adjusts its main app and if it serves as an all-in-one gaming hub like it does on Android, where users can select games to download from the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJfD7f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple backs off of breaking Face ID after DIY iPhone 13 screen replacements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V0rR1qwozg8-bZtX-ZEVQyrZl6s=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117678/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="beNaVw"&gt;Soon after the iPhone 13 launched, repair experts found that swapping out iPhone 13 screens would break Face ID unless you also moved over a tiny control chip from the original screen. It’s a complex process that makes one of the most common types of repairs prohibitively difficult for independent repair shops. (Apple-authorized repair shops, on the other hand, have access to a software tool that can make a phone accept a new screen.) For indie repair shops, things may get easier soon, however, as Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will release a software update that doesn't require you to transfer the microcontroller to keep Face ID working after a screen swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRdBHh"&gt;The current transfer procedure looks to be quite challenging, requiring time, special equipment, and the ability to microsolder. For many independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a key line of revenue, the process is likely prohibitively difficult and could be damaging to their business. iFixit detailed the situation &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772433%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at length&lt;/a&gt; in an article last week, and you can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;a video of the microcontroller transfer process here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mOwVT"&gt;Apple didn’t specify exactly when the software update will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest League of Legends spinoff is coming to Netflix Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dz-Ll2TVmfLqZ65WpSWFMKxLmcQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117622/hextech_mayhem.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNmMwA"&gt;Riot is bringing a new &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;experience to Netflix Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LH77oP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993328/riot-forge-publishing-label-league-of-legends-games"&gt;Riot Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a publishing subsidiary of Riot Games dedicated to smaller, self-contained games within the League of Legends universe in collaboration with Bit.Trip developer Choice Provisions, announced its latest game: &lt;a href="https://hextechmayhem.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bb5z9G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem &lt;/em&gt;is a rhythm game in which you bounce &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;characters Ziggs and Heimerdinger to the beat of the music, unleashing city-busting bombs along the way. In addition to being available on Switch and PC on November 19th, the game will also be available at a later date to Netflix subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiFO1t"&gt;Netflix recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;it’s integrating games into its mobile app&lt;/a&gt;. While the initial offering of games was lackluster, this latest announcement hints at the kind of titles we can expect from Netflix in the future while adding an enticing value proposition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;Netflix as a gaming service&lt;/a&gt;. While players on other platforms will have to pay $10 for the pleasure, &lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem&lt;/em&gt; will be free on mobile to Netflix subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRJTjS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem&lt;/em&gt; coming to Netflix Games is the latest development in the Netflix / Riot partnership. This week, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series exclusively on Netflix — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;debuted with positive reviews&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix also announced its games will now be available on iOS devices starting November 10th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emily Ratajkowski confronts her power — and yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/prtVZp0XBo8oOG-xfI4Vvgidt4E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117532/EMILY_NEW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Michelle Rohn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The model talks about her new book, copyright law, online harassment, and OnlyFans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8Bvbj"&gt;Emily Ratajkowski knows how to play the game. Walking out of a bathroom nude before she’d hit it big, she marvels at how a powerful fashion photographer has fallen right into her trap: dismissing her as dumb, wanting to see her naked, then being shocked and impressed at the sight of her body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03teNr"&gt;“When I came out of the bathroom topless, I stood up straight, not covering my breasts,” she writes in her memoir &lt;em&gt;My Body&lt;/em&gt;. “I believed that by taking off my clothes proudly, by not letting myself be embarrassed by my nakedness, I might somehow intimidate you, shifting the dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1J4URe"&gt;She does not. While Ratajkowski lands the job, she’s still reliant on sleazy men to get a paycheck. Now, as she reflects on the ways she’s capitalized on her own sex appeal, she’s wrestling with the central question: “What is the power of my body? Is it even &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; power?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvU8gw"&gt;It’s a question hinted at in Jia Tolentino’s essay &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/decade-in-review/the-age-of-instagram-face"&gt;“The Age of Instagram Face,”&lt;/a&gt; where she compares women who get plastic surgery to McKinsey consultants assessing a corporation, identifying underperforming assets and optimizing them for profit. The metaphor points to how broken the system is, but it also speaks to the natural inclination we all have to use the gifts we were born with to our advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQnnEE"&gt;Perhaps this is why Ratajkowski is hesitant to dismiss other women for their choices. Like Tolentino, she’s looking at the whole system, seeing the still-limited ways women can try to gain power. “That’s what I feel about any woman deciding to modify her image and body,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “It’s like, ‘Of course she wants to do that. That’s the world we live in, and it’s a commodifiable asset.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL8mPe"&gt;Now, as the owner of a thriving direct-to-consumer swimwear line Inamorata, Ratajkowski is able to control her image and the end-product — a kind of vertical integration for the modeling industry. Is this real power? She’s not sure. “It’s still capitalism and it’s still selling clothes,” she says. “So I have problems around the girl boss politics of like, ‘There you go. That’s feminism. We did it.’ It’s just more complicated than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHe8O2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QqqMRa"&gt;
&lt;p id="zoKoDu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book started with an article in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Mag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about who owns your image. What inspired you to write that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFqFMi"&gt;So, actually, &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; chose that essay out of the book proposal. It wasn’t the first essay I wrote. The book had been written and they were cool enough to choose one of the longer pieces, which I wasn’t expecting. That one came from having many, many experiences in my lifetime about both capitalizing off of my image and also feeling like others were capitalizing off of it without my control. And I was interested in that idea of all these Emilys in the world that were floating around. And while it was my livelihood, it also seemed not to belong to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPUSdn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious if the experience of writing that, and processing the fact that your image is yours and not yours at the same time, has changed how you go about signing modeling contracts. Do you think you could be in a position again where a photographer was able to exploit a photoshoot and essentially create subsequent projects that you don’t really have control over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5ws6m"&gt;I would say, never say never. Because I’ve had that experience and other experiences that I didn’t write about, I’m forever worried about that. And I’ve done so many photoshoots in my life, starting at a very young age. My modeling agency was in control of tons and tons of girls and was supposed to be protecting us, but also they’re not planning on our long-term careers. They’re not thinking about that. So I don’t know how many photographers have a hard drive of images of me that I have no ownership over. That’s just the reality of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMRXhP"&gt;But definitely because of that experience and knowing what it can be like, I now am very crazy about language in contracts and am always trying to tie up every loose end and make sure I’m protected. But that being said, there are still loopholes. Nothing’s ever completely airtight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlFG48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a case that’s going on right now with a paparazzo who is suing you for posting an Instagram image of yourself — and you’re fighting back in court. It seems like this is an instance where you are trying to regain some power by making an argument about fair use, but the system is kind of working against you. The judge recently ruled that you violated the paparazzo’s copyright. What’s on your mind with the latest development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Jiz5"&gt;I wasn’t sure that I was going to win. And just to be clear, settling out of court and paying this paparazzi whatever x amount of dollars would’ve been the more financially smart decision for me. So I knew what I was getting myself into by deciding to go down this road, that it was going to be a battle. In some ways, it was more of a long-term versus short-term decision because I just felt more and more paparazzi could continue to sue me. And I wanted to send a message that I was going to fight back and also push these ideas more into the public eye so that people aren’t just like, “Oh yeah, whatever, copyright law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8o8oCO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book, there’s a chapter called Blurred Lines where you write, “In my early twenties, it never occurred to me that the women who gained their power from beauty were indebted to the men whose desire granted them that power in the first place.” You echo it in a later chapter when you say, “What is the power of my body? Is it even my power?” It’s the underlying theme, in some ways, of the whole book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="impLmz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It got me thinking that this is a lot of how internet celebrity works for women. It seems like with women who get famous on the internet, there’s this way in which you’re famous because people want to be you or they want to be with you. But ultimately, it’s the companies cutting your sponsorship deals that have the real money and power. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4aj4A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious if you agree and if you’ve answered that question for yourself: is the power of your body your power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8JEm5"&gt;No, I haven’t answered that question for myself. I wish I had an answer for it, honestly. I think that you hit the nail on the head. It’s like when I think about OnlyFans and everything that’s going on with OnlyFans. It’s such a perfect example of that. It’s like women were trying to have an answer to the internet’s huge revenge porn issue and say like, “No, we’re going to be in control. We’re going to be the ones capitalizing off of our images.” But then you have a server that ultimately is profiting off of them and has the power to shut down the way that they make money at any point because their investors have decided that they’ve had enough of the sexy stuff or whatever. So I think that there are ways for women to have success and to have control by using and commodifying their image and their body. But ultimately it’s within the confines of larger power structures that mean that their position is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQZouB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has having your own business, Inamorata, changed that at all for you? It seems like now, at least in that context, you are the model &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the product creator. But it also seems like, and you write about this in the book, there’s a direct line between the sales of the direct-to-consumer swimsuits and whether or not you are actually in the pictures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBmrMN"&gt;Yeah. It definitely feels better to be the one in control and the one making decisions about how I’m going to profit off of my image and my body. And it’s fun to work with other women that I like and make clothes that I like, but it’s... I don’t know if I would say that it’s true empowerment because it’s still capitalism and it’s still selling clothes. So I have problems around the girl boss politics of like, “There you go. That’s feminism. We did it.” It’s just more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc5N1Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also true that this project is self-funded — it’s all your own investment. But if we look at the wider world of girl bosses, they’re still having to go to men to ask for more money, to ask for support and investment. It’s hard to get total control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8stxeU"&gt;Yeah and we have not done that yet. I don’t have any outside investors, partly because I just can’t stand the thought of having to convince some guy in a suit to give us money, which is weird because that’s the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFq9Ws"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that you’ll keep modeling for other people if you don’t have to, from a financial perspective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjCt6F"&gt;It’s really hard because the money’s good and I have a kid now and I have a lot of responsibilities and, honestly, writing isn’t exactly an amazing way to make money. So one of the things that I love about modeling and working for other people is that it buys me time — I write about that in the book. Even initially, that was the appeal. My friends had to work really hard at cafes or service industry jobs, and I could go shoot a job one day a week or a month and make what they were making by working many, many hours. And even just being able to write this book was because I had time. So I like the opportunities that modeling allows me. But I think if I could, if I felt financially secure enough, I would absolutely probably stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KI12lU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You figured out early on in your career that there was a real benefit to be had in keeping your weight down and conforming to current standard beauty standards. It reminded me of this line, from Jia Tolentino’s book —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UR1Oax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trick Mirror&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6l3EA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, exactly. She writes about women looking at their bodies like a McKinsey consultant looks at a corporation, in terms of what can be modified and improved. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptzt2L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a phenomenon I’ve seen with a lot of the young TikTok stars. They get famous in part because they’re very approachable. But then to stay famous, like when they get the Hulu deal, you start to see them conform more and more to beauty standards. I’m curious if that’s something you’ve seen and something you think about with today’s social media stars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk3SB8"&gt;Yeah, I’m so interested in that phenomenon because I see it all the time. Like now, I’ve been famous for eight-something years and I watch women come in and they have this charm about them and then slowly their boobs get a little bigger or they lose a little bit of weight or their nose gets a little smaller, whatever. And of course they do. They become very hyper aware of how they’re perceived and they know that their value increases the more they fit the mold. So they’re just being smart, which is the sad truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVjy4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You touch on this, too, in the book. When you’re in a capitalist system, you take the assets you have and you optimize them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8y0ZH"&gt;Yeah, that’s a huge theme of the book. That’s what I feel about any woman deciding to modify her image and body. It’s like, “Of course she wants to do that. That’s the world we live in and it’s a commodifiable asset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ge4VF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a section of the book and in the essay where you talk about some of the comments you’ve received on Instagram, people feeling very entitled to say cruel or very sexual things about your body and your image. I know that there’s an IRL version of this in the modeling industry, but I’m curious if you think about the internet making women particularly vulnerable to that type of harassment or critique and if there’s any real way around that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w009BY"&gt;I don’t think there’s any real way around it. I definitely think that the IRL version is just so different. The things that people say online, no one, even the nastiest person in fashion, would say in real life. It’s what everyone talks about, you’re hiding behind your screen, you think you’re anonymous. Sometimes I’m really shocked. I try not to look at comments, but of course I do sometimes. And I’ll click on someone’s profile because I’m just so curious who this person is that will say this incredibly hurtful and very specific thing. And it’s just a person who’s walking around and I think about what it does for them? I’ve definitely been a fan, but I’ve also always been a public persona as that kind of culture has risen. So I’ve never been able to relate or empathize with people who do that. And it must be satisfying in some way because so many people partake in it — it’s really sad. It says something bad about people’s mental health and where we are as a culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwlpBC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your way of dealing with that? You mentioned you try not to look at the comments. Do you ever try to engage or report them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6ZYP"&gt;No, I don’t. I’ve found, unfortunately, that sometimes the high road is the best road, which doesn’t feel satisfying in the same way that writing a nasty retort would be. This is something I write about in the book. With moments that I’ve protested the use of my image, for example, it ends up just bringing more attention. And so I don’t want to bring attention to that person and their comment, so I try to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzb3CD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious what speaking up about the way that you’ve been treated by powerful men has cost you, if anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUptNB"&gt;So it’s interesting because one of the first interviews I did around the book was with a man, and he asked me if I was concerned about the consequences for Robin Thicke. I was like, “Wait, for me or for Robin Thicke?” And he was like, “For Robin Thicke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fULZcR"&gt;Then, out of my control, some media outlet broke an embargo and leaked two sentences from what I hope was a pretty nuanced essay and just put those tag lines out into the world. And it’s been pretty brutal for me online. I would say 99 percent of Twitter is either saying that I’m low on money and therefore that’s why I’m talking about this now, or something about how I was dancing around naked, what did I expect? So the idea that our culture is shifted and that men need to be scared now, I haven’t experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMCO7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was it important for you to wait to speak out about what you’ve experienced until you had a bigger platform? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRKHeu"&gt;I didn’t think about it as speaking out. I felt like, “Okay, this is a perfect example of the full truth of my experience and therefore I want to include it in the book because I want people to understand what I’ve learned about myself and how I’ve evolved as a person.” But it didn’t feel like, “Oh, I’m speaking out.” Blurred Lines my editor basically had to force me to write. Initially, that experience was hidden in another essay — it was like two paragraphs. And it was one of the things that when we first started to dive into the book proposal, she was like, “This needs to be its own essay, it’s such a telling experience.” And I was really afraid that it was going to become what it has in this exact moment before the book’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLL1EW"&gt;In the galley, in the version you read, it was the first essay. I ended up making it the second essay because I just felt like it wasn’t the right thing. I think for me, it just feels like I have had so many people question my reality and question my experience. And I felt so frustrated with it that it wasn’t a choice of like, “I’m going to speak out.” It was just like, “I have to put this thing out into the world to validate my reality.” That was it. I knew there were going to be all these really hard parts about it, but that yearning drove me all the way to where I am now, which is publishing this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJkWli"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has your thinking about the nuances of putting your image on the internet changed since becoming a mom? You tend to block out your baby’s face a lot in Instagram photos. How are you thinking about Sly’s image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTqXON"&gt;So I actually posted a picture of his face last weekend for the first time. And it was because we live in New York City and paparazzi had shot him, and you could Google his face anyway. And again, taking back control, I don’t like the idea of exploiting my beautiful baby’s image through Instagram. I’ve signed up for this life, but he hasn’t. But he is a part of my life and I also am proud of him and I don’t want other pictures of him that I don’t have control over out there instead. So that was the decision my husband and I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJM0QF"&gt;It might change, I don’t know. I’m learning. I might go to being like, “No, I love sharing pictures of him,” or I might go back to just not showing his face at all. I’m not sure. But that’s where I am in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnTCko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have anything next on the docket writing-wise? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxzh4w"&gt;I have actually been thinking about writing about putting this book out into the world and cancel culture and media and clickbait culture, and my experience with that. I’ve started to write it and then I just feel pretty exhausted because I’ve been talking about this book so much. Writing it and editing it was such an amazing experience, but publishing it is... I’m not sure what it’s going to be like yet, and I’m nervous about it and I think that’s keeping me from writing. But I definitely plan on writing other books. At this moment in time, I would say that I’d be interested in trying my hand at fiction, just out of self-protection. But I also just really like writing from life, so we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElMITp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want people to take away from the book? It feels like, with the leaks, people will have their own interpretations. But I would imagine that anyone who really engages with the text will have a really different takeaway. What are you hoping that the message will be for people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Z849"&gt;That’s nice of you to say. When I’m in a good mood in the last couple days, I’ve been like, “Well, maybe more people will read the book because there’s all this chatter.” I don’t know. That’s the only positive I can take away from that. I really want to start conversations, and I say this in the book, I don’t have answers. I don’t know exactly what feminism or empowerment is. But I do think that women’s experiences, the female experience, what it means to be in a body as a woman, our reality is so frequently dismissed and ignored even by other women. And I do find through my close female friendships, that there is a baseline truth to what we know about our lives and our position in the world. And I want that to become something that is an understood thing between women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xKdbbl"&gt;So I guess my hope is that by putting these really personal vulnerable experiences out in the world, that other women will feel like it gives them permission to talk about their experiences. And instead of feeling like it’s something wrong with them or that they’re so specific, they’ll realize that there’s context for this and there’s a reason that we have so many shared experiences. That’s it, I think. That’s my biggest hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESjcj8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOzG7S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massive Comcast Xfinity outage disconnects TV and internet across the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile Service Introduces New 5G Unlimited Data Options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4k4rU5jGGHxRaHByu_zxoR8BAE=/0x0:6036x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116289/1232480552.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Fusco/Getty Images for Comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6KDbb"&gt;This morning many Comcast Xfinity subscribers woke up without their usual services. Reports indicate the system was down, or at least unsteady, in areas stretching from Chicago to Philadelphia, New Jersey, and South Carolina. Looking at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/xfinity/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, issues had been reported earlier in the Bay Area, but it’s unclear if those are connected to the problems people saw this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEvQBi"&gt;Comcast has released a statement regarding the outage. According to a spokesperson, “Earlier, some customers experienced intermittent service disruptions as a result of a network issue. We have addressed the issue and service is now restoring for impacted customers, as we continue to investigate the root cause. We apologize to those who were affected.” It appears that most of the people who reported problems have confirmed they’re back online. There’s still no word on exactly what caused the problem or how many people were impacted at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C3XcLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Earlier, some customers experienced intermittent service disruptions as a result of a network issue. We have addressed the issue and service is now restoring for impacted customers, as we continue to investigate the root cause. We apologize to those who were affected.&lt;/p&gt;— Xfinity Support (@XfinitySupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XfinitySupport/status/1458113028935794703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSuUCQ"&gt;A message on the company’s outage status page (if you could reach it, which many people couldn’t) noted an issue and said it would be resolved at 10:49AM ET, without revealing why it had such a specific timeline. Customers trying to reach phone support reported only getting a dial tone or error message in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5m35Z"&gt;Some people, like me, were able to get online this morning without an issue while using Comcast’s cable internet, but the number of reports from home and business customers alike shows the issue was widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtfXmb"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Squid Game director confirms season two, says he’s in the ‘planning process’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q47KJC2M5p7RFaCQq-2hRZTURxo=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117293/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.32.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CjxZyP"&gt;If you’re still reeling from the end of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; season one, get ready to board the emotional rollercoaster once again because season two is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="15mw7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;COMEBACK SQUID: Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director, creator, writer of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SquidGame?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SquidGame&lt;/a&gt; says the show will be back with more Gi-hun adventures. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uqC1DIdZqy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uqC1DIdZqy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/APEntertainment/status/1458060909319004170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBTwH3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; tweeted out a brief clip of an interview with director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who confirms that season two is in the works. “I will say there will indeed be a second season,” Dong-hyuk tells &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; while standing next to Lee Jung-jae, the actor who plays &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;’s beloved protagonist, Gi-hun. “It’s in my head right now. I’m in the planning process currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFIARu"&gt;It really doesn’t come as a surprise that Netflix gave the series the green light for season two, considering that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;the platform’s most-watched show at launch&lt;/a&gt;, raking in 111 million viewers after airing for just 17 days. &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is such a hit that Netflix even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761602/netflix-squid-game-director-movies"&gt;added three more films directed by Dong-hyuk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzLLH"&gt;“There’s been so much pressure, so much demand, and so much love for a second season. So I almost feel like you leave us no choice,” Dong-hyuk continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhQ2N"&gt;While Dong-hyuk says that it’s “too early” to determine when or how season two will be released, he did give us a small hint at what’s to come: “I will promise you this: Gi-hun will come back — he will do something for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new $249 Surface Laptop SE is its first true Chromebook competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBu2b9NK2G_nxYrZK5n9yMJ_tB8=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117225/COMR_Feature_02_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE is designed for schools.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmEkjs"&gt;Microsoft is going head to head with Chromebooks with a new $249 Surface Laptop SE, its most affordable Surface yet. While the software giant has attempted to compete with the popularity of Chrome OS in US schools for years, the Surface Laptop SE is the company’s first true Chromebook competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkXeT6"&gt;Surface Laptop SE will be sold exclusively to schools and students, starting at $249. It’s part of a much broader effort with Windows 11 SE, a new student edition designed to compete with Chrome OS that will ship on a range of low-cost laptops in the coming months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22535783"&gt;You can read all about Windows 11 SE right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MW4W8o2CmL49D6yl6ZOLGjLLNOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998165/COMR_Feature_03_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE is all plastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="veNfSF"&gt;Surface Laptop SE is every bit the low-cost Windows device you’d expect to see for $249. While it retains the same keyboard and trackpad found on Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Go, the all-plastic body houses an 11.6-inch display running at just a 1366 x 768 resolution. This is the first 16:9 Surface device in more than seven years, after Microsoft switched to 3:2 for its Surface line with the Surface Pro 3 launch in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKrxqZ"&gt;The screen looks like the biggest drawback on this device, particularly as we weren’t fans of the low-resolution screen (1536 x 1024) found on the $549 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Surface Laptop Go&lt;/a&gt;. Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet ships with a better 10.1-inch (1920 x 1200) display for the same $249 price as the Surface Laptop SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpIoIX"&gt;Intel’s Celeron N4020 or N4120 power the Surface Laptop SE, combined with 4GB / 8GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of eMMC storage. Microsoft is including a 1-megapixel front-facing camera that offers 720P support, so it should hold up okay for Teams meetings. The Surface Laptop SE also includes a single USB-A port, one USB-C port, a regular barrel-type DC connector, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That means this is also the first Surface laptop to ship without Microsoft’s magnetic Surface charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVNxKBmn5LZCB5cer1AHIrwkeiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998167/COMR_Feature_01_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE ships with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aXoEmf"&gt;That’s not the only first for the Surface Laptop SE, though. Microsoft is committing to a big repairability effort with the Surface Laptop SE, allowing schools to replace components inside the laptop. The base of the Surface Laptop SE has standard screws that will allow IT admins to replace the display, battery, keyboard, and even the motherboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9imMTD"&gt;Microsoft has spent the past 18 months talking to IT admins about the pain points of managing laptops in schools, and repairability was one of the top concerns. Microsoft will sell spare parts through its authorized service providers, and it should mean schools can replace components on site instead of having to send devices for repair and wait days or weeks for them to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZBjgm"&gt;We’re expecting to see similar repairability in other Surface laptops in the future, as Microsoft has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715241/microsoft-as-you-sow-right-to-repair-study-agreement"&gt;make its devices easier to repair&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DG1o1z"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Surface Laptop SE in early 2022 starting at $249, available in the US, UK, Canada, and Japan. A range of Windows 11 SE laptops will also be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s new $800 AT-AT is practically big enough to conquer a real-life Rebel base</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQzdfFC6qI5F6iwfjuGXdlMVegQ=/0x1:4035x2691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117219/lego_ucs_at_at_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wv2THe"&gt;Lego has announced its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fat-at-75313&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22772264%2Flego-star-wars-at-at-ultimate-collectors-edition-ucs-price-release-date-bricks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest supersized Star Wars set&lt;/a&gt;: an $800, 6,785-piece replica of the iconic AT-AT tank, most famously seen assaulting the Rebel base on Hoth in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU82Mc"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the new set is part of the Lego Ultimate Collector Series lineup, which has offered ultra-accurate (and ultra-pricey) recreations of classic Star Wars ships and characters for years, like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Frepublic-gunship-75309&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22772264%2Flego-star-wars-at-at-ultimate-collectors-edition-ucs-price-release-date-bricks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently released Republic Gunship&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397289/lego-new-r2-d2-star-wars-droid-may-4th-release-date-price"&gt;adorable R2-D2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLZ22A"&gt;And while Lego has released plenty of AT-AT sets before, none of them are anything close to as cool as the new one, which stands 24.5 inches high and measures 27 inches long, with posable legs and removable sides to show off the interiors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9Dl4lnngxok8GHFx_3p11dMOi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998871/lego_ucs_at_at.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aw65PV"&gt;The troop carrier is also fit to carry a (Lego-sized) Imperial legion, too: while the set only includes nine minifigures — General Veers, a Snowtrooper Commander, four Snowtroopers and two AT-AT Drivers, along with an attacking Luke Skywalker to dangle underneath — the set can fit a whopping 40 figures inside (assuming you’ve got the Stormtroopers to fill it with). The UCS AT-AT also has room for up to four speeder bikes (although sadly, only two are included) and a tripod gun for a complete Imperial attack force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C0rFad"&gt;As part of the attention to detail here, the set also features “posable legs and head, opening hatches, cannons with a realistic recoil action, rotating cannons, bomb-drop hatch, and a hook to attach to Luke Skywalker’s line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cbhnew"&gt;That all said, while the gigantic AT-AT does indeed look great, it’s still not quite on the level of Lego’s magnum opus of Star Wars sets: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;2017 Ultimate Collectors Series Millennium Falcon&lt;/a&gt;, which (at least at the time) sold for the same eye-watering $800 price but had more pieces, more minifigures, and a far more iconic ship. The AT-AT just can’t quite compete with the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPSxn7"&gt;The new Lego UCS AT-AT set will be on sale on November 26th from Lego’s website — just in time for the holidays, assuming you can snag one. For now, we’ve dug up the highest-resolution photos we can find so you can blow them up and check out all that detail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s gaming push could be its secret sauce for continued domination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emueazP9M1bQYL2LNJJpBBPBvmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117164/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VrFyxS"&gt;Netflix is finally mixing games into its gargantuan library of content. It’s a huge power play and a markedly different approach from rival services that are primarily focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;snapping up IP&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new way for Netflix to keep subscribers hooked on its service — and gaming could just be its winning play for continued streaming dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsONlc"&gt;Netflix has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18659999/stranger-things-mobile-game-netflix-walking-dead-pokemon-go-e3-2019"&gt;experimenting with gaming&lt;/a&gt; for a hot minute, but the global rollout of games within the Netflix app itself, announced last week, marks a significant shift in the streamer’s strategy for getting those games to its users. (Games began rolling out to Android devices last week, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; that an iOS launch is “on the way.”) Netflix’s games will now be accessible to users much like movies, TV shows, and originals are, and they’ll be able to launch right from within the app once downloaded through the App or Play stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnuBTy"&gt;Netflix executives have said repeatedly that they think of their product as competing with everything from &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/4/17/15334122/netflix-sleep-competitor-amazon-hbo"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/05/tiktok-and-instagram-inch-closer-to-streaming-wars.html"&gt;social media apps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-fortnite-competition-q4-earnings-2019-1"&gt;games themselves&lt;/a&gt; — essentially anything you could be doing besides watching Netflix. Netflix is competing now with more streaming and content-serving services than at any other time in its history — not only the HBO Maxes and YouTubes and Hulus of the streaming space but other apps like Instagram and TikTok. By introducing more points of entry to its content — in this case, games that build upon and expand the worlds of its existing titles — it could be safeguarding against decreased use among users who might otherwise turn to these other services or apps for entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqbXK7"&gt;Richard Broughton, a research director with Ampere Analysis, says that the firm’s recent analysis on Netflix usage underscores this goal. Every six months, Ampere polls roughly 50,000 consumers in various markets worldwide to understand how they’re using various apps and services. In its last couple of waves of research, Ampere has noticed not only stagnation but a slight erosion of subscribers in the 18- to 24-year-old bracket, Broughton tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZewWQ"&gt;“In other words, people who might’ve previously picked up Netflix among that age bracket are leaving and getting interested in other services that are coming on board, whether that’s the new studio-backed services in the US or perhaps social video services — TikTok, for instance,” Broughton says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTAaLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People who might’ve previously picked up Netflix among that age bracket are leaving and getting interested in other services”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP2278"&gt;What Netflix is essentially doing with games, then, is creating additional value and entertainment that could help it compete with rival services that might otherwise eat into a subscriber’s media consumption time, particularly where it concerns younger consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJz44X"&gt;“Netflix has long stated that gaming is one of the big competitors of the time, so I guess it’s part of the adage that ‘if you can’t beat them, join them,’” Broughton says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snSNiD"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; that it wants to develop games “for any level of play and every kind of player, whether you’re a beginner or a lifelong gamer.” Because the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1455580571959054341"&gt;has also said&lt;/a&gt; its games will be offered through the service as exclusives with “no ads, no additional fees and no in-app purchases” as a result of the sheer size of its subscriber base, Netflix is positioned to become a formidable presence in the subscription gaming space, Broughton says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlIA6H"&gt;“From one perspective, you could argue that Netflix is attempting to steal a bit of the market with some of the new, emerging subscription gaming platforms,” Broughton says. “Its offering still looks very different because it’s so mobile-centric as opposed to a lot of these platforms, which are focusing on Triple-A games. Nonetheless, it’s a foothold in the market and helps the company to experiment. And I suspect we’ll begin to see bigger and better games as time goes by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GB7ye6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you can’t beat them, join them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Am8PRl"&gt;However, with a modest offering at launch, Netflix’s global launch on Android had just five games available — we’re quite a ways out from Netflix being a gaming competitor in earnest, says Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner. Bonner tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while games certainly make Netflix more “sticky,” it’ll likely be some time before we understand how games are actually impacting the service in any meaningful way. While Bonner thinks it’s a smart business strategy, in the grand scheme of Netflix’s business at present, he says, “this is a very small part of the pie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06w2BW"&gt;Netflix may be starting small on games, but the company has said it wants “to begin to build a library of games that offers something for everyone.” And Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;made it clear that it values games&lt;/a&gt; above merely swiping up whatever IP scraps are being picked over by other services. As Broughton notes, Netflix may even experiment with more advanced gaming down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dP1s51"&gt;Still, Broughton believes Netflix’s launch of games within the app itself is “absolutely essential” to ensuring widespread adoption. It lowers the barrier to entry and makes it easier for Netflix to woo potential gamers who might have otherwise missed its games entirely. And if Netflix is hoping to make itself even more addictive than it already is, games might just be the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Windows 11 SE, a new Chrome OS competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPRXnyePUIy43ow1KiT7opOr7x8=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117122/WIN22_Hybrid_Learning_11SE_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 SE is a new edition of Windows for students.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xI3Mgu"&gt;Microsoft has created a new edition of Windows 11 designed for students and schools. Windows 11 SE will ship exclusively on low-cost laptops that are built for K-8 classrooms, and it marks another attempt by Microsoft to take on Google’s range of Chromebooks and their popularity in US schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii40fF"&gt;Microsoft has struggled to understand why schools and students have flocked to Chromebooks. The company tried an S Mode previously that essentially locked Windows 10 down to apps from the Microsoft Store. The restriction was more of an irritation for end users and schools, as there weren’t enough apps available in the Microsoft Store for it to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iOfx0vvbYKYPCLlnekJoJI2FJjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998135/Win11SE_start.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 SE comes with all the key Microsoft 365 apps preinstalled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ipl3gc"&gt;Windows 11 SE takes a different approach to a Windows edition for schools, and it’s a similar direction where Microsoft was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;originally heading with Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt; before its cancelation. Windows 11 SE will only be available on new low-cost devices and only for schools and education customers. While Windows 11 SE is, naturally, optimized for Microsoft Edge, Office, and Microsoft’s cloud-based services, it’s not restricted to just Microsoft apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQQM9W"&gt;“Windows 11 SE also supports third-party apps, including Zoom and Chrome, because we want to give schools the choice to use what works best for them,” says Paige Johnson, head of Microsoft’s education marketing. IT admins will be in charge of what apps get installed, and devices can be managed to silently update outside of class time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25FNx1"&gt;Most of the Windows 11 SE changes are fairly minor, though. Microsoft has spent the past 18 months talking to teachers and students to get feedback on its efforts to date on low-cost Windows laptops. That feedback has led to apps always launching in fullscreen mode on Windows 11 SE, and Microsoft has removed the multiple Snap Layouts in this edition in favor of a single mode that lets you place apps side by side. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/salytP17uGHvpt2e9QCt8bIvZa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998136/w11SE_snap1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has simplified Snap Layouts in Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M0fKPv"&gt;The new Widgets section of Windows 11 has also been removed in SE, as Microsoft found it’s distracting in a classroom environment. Microsoft Edge will also be configured to accept Chrome extensions, which is turned off by default on Windows 11. Many schools in the US rely on Chrome extensions as part of their Chrome OS usage, so this change is a clear recognition of that. Windows 11 SE also backs up documents to OneDrive by default, with offline support to make it easier for students to use these Windows 11 SE laptops beyond just the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqeCXg"&gt;Windows 11 SE will also ship with a new colorful Bloom wallpaper by default and some changes to the way apps are bundled. While you might experience having two different versions of OneNote or Teams in Windows 11, Microsoft is cleaning this up in Windows 11 SE so only a single version is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYMKAu"&gt;Windows 11 SE will only be available on low-cost laptops that are sold to schools. Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo are all creating Windows 11 SE laptops in the coming months. Microsoft even has its own $249 Surface Laptop SE, which sets the stage for Windows 11 SE. The base model ships with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC storage, and an 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22535819"&gt;You can read all about the Surface Laptop SE right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWYme5"&gt;The Surface Laptop SE specs demonstrate the type of low-cost devices that will ship with Windows 11 SE. Microsoft tells us it has made a lot of performance improvements tuned towards 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage devices, so hopefully Windows 11 SE holds up well on these low-cost laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzzG5HslQPelxuONhds7VZNZyYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998137/COMR_Feature_02_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $249 Surface Laptop SE ships with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vkOmoC"&gt;Windows 11 SE, which according to Microsoft isn’t intended to be short for anything, is also a big part of the company’s overall efforts to compete with Chrome OS. Microsoft has often overlooked what makes Chrome OS so easy to use and manage for IT admins and schools, and Windows 11 SE laptops will now be ready to talk to Microsoft Intune straight away for setup purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6gzE8"&gt;That makes it easier for IT admins to provision these devices with a more simplified backend management console for education. Microsoft is also bundling apps like Teams, Office, OneNote, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft for Education&lt;/em&gt;, and Flipgrid in Windows 11 SE so IT admins don’t have to install them separately. This should make it easier for students to simply open up a Windows 11 SE laptop, type their login information, and instantly get access to their apps and cloud documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCuF0R"&gt;Microsoft is expecting Windows 11 SE laptops to arrive in education channels later this year and into 2022, just as the education buying season begins.&lt;/p&gt;
