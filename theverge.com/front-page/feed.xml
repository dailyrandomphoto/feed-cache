    <title>Acer’s new 17.3-inch Nitro 5 seems like a lot of bang for your buck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FB0zkfgmoZFW41fzSa0IgUOlVY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950036/acernitro52021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lW9aZ"&gt;Acer has refreshed its Nitro 5 lineup of entry-level gaming laptops for the second half of 2021, and its new 17.3-inch model launching in mid-October seems particularly impressive given its $1,199.99 price. Its 1080p display has a 144Hz refresh rate, and it comes equipped with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. (Acer hasn’t specified the CPU model or what the maximum graphics power of the GPU will be.) Other specs include 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB SSD. That sounds like a solid gaming laptop to me, so long as you’re not expecting too much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TndUFB"&gt;If you want something smaller, Acer also has a 15.6-inch version coming in mid-October for $769.99. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate screen, but as you might have guessed with the $400 price difference, there’s more than just size that gets a reduction here. It has an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 256GB SSD, and on the graphics side of things, it features the Nvidia GTX 1650. This should still be able to do some light gaming, but it’ll likely be a more compromised experience than what the 17.3-inch can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b8cYw"&gt;Both models have an ethernet port and a Thunderbolt 4 port, in addition to three USB-A ports, HDMI out, a 3.5mm jack, and a Kensington slot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UplLxr5Tks_TB1acuud3oK0YZus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900721/acernitro52021_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro 5 charges via the barrel plug port on its side instead of its rear, where it was located on the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dPNhAV"&gt;Acer gave the latest Nitro 5 just a couple of minor design adjustments that make it stand out a bit compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;to the early 2021 model&lt;/a&gt;. It still has a red and black colorway with edges that taper off, along with a full-size keyboard. The barrel plug charger now plugs in along the right side of the laptop instead of its back, and parts of its lid and chassis appear to have a grippier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADumaN"&gt;If you just got the Nitro 5 or a similar gaming laptop earlier this year, these upgrades don’t seem like must-haves. But if you’re in the market for a 17.3-inch machine, Acer’s latest seems like a fantastic value.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Planning to upgrade to Windows 11? A checklist before you do</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7dQzx-iJ-i2TCh7CjJLQSsm_Nnc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950018/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irnYQM"&gt;I don’t know what else to call it: the Windows 11 upgrade situation is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643275/windows-11-upgrade-system-requirements-pc-health-check"&gt;confusing mess&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on when your PC was built, which components you chose, and how it was configured, there’s a decent chance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686457/windows-11-health-check-compatible-supported-cpu-old-pc-waiver"&gt;Microsoft will try to scare you away&lt;/a&gt; from installing the free upgrade, which is available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709166/microsoft-windows-11-release-download-available"&gt;a day early today&lt;/a&gt;. Millions of people will likely be told their systems are incompatible, and Microsoft is reserving the right to withhold security updates if you install on older systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qo3G58"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"},{"title":"Microsoft releases Windows 11 a day early","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709166/microsoft-windows-11-release-download-available"},{"title":"How to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for free","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708478/microsoft-windows-11-upgrade-free-os-how-to-download"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vSQV72"&gt;But as far as we can tell, Windows 11 is largely Windows 10 with a fresh coat of paint, and there’s a strong chance your Windows 10 computer will run Windows 11 just fine. Do we recommend it? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705148/windows-11-upgrade-beta-release-preview-impressions"&gt;Not necessarily&lt;/a&gt;, but this article might help you figure out whether your PC is ready for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVF2jQ"&gt;Here’s a basic checklist of what you’ll likely need, and how you might satisfy each requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SxPe7Y"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Basic system requirements&lt;/a&gt;: 1GHz dual-core CPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, UEFI motherboard, TPM 2.0, DX12 graphics, 720p display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yhe225"&gt;UEFI must be enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1yRTmS"&gt;TPM must be enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lWA1Kb"&gt;Secure Boot must be enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ck1udY"&gt;Processor must be on Microsoft’s approved list if you want an in-place upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4UMd0W"&gt;64GB of free space if you want to dual-boot Windows 11 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="AxWX2C"&gt;Before we go any further, why not give Microsoft’s official PC Health Check tool a try? (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;Direct download here&lt;/a&gt;.) If you pass, you’re probably already fine. Just wait for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708478/microsoft-windows-11-upgrade-free-os-how-to-download"&gt;the official Windows Update&lt;/a&gt; and you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VR16st"&gt;But if not, your first steps should probably be to turn on your TPM and Secure Boot setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gbnrAM"&gt;How to turn on TPM &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdzwVU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;As we discussed in June&lt;/a&gt;, you probably already have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in your PC, built into your desktop or laptop motherboard or your CPU. (If you don’t, there are &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/bypass-windows-11-tpm-requirement"&gt;hacky ways around it&lt;/a&gt;, but let’s start by saying you do.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHvrC4"&gt;It’s possible that Windows will see your TPM, and you can easily check by either running that aforementioned PC Health Check tool or hitting &lt;strong&gt;Win + R&lt;/strong&gt;, typing &lt;strong&gt;tpm.msc&lt;/strong&gt; into the window that appears, and hitting &lt;strong&gt;enter&lt;/strong&gt; to see what kind of TPM might be there and if it’s “ready for use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBWccK"&gt;If it’s not, don’t give up yet! It might just be disabled in your BIOS and you’ll need to go hunting for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6tDdN0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10788546"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ErByTU"&gt;Once you’re in the BIOS, the TPM setting goes by a wide variety of names. (My desktop motherboard called it “Intel PTT” (Platform Trust Technology), but it might be an “AMD PSP fTPM” or simply a “Security Device.”) If you don’t see an obvious place to check, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-tpm-2-0-on-your-pc-1fd5a332-360d-4f46-a1e7-ae6b0c90645c"&gt;Microsoft suggests&lt;/a&gt; looking for a sub-menu called “Advanced,” “Security,” or “Trusted Computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1Uuzr"&gt;Oh, and depending on your BIOS, you may need to use your keyboard’s arrow keys to move and possibly even the PG UP / PG DOWN buttons to turn things on and off again. (Apologies if you know this, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z"&gt;it’s no longer safe to assume&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVfylh"&gt;Got it? Great! But don’t leave the BIOS just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZPzRx"&gt;If you only have a TPM 1.2 module, not TPM 2.0, you still aren’t out of luck: Microsoft will let you modify a registry key in Windows to allow upgrades “if you acknowledge and understand the risks.” If so, hit &lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt;, type &lt;strong&gt;regedit&lt;/strong&gt;, search for “&lt;strong&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup”&lt;/strong&gt; find the &lt;strong&gt;AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU&lt;/strong&gt; key, and set its value to &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sn3iJ2"&gt;How to turn on Secure Boot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="k5kxCB"&gt;Once you’re in your motherboard’s BIOS, you should likely also be able to locate a sub-menu for Secure Boot. It might be buried in a “Security,” “Boot,” or “Authentication” tab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYqRLS"&gt;Flick it to “Enabled,” if it isn’t already. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZTGnAC2_3MreCK-C35cBW0a2ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900233/secure_boot_uefi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secure Boot is easy to find in a modern Dell laptop’s UEFI, less so with a random desktop motherboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ec2SZn"&gt;If you’d like to check whether Secure Boot is already enabled from Windows (perhaps saving yourself a trip to the BIOS), there are a couple of ways to do that, too: in addition to Microsoft’s PC Health Check tool (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;direct download&lt;/a&gt;), you can hit &lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt; and type in &lt;strong&gt;System Information&lt;/strong&gt;, and launch that app to see a variety of things, including Secure Boot toggle status and your current BIOS mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ktB4Y7"&gt;I can’t turn on Secure Boot, and I’m not sure I have UEFI at all. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UCv3nr"&gt;Unless your PC is very old, you probably have the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; of a UEFI BIOS, but you might not actually be using it right now. You might be on a “legacy” BIOS that uses MBR (Master Boot Record)-partitioned drives instead of the modern GPT (GUID Partition Table) standard that Windows requires for UEFI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trsA7X"&gt;If that sounded like a load of alphabet soup, you may want to stop here! &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt"&gt;Microsoft does have an MBR to GPT conversion tool&lt;/a&gt;, but messing with partition tables fundamentally puts the data on your drive at risk. That tool didn’t work for one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer, who went on to use a different method that wound up wiping his entire partition. (Sorry, Cam!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuZiwf"&gt;If you don’t care about your data, you might as well do a clean install of Windows 11. And if you DO care about that data, why not try out a dual-boot of Windows 11 instead? Besides, those may be your only easy options if your CPU is too old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgZS0-DPfpISCUaa_A6vvlq4C9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900459/windows_11_windows_11_cpu_not_supported.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7YywH3"&gt;“The processor isn’t supported for this version of Windows.” Help!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NFVzua"&gt;While there are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; hacky ways to get around Microsoft’s restrictions — one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705148/windows-11-upgrade-beta-release-preview-impressions"&gt;tricked the Windows 11 updater&lt;/a&gt; using a Frankenstein-esque combination of old and new ISOs — the company is generally not allowing PCs with older CPUs to install Windows 11 over their existing Windows 10 operating system and keep existing settings and files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXczRD"&gt;That means you’ll generally need to create a new drive partition or overwrite an existing one, and it makes dual-boot particularly enticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL86oK"&gt;You can find Microsoft’s official lists of supported processors at these links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XDOh3r"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-intel-processors"&gt;Supported Intel CPUs for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T0eRkH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-amd-processors"&gt;Supported AMD CPUs for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HuE6fY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-qualcomm-processors"&gt;Supported Qualcomm SoCs for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GUuBYM"&gt;Generally, Intel 8th Gen or newer CPUs are supported, as are AMD Ryzen 2000 and newer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KFFaJc"&gt;How to dual boot Windows 11 or clean install the OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZyG6y"&gt;Whether you’re starting from scratch or just dipping a toe in the water with a dual-boot, the process should be roughly the same: you’ll need to free up some space, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindows11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the Windows 11 ISO or tool&lt;/a&gt;, burn it to a bootable drive, and use it to install Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NoxG2"&gt;For a dual-boot, you don’t need a second drive inside your PC — you can simply shrink your existing partition with Microsoft’s Disk Management tool. Hit &lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt;, begin typing in &lt;strong&gt;“Create and format hard disk partitions” &lt;/strong&gt;and hit enter to launch it. Make sure your drive has plenty of space, then &lt;strong&gt;right-click &lt;/strong&gt;and pick &lt;strong&gt;Shrink Volume.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll want to shrink it by at least 65,536MB (64GB) so there’s enough room for Windows 11 — I gave my laptop install 128GB (131,072MB) just to be safe. You can’t shrink more than you have, though, and you may want to leave some space for your current OS to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfR6k2P6krUtkfgvPLEkeTIIPAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900501/shrink_volume_windows.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shrink Volume option in Disk Management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I5BoFG"&gt;To actually install that ISO, all you need is a USB external drive — an 8GB USB 3.0 key should work just fine — and a piece of software to burn it to disk. Microsoft has its own Media Creation Tool which we’ll link to soon, and I’m a big fan &lt;a href="https://rufus.ie/en/"&gt;of Rufus&lt;/a&gt; to burn my bootable USB drives using downloadable ISOs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfJ5s6"&gt;Power users might want to try &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/AveYo/c74dc774a8fb81a332b5d65613187b15"&gt;AveYo’s Universal MediaCreationTool&lt;/a&gt;, which may be able to download the image and bypass TPM for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oZzS"&gt;If all goes well, you’ll reboot your computer with that USB key plugged in to start the process. You may need to press a key like F12 while your system’s booting up and manually select your external drive, if it doesn’t automatically load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hrOJxC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choose wisely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oaef0p"&gt;Now, be careful to pick the right place to install Windows 11 — if you shrunk your drive to make room for a dual-boot, you’ll tell Windows to install in the unallocated space, and if you’re overwriting an existing drive for a clean install (file loss ahoy!) you’ll pick that drive instead. For a desktop with multiple drives, you may want to power off and unplug the extra ones before choosing where to install. It’s all too easy to press the wrong button and wipe out data, and we’d hate for that to happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG5ZJW"&gt;Once you’ve got a dual-boot, it’s not too hard to switch between the two operating systems. Hit the &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; key to pull up the Start menu, type &lt;strong&gt;UEFI &lt;/strong&gt;and pick &lt;strong&gt;Change advanced startup options&lt;/strong&gt;, then select &lt;strong&gt;Restart now&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you boot back into the advanced startup menu, pick &lt;strong&gt;Use another operating system&lt;/strong&gt; and it’ll present you with your choice of OS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzNam0rUjlKPWc7cKiq0isySy7k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950003/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wVf6N"&gt;Microsoft’s free Windows 11 upgrade from Windows 10 is now rolling out. Microsoft is starting to offer the free upgrade to new devices that are still shipping with Windows 10, before making the OS available to other eligible existing hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Weaa"&gt;Not every existing PC running Windows 10 will be able to upgrade to Windows 11, though. Windows 11 will require Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) support, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. That leaves millions of PCs unable to officially upgrade to Windows 11, although there will be unsupported workarounds if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WyffW3"&gt;Microsoft is also gradually rolling out Windows 11, so the free upgrade won’t be offered to all existing PCs that are officially supported just yet. All existing and eligible PCs should be offered the Windows 11 upgrade by mid-2022, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSb2Yi"&gt;Here’s how to get Windows 11 today, if you have a new PC that just shipped with Windows 10 or a device that’s allowed to upgrade to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mJBZ9N"&gt;Check that your PC is officially supported through &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11%23pchealthcheck" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s PC Health Check app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DglUmP"&gt;Back up all of your important documents, apps, and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fbhhWh"&gt;On your Windows 10 PC, head into Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y4Vfqf"&gt;Check for updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cVPP14"&gt;If the free Windows 11 upgrade is available, you’ll see an option to download and install.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Microsoft releases Windows 11 a day early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oh_M_GDMsrs0O_F09zKJB0yVRTA=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949997/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXtqQr"&gt;Windows 11 is now officially available to download. While Microsoft is launching Windows 11-powered hardware worldwide on October 5th, the company has made the OS update available early for eligible devices in New Zealand and beyond. If you’ve purchased a Windows 10 machine recently, that means you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472519"&gt;should be able to upgrade to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVF4Ei"&gt;For everyone else, the rollout of Windows 11 will be gradual. Microsoft says existing Windows 10 devices that are eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade will start to be able to upgrade today, but it will be mostly new hardware that will receive the upgrade immediately. Microsoft says, “We expect all eligible Windows 10 devices to be offered the upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0oxJn"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472519"&gt;check to see if the Windows 11 upgrade is available&lt;/a&gt; in the Windows Update section in the Windows 10 settings area, or you may even be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22447994"&gt;skip the queue and upgrade immediately&lt;/a&gt; using Microsoft’s new Installation Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UIIqFd"&gt;New Surface devices will start shipping on October 5th with Windows 11 preinstalled, alongside new PCs and laptops from Asus, Lenovo, and HP. Other PC makers like Acer, Dell, and Samsung will also be releasing new Windows 11 devices soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s new OS is a work in progress&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LbcOgr"&gt;Microsoft wants Windows 11 to feel familiar. While the company has attempted drastic changes to the user interface of Windows in the past and failed, Windows 11 feels like a subtle and considered attempt to modernize an operating system that’s existed for more than 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kWUb4"&gt;There’s a new Start menu that ditches the Live Tiles that were originally introduced in Windows 8. There’s a new design that introduces rounded corners in place of Windows 10’s sharp angles, and some depth and color to Windows. And there’s a new Windows app store that’s far more open, with more of the apps you actually use on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmMOdL"&gt;These changes alone make Windows 11 look different, but once you get used to them it’s certainly the same feel of Windows underneath. Windows 11 is a refreshing approach to this old and familiar home, but it often feels like the home renovation phase isn’t finished. Some features you might be familiar with are missing, others that were promised haven’t arrived just yet, and there’s still too much of the crusty old parts of Windows hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vF8OOi"&gt;Whether you even upgrade to Windows 11 will also depend heavily on your PC hardware. While Microsoft encouraged everyone to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, only those with modern processors (Intel 8th Gen, launched in 2017, or newer) will be offered the free upgrade to Windows 11. It’s this decision, one that Microsoft puts down to security, that has marred Windows 11 in controversy before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDcmbJ"&gt;But actually using Windows 11 for the past few months hasn’t felt as controversial as I had expected. Most of Microsoft’s aesthetic improvements are much-needed, even if they could go a lot further in places. It feels very similar to Windows 10, but there are some missing parts that I think power users will miss greatly. While the improvements might be worth the upgrade for most, Windows 11 mostly delivers changes to an old formula that works rather than a new way to use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V7Q0Tn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10788897"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rwsfe3wfnriWmprDYHIAX5wempg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899815/E4dszJw.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 10 taskbar and Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BI9wak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and what’s new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PW22cp"&gt;You’ll notice the new Windows 11 design immediately if you upgrade. Microsoft has taken some clear cues from macOS, Chrome OS, and even Android and iOS here. Rounded corners are everywhere you look, and the centered taskbar that reveals the new Start menu feels a lot like some type of Android app launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRLuBE"&gt;Microsoft has greatly simplified the Start menu here and removed the Live Tiles of widget-like information that have existed since the Windows 8 days. It feels a lot less cluttered and easier to see your recent apps and documents. I like this simplification a lot, and I think most people will prefer it to the Start menu that exists in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoZ7Pl"&gt;Overall, the Windows 11 user interface has been rounded, with hints of color and depth throughout. Coupled with new rounds that are less jarring, Windows 11 feels a lot more modern. A centered taskbar adds to that new feeling, and you’ll find most parts of Windows 11 feel refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCTjRV"&gt;The centered taskbar icons can be switched back to the traditional left-hand side of the screen, but you can’t undock and move the taskbar freely or pin it to the sides or top of the screen like you’ve been able to do for years in Windows. To tweak the taskbar, you’ll need to head into the new settings interface. It’s an area of Windows 11 that has been overhauled the most, and it took me a few hours to get comfortable with the changes when I first started using the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sws8lVynzJyTYQEolOSqUApQO9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899818/dMCLBYe.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Settings in Windows 11 has been greatly improved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5LoRz"&gt;It’s a lot easier to navigate settings now, with hints of color and icons that help you easily identify sections. While Microsoft has included even more settings in here, you’re still thrown into the ancient Control Panel-like interfaces from 1995 if you want to adjust things like additional mouse settings. I don’t think most people will experience these areas in Windows 11 as much as they might have in Windows 10, but it’s disappointing it’s still so easy to stumble into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgu3wF"&gt;On the taskbar, you’ll also find icons for Widgets and Microsoft Teams integration. Widgets is a new dedicated section in Windows 11 that flies out from the left-hand side of the screen. It houses the weather and news widgets that were added to the Windows 10 taskbar, but you can’t drag and drop these onto your desktop or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sse8Y4"&gt;I’ve rarely used the widgets section in Windows 11. In fact, I miss having the glanceable weather on the taskbar instead of it being hidden away in a dedicated section. I also greatly dislike that Microsoft forces you into its Edge browser if you click on links in widgets, instead of respecting your default browser in the OS. The search interface in Windows 11, which remains largely unchanged, also still forces you into Edge and Microsoft’s Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48OX1O1SsWfO2al6oRB94adlM_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899821/g0PnlSo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Widgets in Windows 11 have a dedicated section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHP_ooQwmCuY_E2KNZ3dWkBIOtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899858/lkArZH0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated notification center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJbCrvVh9CNh75ccGzKs5dnVWKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899860/2mZLIIP.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Quick Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KlIni0zDUqOy90CokJB9q5X7_is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899862/OeA8K57.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 search interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUa2vl"&gt;Windows 11 also makes it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;way more difficult to switch your default browser&lt;/a&gt;. If you miss the initial prompt and forget to check an option, you’ll have to jump through multiple settings changes to enable a third-party browser as default. It’s a change that has led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671182/mozilla-default-browser-windows-protections-firefox"&gt;Mozilla to bypass Microsoft’s protections&lt;/a&gt;, to allow Firefox users to enable it as default in just a single click. Microsoft’s browser-related changes here aren’t user-friendly at all, and I’m surprised Microsoft is shipping a new version of Windows like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCcEo8"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Teams into Windows 11. It’s designed to push the service to consumers, and it supports audio and video calling, meetings, and screen sharing. I’ve barely used it, however, simply because I don’t communicate with friends or family using Teams. I feel like this will be a lot more interesting once it’s available for businesses, but until then I think most people will be searching for ways &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686302/windows-11-microsoft-teams-chat-how-to-uninstall"&gt;to get Teams to go away in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExSaAm"&gt;Microsoft has also simplified the system tray, volume fly outs, network controls, and notification center in Windows 11. I still think Microsoft could go further to improve audio controls in Windows 11, particularly the volume indicator that’s still the same one that shipped in Windows 8. It’s another part of Windows 11 that feels unfinished. It’s also completely out of place with the rest of the UI, with sharp corners and a black theme even in light mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xaQlBTgwsZrWbTWKMgI2AbW6zfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899823/u2IarC5.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows 11 taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTwi6m"&gt;Some of the best improvements in Windows 11 can be found in multitasking. Windows has long had many different ways to arrange and snap Windows, accessible through the UI, keyboard shortcuts, or context menus. Now they’re no longer a hidden secret that only power users discover. Microsoft has collected these all together and now presents them in the form of so-called Snap Assist, a button that appears when you hover over the maximize button on most apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpDe9o"&gt;It’s a great way to position apps the way you want them to appear on multiple monitors, or virtual desktops. Windows 11 will also remember these Snap layouts and present them in Snap Groups on the taskbar, making it easy to bring all your apps back together again if you’ve closed some or rebooted. Microsoft has also added an intelligent way to dock and undock laptops, where Windows 11 will remember where your apps were positioned so your apps don’t go flying around your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0g_lqe31L9jMZJJZBQzywsj39GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899827/DpGHVgC.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snap Assist feature in Windows 11 is one of the best additions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q7IMfZnDZ7kE-iAIpNsHsOdun30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899835/zeVo8j2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap Assist makes power user features easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArVppm"&gt;It’s supposed to also help when you resume from sleep and certain monitors take a while to wake up and then rearrange your apps. But again, it feels unfinished: I’ve been testing Windows 11 on a Samsung G7 monitor that exhibits this problem, and the OS still doesn’t correctly reposition my apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcdEaJ"&gt;Microsoft’s new app store is another welcome improvement in Windows 11. The Microsoft Store has sucked for years on Windows, and it barely listed any of the apps you actually wanted to install on a PC. That’s starting to change in Windows 11, thanks to Microsoft making some big alterations. Microsoft is finally allowing developers to submit any application to the store, enabling third-party browsers and regular traditional desktop apps to appear in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqhA7P2-pQgqE3QK51EsVumOCo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899840/DTzYord.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microsoft Store is greatly improved in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r9pCos"&gt;It’s a big change that has already had a big impact, with popular apps like Zoom, Discord, OBS Studio, VLC, and TeamViewer now available in the Microsoft Store. Microsoft is even opening up its Store to rival app stores like the Amazon Appstore and Epic Games Store in the coming months, and it could mean Steam will appear in the Microsoft Store soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6p0NVx"&gt;The Microsoft Store app itself also feels more simplified, with a library section that lists app updates and purchases, as well as individual sections for apps, gaming, and entertainment. Combined with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;Microsoft’s Store revenue changes&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like we’ll finally have a single location to reliably download Windows apps and avoid running into viruses by searching for .exe files on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDtc1h"&gt;Microsoft is also promoting Windows 11 as “the best Windows ever for gaming.” I’m not entirely sure why, though. In my experience playing a variety of games on Windows 11, not much has changed over Windows 10. There’s a new Auto HDR feature that’s arrived from the Xbox side, and it automatically improves compatible games where developers haven’t added HDR support. Microsoft is also adding DirectStorage support to Windows 11, the same system that’s used on Xbox to improve load times from SSDs in compatible games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWevqR"&gt;While a bunch of games support Auto HDR, DirectStorage support isn’t available at the launch of Windows 11, and it will also be available on Windows 10 once it’s ready. Microsoft is integrating its new Xbox app into Windows 11, though. It offers a better way to download and install games from Xbox Game Pass, and it even includes the ability to stream Xbox games from Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akYtHW"&gt;I haven’t noticed any big performance improvements or problems running games on Windows 11. It feels exactly the same as Windows 10 for gaming, as far as I can tell. That could change for new pre-built systems, though. &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/windows-11-pcs-can-hobble-gaming-performance/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; has noticed&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 11’s new Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) can impact gaming performance by as much as a 28 percent drop in frame rates. It’s a setting that Microsoft wants PC builders to enable by default on new Windows 11 PCs, so while it won’t impact people upgrading or clean installs, new gaming PCs could ship with VBS enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wojKi9"&gt;I wasn’t able to test with VBS enabled on my own gaming PC due to driver issues preventing the setting from being enabled. We’ve asked Microsoft about these potential performance issues, but the company was unable to comment in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eNuDizdu8B0rm7vCqr7Pp1U4_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892211/vpavic_210930_4784_0028_Edit.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touch has also been improved in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqwnLl"&gt;If you have a laptop with a touchscreen or a tablet, Windows 11 offers some improvements here, too. The touch keyboard has been greatly improved, so it’s easier to detach and move around, and it also comes with 13 new themes and a theme engine that lets you customize the keyboard with background images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zK82Q"&gt;Windows 11 also ships with new touch gestures that you can use for navigation. A three-finger gesture sideways lets you switch between apps, or you can swipe downward with three fingers to get back to your desktop. You can also use four fingers to switch between virtual desktops sideways, or swipe up to see a preview of all virtual desktops. These are identical to the touchpad gestures that exist in Windows 10, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFFF6p"&gt;Finally, Microsoft has also made a lot of improvements to the built-in apps in Windows 11. Paint, Clock, and Photos see the most changes, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631442/microsoft-windows-11-paint-redesign-update-app"&gt;Paint dropping its ribbon interface&lt;/a&gt; for a new command bar that can also be found in File Explorer. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679132/microsoft-windows-11-new-photos-app-design-features"&gt;Photos app also includes a redesign&lt;/a&gt;, with a neat multiview feature that lets you compare a bunch of photos in a single window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CnbiY"&gt;The Clock app now includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696232/focus-assist-windows-11-microsoft-how-to"&gt;Focus Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, a new feature that uses the &lt;a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique"&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt;, a method of managing time by breaking down work into smaller chunks with short breaks. Focus Sessions includes Spotify integration, and it’s useful between meetings if you want to take a brief digital detox session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDVHaLSOrik5LYzushgyE9ynkFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892222/vpavic_210930_4784_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 still feels like a work in progress in many parts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eIgTKX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s missing? A work in progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aVsjP2"&gt;Windows 11 feels like it’s still in beta in some parts, especially with missing features and promised new features set to arrive later. The taskbar is the most obvious area that’s lacking in Windows 11, with basic things missing like being able to set the taskbar size or position. Drag and drop on the taskbar is also absent, and you can’t even display the time and date on the taskbar on multiple monitors. In fact, by default, the taskbar is disabled on multiple monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ1bdt"&gt;If you’re used to enabling small icons, or ungrouping the icons on the taskbar, these features are also gone in Windows 11. You also can’t hide system icons from the system tray section of the taskbar anymore, and right-clicking on the taskbar only presents a settings shortcut instead of the Task Manager and other options that existed in Windows 10. I’ve already written how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673266/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-features-missing-design-changes"&gt;I hate the Windows 11 taskbar&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m genuinely stunned Microsoft is shipping Windows 11 like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JLn1m"&gt;While a lot of Windows 11 users won’t even notice the taskbar changes, the feedback in Microsoft’s Windows Insider program is clear. The top feedback items mostly relate to the taskbar. Microsoft is aware and tells me it’s in the process of better understanding the feedback and evaluating how some of the feedback fits into the company’s Windows 11 plans. There’s no guarantee that the taskbar will change, but I’m hopeful Microsoft will bring back some of the missing features here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sikzpD3xysMKMLnf4VD4OpBUBtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899852/7LgkMm4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark mode isn’t consistent in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Es3JT5"&gt;During my first look at Windows 11, I assumed that the dark mode would eventually get better before release. Unfortunately, it hasn’t improved. Many of the dialog prompts and parts of Windows 11 are still bright white, which is jarring when you’ve specifically enabled a dark theme in the OS. Windows is also still the only major OS that doesn’t have an automatic switch between light and dark modes based on the time of day. Android, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS all have this basic feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QR0Ypf"&gt;The new context menu system in Windows 11 is also jarring. Microsoft has created beautiful new context menus in Windows 11, but they don’t appear everywhere. You can right-click in the File Explorer and see a new context menu, but inside apps and elsewhere in Windows 11, you’ll find the old context menu regularly. They not only look different, but the options for renaming or copying files have moved so your muscle memory has to adjust accordingly. It’s hard to get used to a new method if the old method still randomly appears, though. I believe this and the dark mode inconsistencies will eventually be addressed in Windows 11, but it’s still surprising it’s not finished for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MTdLRl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10789022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzo04e"&gt;Not finished is a running theme for Windows 11, unfortunately. Microsoft had promised a universal mute and unmute feature that lets you quickly mute your microphone across all apps, but it’s missing at launch. Microsoft also announced Android apps were coming to Windows 11, but those are also not ready for launch. Even a Dynamic Refresh Rate feature that’s supposed to improve scrolling and inking on new 120Hz Windows 11 devices without hitting battery life is missing at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwgHgs"&gt;Microsoft tells me it’s working on some customer feedback around the universal mute feature and it will arrive soon. Android apps on Windows 11 should be available in preview before the end of the year, but it’s not clear when it will arrive for all Windows 11 users. Microsoft isn’t commenting on when Dynamic Refresh Rate will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jeTpCQDu2uyS5B7e_bJErJacTcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22816768/androidappswindows11.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s promised Android apps on Windows 11 aren’t ready yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f2tECk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, should you upgrade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsACxU"&gt;Whether you should upgrade will rely a lot on how you use Windows and on what hardware. Microsoft is making some dramatic changes to the minimum system requirements in Windows 11 that will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt;. Windows 11 will require Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or AMD Zen 2 CPUs and up, TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) support, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXqvYh"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t typically enforce such specific processor requirements with Windows — with both Windows 8 and Windows 10 only requiring a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM (2GB for 64-bit), and 16GB of storage (20GB for 64-bit). That’s meant that power users and IT admins have gotten used to upgrading Windows without having to worry about switching out hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brq1k9"&gt;While most consumers traditionally buy new PCs, instead of upgrading their Windows version, Microsoft’s upgrade efforts with Windows 10 have made everyone more aware of free upgrades and the security that comes with the latest and greatest. Coupled with regular Android and iOS upgrades, consumers are far more likely to be aware there’s a new version of their operating system than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aZN8Fb1klYOmzRXK9FcZ5vw1oI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899855/KAph1oD.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s PC Health Check app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPfTih"&gt;So even if you want to upgrade, you’ll need to check &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;Microsoft’s PC Health Check app&lt;/a&gt; to see if your PC will even support Windows 11. You may need to enable TPM 2.0 from your PC’s BIOS settings to get Secure Boot working, or perhaps even switch how Windows is installed on your storage if you manually installed the OS. The hardware requirements have changed a lot here, but the PC Health Check app should guide you on anything that needs addressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoQ4t3"&gt;I’ve been running Windows 11 on my laptop and I enjoy the experience there, but on my desktop with three monitors, I’m holding off on upgrading. The way I use my laptop is very different from my desktop PC, so Windows 11 fits just fine in my lap. I regularly use full-screen apps and games on my main PC, so not being able to see the time and date across multiple monitors is annoying. Coupled with the taskbar changes that prevent drag and drop, I feel less productive using Windows 11 on my main PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix0xep"&gt;While this is the first time I’m holding off on a Windows upgrade on my main PC ever, I think for most people Windows 11 will be a welcome improvement to a user interface that’s really needed some love and attention over the years. It’s not a necessary upgrade for anyone, though. I can’t point to a single feature in Windows 11 that’s really worth upgrading instantly for; instead, it’s a collection of changes that make the OS feel more modern and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XISnLO"&gt;I wouldn’t rush out to upgrade to Windows 11, but I also wouldn’t avoid it. After all, Windows 11 still feels familiar and underneath all the UI changes, it’s the same Windows we’ve had for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, Is It Down, and tons of other sites are struggling due to the Facebook outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufVdtjvxagzzrODMeyYf-yQ1-Pg=/315x0:1728x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949303/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.06.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOH1L8"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;something like Facebook drops off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, there are massive knock-on effects. For example, a website that’s meant to tell you if services are down, called Is It Down Right Now, is struggling mightily under the load of people trying to see Instagram’s status. Cloudflare, a company that runs a DNS service (DNS acts like a map for your web browser when it’s trying to find a website and is also the likely culprit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;when it comes to major outages&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?s=20"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s had to mobilize extra resources to keep up with the traffic of people trying to load Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp) over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpJzYZ"&gt;If you need to check if other sites are down, you do still have options. There’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;the venerable DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com"&gt;Down for Everyone or Just Me&lt;/a&gt; (DFEOJM informed me that it’s not just me having issues with Is It Down). I’m going to need all of you to decide between yourselves how to split up traffic between these two sites, so we don’t crash them too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZ91u_y2HjJ9H1v0YamzWdO_0Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900268/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.11.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a little awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="opQCm8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now, here's the fun part. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; runs a free DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1, and lots of people use it. So Facebook etc. are down... guess what happens? People keep retrying. Software keeps retrying. We get hit by a massive flood of DNS traffic asking for &lt;a href="https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6"&gt;https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDItZX"&gt;Of course, with Facebook down, we all needed something to do with our time. Twitter’s official account (as well as Jack Dorsey himself) was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"&gt;happy to poke fun at the situation&lt;/a&gt;, but every site has its limit. As a result, Twitter is breaking for some users too. The company’s status page &lt;a href="https://api.twitterstat.us/incidents/8tvtkby1svkv"&gt;says it had an issue with its API&lt;/a&gt;, which has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVoVsBAqXvyYMCvMgwr4fbt9QoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900720/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_12.49.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graph: DownDetector&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well NOW what do I do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wiY7iP"&gt;In the hacking world, there’s something called a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, where attackers basically pool together tons of computing resources and use them to generate tons of traffic to a website. If they’ve got enough power, the website will go down — and that’s very likely what’s happened with Is It Down Right Now, except instead of malicious hackers, it’s half the internet accidentally overwhelming the service through sheer combined will. I guess that’s what happens when &lt;a href="https://status.fb.com"&gt;Facebook’s status page&lt;/a&gt; goes down along with the rest of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="26rWHQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When Facebook goes down, an economy goes with it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A3SNbY"&gt;PS: there’s one funny side effect that comes from many people basically only using their internet connections for Facebook — many ISPs and cellular providers, like &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and more, have also been reported as down, even though their services seem to be working fine. But because people can’t access Facebook, they may assume the problem is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXUsUx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:56PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about Twitter also experiencing problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is down, along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0Qx5icf91JlXCq-1SEPtG9q6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948694/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s entire network of services suddenly went offline. The outage started just before noon ET, and nearly four hours later there’s no sign or restoration, and no one from the company has offered an explanation of the issues or estimates for when they will be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXykPn"&gt;Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.” While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over last night’s whistleblower report, there isn’t any information yet to suggest anything malicious is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem also appears to be affecting its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users can load games they already have installed and the browser works, but social features or installing new games does not. The outage is thorough enough that it’s affecting Workplace from Facebook customers and, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1445058298034614278?s=21"&gt;according to Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s internal sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9s get new look and features in OxygenOS 12 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Igjpap2aW3dgzQiRZWP61guC9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949662/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZspA1"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;OnePlus is a sub-brand of the Oppo family&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies not only merged their R&amp;amp;D departments in early 2021, but they are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;consolidating code for their two Android-based operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. While OxygenOS 12 will be used on global OnePlus phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;ColorOS 12 will only be on China-only&lt;/a&gt; Oppo and OnePlus phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2pODX"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;Android 12 to AOSP today&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus is releasing the first open beta of OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro now, while those with older models will have to wait for a later update. Once this version is deemed stable, it is likely a full version will be released within a month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;according to XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="i3mUnD"&gt;The new and improved OxygenOS 12 is colorful and minimalist like “&lt;a href="https://jamesturrell.com/"&gt;James Turrell’s&lt;/a&gt; Light and Space artwork,” as explained &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-oneplus-9-series.1502946/"&gt;in its forum post&lt;/a&gt; announcing this release. OxygenOS 12 shares some of the same design languages as ColorOS 12 and Android 12 by extension. All three OSes make liberal use of white space, as well as large sans-serif typography to “enhance readability and ease of use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoGgdw"&gt;OxygenOS 12 also follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, where the new icons use simple lines, and new widgets use shapes to make information and actions more clear and accessible to a diverse group of users. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679087/oppo-oneplus-coloros-12-update-announced-release-date"&gt;ColorOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus software is enhanced with more shadows and subtle gradients to give OxygenOS 12 a more premium look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QM3BN5-sJCAvznQ-UQDo0IcSwac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900111/darkmodes_3up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OxygenOS 12 offers three levels of Dark Mode to give you more control over your phone’s UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="orGxgt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hviAhT"&gt;In addition to its new look, OxgyenOS 12 also learned some new tricks to improve your experience with OnePlus phones. If you’ve been playing with the developer preview of Android 12 on the OnePlus 9 series, you’ll be happy to know these features have made it into the open beta of OxygenOS 12:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t5RKxn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature isolates sensitive files to a secured part of your phone, where you can safely store and protect specific photos, videos, audios, and documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yprYw6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated OnePlus Shelf &amp;amp; OnePlus Scout&lt;/strong&gt;: The handy Shelf has been enhanced with even more widgets: from notes, step counting, weather, to the calculator, according to &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp-2-oneplus-9-pro-oxygenos/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even search for anything on your phone using OnePlus Scout, which is now part of the Shelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WDehnM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Zen Mode &amp;amp; World Life Balance 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt; First popularized by OnePlus’ Indian users, both modes help you manage work-life balance by separating your personal and work accounts. You can set up different profiles with different Wi-Fi networks, with different app notifications and messages depending on the time of day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1EPmDl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dark Mode:&lt;/strong&gt; This lets you choose between three levels of dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WlFY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note app: &lt;/strong&gt;This updated app now lets you doodle as well as type out your thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9dG93J"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Canvas AOD 2.0: &lt;/strong&gt;The app lets that you create a wireframe image on your lockscreen, based on your wallpaper, is back with more functionality. It now includes more brushes and lines for you to use, as well as more photos and effects available to support your artistic vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="dY7zR8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10789206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nDAAI"&gt;It’s possible that this is the end of the road for OxygenOS, as the two companies could more fully integrate their software into one, rather than maintain two OSes. If that’s the case, OnePlus will hopefully be able to bring some of its most popular features like the Canvas AOD 2.0 and Work Life Balance 2.0 mode to future ColorOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTi9w"&gt;If you have a OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro and want to try out this open beta of OxygenOS 12, then head to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fsupport%2Fsoftwareupgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F4%2F22704578%2Foneplus-9-pro-oxygen-os-12-color-os-android-12-skin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus’ Updates and Downloads page&lt;/a&gt; to download it onto your computer, and follow the instructions to install the software onto your OnePlus phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exposure to extreme heat grew drastically in the world’s cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Severe Heatwave In Delhi NCR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u0Usiyk3tccsRKUZgpSIkI2QkPQ=/102x0:4968x3244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949670/1233737617.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People resting in a lawn on a hot summer day, at Rajpath near Vijay Chowk, on June 30, 2021 in New Delhi, India. As the monsoon continued to play truant, heatwave in Delhi NCR turned severe recording the highest maximum temperature of the season at 43.5 degree Celsius. | Photo by Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nA3D2X"&gt;Exposure to dangerous levels of heat and humidity in cities across the world has exploded over the past three decades, according to new &lt;a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/?p=93867&amp;amp;shareadraft=baba93867_614344bb0ac19"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. In a study of more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;13,000 cities, the number of people exposed to extremely hot and humid days in a given year (measured in “person-days”) tripled between 1983 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hsMLyg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extreme heat is already a leading weather-related killer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BqERQv"&gt;It’s a symptom of two trends colliding: urban population growth and rising global average temperatures. Cities often reach higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas because they’re typically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;designed in a way that traps heat&lt;/a&gt;. So when people flock to urban centers, they’re also flocking to places where they could be at greater risk of heat-related illness and death. To make matters worse,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;extreme heat is already a &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;leading&lt;/a&gt; weather-related killer, and climate change is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;exacerbating the problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kquF1K"&gt;Cities will have to find ways to stay cool in a warming world in order to better protect their residents, the authors argue. “In some cities, long-term adaptation is frankly bleak. But for much of the planet, we can use tools we already have,” says Cascade Tuholske, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and lead author of the study published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;/em&gt;“Population growth and urbanization to me is not the problem. It’s a lack of planning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sqO0r"&gt;Roughly a quarter of the world’s population lives in places&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;where exposure to extreme heat and humidity is growing, Tuholske and his colleagues found. For the study, they defined “extreme” as at least&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;30 degrees centigrade on the wet-bulb globe temperature scale. The &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/car/WBGT"&gt;wet-bulb globe scale&lt;/a&gt; is a detailed assessment of heat, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and the angle of the sun. Thirty degrees on that scale is comparable to a day that feels like 106 degrees Fahrenheit. (This isn’t a direct conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit because factors outside of temperature are taken into consideration.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHxIMl"&gt;They relied on both infrared satellite imagery and on-the-ground readings to determine weather conditions over roughly the last three decades. Using population data gathered by the European Commission and Columbia’s &lt;a href="http://www.ciesin.org/"&gt;Center for International Earth Science Information Network&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers multiplied the number of extremely hot days by the number of people in each city to get a total of “person-days”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which city-dwellers experienced those extreme conditions. The number of person-days grew from 40 billion per year in 1983 to 119 billion in 2016 — showing how many more people are now suffering through extremely hot weather in the world’s cities. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hYHGM"&gt;Rising temperatures are responsible for about a third of the global spike in exposure, the study authors sussed out. The majority of the growth in exposure has to do with more people moving to urban areas. But that ratio can vary from city to city. The boom in population growth was the main driver of heat exposure in Delhi, India. But in Kolkata, climate change was a slightly bigger factor. The differences show that solutions likely need to be tailored to fit each city. Since cities &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html"&gt;continue to attract&lt;/a&gt; new residents and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;global average temperatures continue to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rise, they’ll need to act fast.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kz8vpH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They’ll need to act fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdeBtN"&gt;Cities can reach temperatures &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands"&gt;several degrees hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding areas because of a process called the Urban Heat Island Effect. Asphalt and other dark surfaces absorb heat. Exhaust from factories and tailpipes release more heat. And there are fewer trees to give shade or plants to provide the cooling effect of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands"&gt;evapotranspiration&lt;/a&gt; (a process similar to how humans cool down by sweating). These effects tend to be worse in neighborhoods that have received less investment and more industrial activity over time, a phenomenon that other research has shown to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;disproportionately heavy tolls on communities of color&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ2Ysl"&gt;Despite the growing risk, heat-related deaths are largely preventable. To cool down, cities can paint rooftops and other surfaces white to reflect heat. Bringing more trees and greenery to neighborhoods also helps. There’s also more that can be done to warn people of coming heatwaves so that they can find public cooling centers or other spots to ride out the heat with air conditioning. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/heat-check/"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; are just a couple of the major metropolitan areas around the world working to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnzalD"&gt;“For billions of people on Earth, our study is retrospective. This is their lived experience every day,” Tuholske says. “We really need to learn from them and work with people in really hot cities to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;Like clockwork, Apple announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; model at its September “California Streaming” event alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple Watch Series 7 is the latest flagship and sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios. After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can preorder them on &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt; beginning Friday, October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings, as well as Apple’s own direct links and finalized pricing for the full Series 7 range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="TraF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2wxGivMl3xRoA_Lx7GJydjaaKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900348/Apple_watch_series7_availability_aluminum_10052021.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;With the impending release of the Apple Watch Series 7, you will be able to preorder your preferred configuration direct from Apple starting October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. If the Series 7 follows the same pricing convention as the Series 6, you should be able to outfit the 41mm version with a cellular connection for $100 more. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model will most likely run $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. We will confirm these Series 7 prices and update as soon as Apple announces pricing beyond the starting $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA will also offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan you might already have for your phone. We anticipate Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all offering the Series 7 in each of its colors at the same starting price as Apple for its cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/applewatch/SID/https://www.att.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with Apple confirming the Series 7 is to be sold in stainless steel and titanium finishes, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches, and most people opt for the aluminum models, which offer the same functionality at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for outfitting the exact custom configuration of Apple Watch a customer chooses, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
