    <title>Congress isn’t satisfied with Facebook’s pause on Instagram Kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Ax1zQ"&gt;Facebook announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;it would be “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on its Instagram for kids app on Monday after weeks of growing pressure from lawmakers and advocacy groups to scrap the app. But many lawmakers aren’t satisfied with the pause, calling on Facebook to stop development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgF3ij"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Democrats in the House and Senate called Facebook’s decision to halt development of the Instagram product targeted to kids under 13 as “insufficient.” Four lawmakers signed onto the statement, including Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3LcslX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwXwdj"&gt;“Facebook has completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt when it comes to protecting young people online and it must completely abandon this project,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Rfb9c"&gt;Facebook’s reversal comes on the heels of new reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;claiming that the company conducted several studies that identified the harm apps like Instagram cause when used by young people, especially teenage girls. In light of this reporting, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) called a hearing for this week in the Senate Commerce Committee to grill company executives over their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFXOwv"&gt;“Facebook’s decision to pause ‘Instagram Kids’ is a step in the right direction to ensuring a safe environment, but there is still much work to be done,” Blackburn said in a statement Monday. “Big Tech’s pattern of choosing profit over the wellbeing of young users is extremely concerning &amp;amp; we must hold them accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NheGag"&gt;Facebook’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms"&gt;is slated to testify&lt;/a&gt; at the hearing entitled “Protecting Kids Online: Facebook, Instagram, and Mental Health Harms” on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvzgZZ"&gt;For now, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;will continue speaking&lt;/a&gt; with parents and safety groups before moving forward on Instagram for kids. But it’s unclear how long the announced “pause” on development will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord will now let you set a unique avatar in each of the servers where you hang out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1q-vM47_ZGVIqqq5cK2gT-gebws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915602/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Discord will let you have unique avatars across different servers | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWroiH"&gt;Messaging app Discord announced today that its premium Nitro tier will now allow subscribers to use a different avatar on each of their servers. The option to “change nickname” in the app has been changed to “edit server profile.” That’s where you’ll be able to change both your nickname and server avatar, so if you use multiple servers — as a lot of Discord users do — you can keep each identity separate and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zepfMG"&gt;Discord also announced today that they’re starting the rollout of scheduled events, which allow users to plan ahead, giving time to spread awareness and join. The company says it’s seeing more communities use stage channels to connect with members, in AMAs, open mic events, or other large-scale discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2yLkm"&gt;With scheduled events in Discord, users can create an event with a topic name for a future date, allow members to RSVP — which will then send them a notification when the event starts — and create an invite link for a specific event. Members will also be able to browse a list of future events on a server. The scheduled events feature will be available on desktop, iOS, and Android, and there are no time restrictions on how far ahead of time moderators and admins can schedule events, but there will be a limit of 100 total events at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ym1OC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford recalls Mustang Mach-Es over risk of glass roof flying off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVTrD3NuyU6FkAOB3knodaGPlZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915483/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l80R44"&gt;Ford is recalling the Mustang Mach-E out of concern that the windshield and panoramic roof could leak or, worse, come flying off during a crash or while driving. Nearly 18,000 of the electric SUVs sold to date are at risk of the former, though Ford says only around 13,000 of them run the risk of the roof detaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjAEyo"&gt;The company will start providing owners with recall instructions in late October, and it says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Ford initially started recalling Mustang Mach-E SUVs last week in Canada, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5svfw"&gt;Ford told the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/FORD/MUSTANG%252520MACH-E/SUV/AWD#recalls"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it had become aware that the windshield and panoramic roof of the Mustang Mach-E may not be properly bonded to the car. The company said it does not yet know the cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4QVES"&gt;The recall is just the latest hiccup in the rollout of the Mustang Mach-E, which is the Detroit automaker’s first mass-market electric car. Ford recalled dozens of the first Mach-Es sold in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;after discovering loose subframe bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the first deliveries were delayed, too, while the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;tightened up its quality checks&lt;/a&gt;. Some early vehicles were also plagued by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;software problem that led to the 12-volt battery dying&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiKktf"&gt;Panoramic glass roofs have become a popular feature in new electric vehicles, especially after Tesla started making them standard on its cars. Tesla is familiar with the problem Ford is running into now, too, as the company dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502379/tesla-modely-roof-flies-off-convertible-quality-issue"&gt;glass roof problems&lt;/a&gt; with the Model Y SUV, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/second-tesla-model-y-owner-reports-roof-issue-glass-adhesion-2020-10"&gt;one that literally blew off on the highway&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Ford’s head of electric vehicles even took an indirect shot at Tesla after this happened, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it has passed 1 billion users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFyWKyxAQEu4YpAXcP-ZNZdKxz8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915415/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok has passed 1 billion users | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUsfUE"&gt;TikTok said Monday it has passed 1 billion monthly users. It’s a remarkable number for a platform launched in August 2018 that has been scrutinized by governments — including the US — that are worried about the data collection practices of its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srkr7J"&gt;TikTok’s popularity soared during the pandemic, becoming the most-downloaded app in the world in the first quarter of 2020, with some &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/05/20/inside-the-hunt-for-tiktoks-new-ceo-and-whats-next-for-the-worlds-hottest-app"&gt;315 million downloads&lt;/a&gt; in that quarter alone according to app analytics company SensorTower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IqY9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/chinas-bytedance-tiktok-owner-saw-revenue-surge-111percent-in-2020.html"&gt;ByteDance reportedly saw its 2020 revenue&lt;/a&gt; more than double from the year prior, to $34.3 billion. From its launch to date, SensorTower says TikTok installs have reached 3.2 billion, which includes information from Douyin, the Chinese version of the app. TikTok’s monthly average users in August were up 25 percent from August 2020. In June of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/36Kr-KrASIA/TikTok-creator-ByteDance-hits-425bn-valuation-on-gray-market"&gt;ByteDance was valued&lt;/a&gt; at $425 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUNdUe"&gt;And other apps, seeking to duplicate TikTok’s enormous success, created short-form video products of their own. Facebook-owned &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/76ed0392-a59c-4e20-adeb-2d1e87983ddd"&gt;Instagram launched Reels&lt;/a&gt; last August; Snapchat introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;in-app TikTok clone Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; in November, and even video behemoth YouTube got into the short-form game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;debuting its YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt; in the US earlier this year. But TikTok continued growing; a report earlier this month found &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660516/tiktok-average-watch-time-youtube-us-android-app-annie"&gt;TikTok users spend more&lt;/a&gt; time watching its content than YouTube users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WHrjy"&gt;On Monday, TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas thanked users in a video on TikTok for “making TikTok a truly special place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CmdukK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7012606652008402182" data-video-id="7012606652008402182" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;✨ 1 billion✨ people on TikTok! Thank you to our global community  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7012606465961757445"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYSDN3"&gt;ByteDance reportedly postponed its plans for an initial public offering indefinitely amid a crackdown on tech firms by Chinese regulators over the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;past few months&lt;/a&gt;. China is scrutinizing what it considers anti-competitive practices from its big tech firms and how the firms handle customers’ sensitive data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO1KeK"&gt;ByteDance and TikTok were among the Chinese tech firms targeted by the Trump administration last year via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; blocking their apps from US app stores. None of the orders ever took effect, and in June, President Joe Biden signed an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoking the Trump-era bans&lt;/a&gt;. Biden directed the commerce secretary to investigate apps with ties to foreign adversaries like China, that may collect sensitive data from US consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDHibO"&gt;But TikTok also saw some novel bright spots during the pandemic, not the least of which was the fan-made, crowdsourced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; TikTok musical&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a one-off bit based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film that Broadway fans, composers, choreographers, and others added to, one TikTok at a time. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; debuted as a one-night-only streaming concert on January 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210416/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-1-million-actors-fund-disney-pixar-broadway"&gt;raising more than $1 million&lt;/a&gt; for The Actors Fund, which supports performers and workers in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s5h3C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 27th 12:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The first name of TikTok’s COO is Vanessa, not Veronica. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is negotiating with music publishers after settling a copyright lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5JP4nKmdv8WxuS1qUVx2lZ7iI0=/43x0:1663x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915389/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WHnD8"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has settled a lawsuit with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and is negotiating potential deals with individual music publishers. Roblox announced the news this morning, saying it was “committed to partnering with the music industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6B6tS"&gt;The NMPA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued Roblox in June&lt;/a&gt; for letting users upload copyrighted songs into its shared library of game-building assets. Roblox quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;signed individual deals with BMG and Sony&lt;/a&gt;, but the new agreement settles all claims involving NMPA members. According to a press release and the NMPA, Roblox and the organization have agreed to the terms of an industry-wide settlement that individual music publishers can decide whether to opt in to, and the agreement also “opens a negotiation period for members to engage individually in new go-forward licensing deals” with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nEKGN4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roblox announced new ‘listening parties’ last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9nzws"&gt;Music is a major element of Roblox. The platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;hosted concerts&lt;/a&gt; by artists like Lil Nas X, and &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/09/roblox-launches-listening-parties-new-way-release-music/"&gt;last week, it launched&lt;/a&gt; “listening parties” where artists premiere an album by streaming it across a variety of individual Roblox worlds. But the NMPA accused Roblox of deliberately overlooking or obscuring the range of pirated music on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW0XmR"&gt;Roblox has yet to sign broad-ranging deals that cover users legally adding songs to their experiences — something platforms like YouTube have done — although it offers access to some tracks through &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000927163-Using-Licensed-Music-on-Roblox"&gt;a licensing agreement&lt;/a&gt; with APM Music. While this settlement news doesn’t explicitly discuss those kinds of deals, it seemingly opens the door to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVmpgS"&gt;“Roblox will work closely with the global music publishing industry to help them unlock new ways for music to be more meaningfully integrated into the global Roblox community of more than 48 million daily active users. The deal paves the way for innovative partnerships between Roblox and publishers that will offer songwriters new ways to monetize their songs and catalogues,” a press release says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yA70h8"&gt;This settlement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686404/twitch-national-music-publishers-association-nmpa-agreement-music"&gt;separate NMPA agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Amazon-owned broadcast platform Twitch. That deal was similarly open-ended, but it included an explicit change to how Twitch handles copyright violations, something Roblox and the NMPA’s announcement doesn’t mention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding Director’s Cut makes the most of the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qUguCENQb5zcHfnfTQ5PCU_EUo=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915169/51298386042_570941bddd_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UuTgs"&gt;Okay, I’ll make the obvious joke: was there really anything cut from &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;? For better and worse, Hideo Kojima’s deeply indulgent post-apocalyptic delivery simulator did not feel like it had been subject to heavy editing. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/12/22573731/death-stranding-directors-cut-hideo-kojima-missions-name-debate"&gt;Kojima himself has said&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t like the name of this new PlayStation 5 version of the game, dubbed a “director’s cut,” arguing instead that it has simply had new content produced for it. So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQBEUp"&gt;In any case, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more worthwhile PS5 upgrades out there. For $10 (if you own the PS4 release), this new edition comes with extra missions, improved visuals and performance, more tools and items, DualSense-powered haptic feedback, and 3D audio support. It all adds up to one of the better showcases of the PS5’s hardware we’ve seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XDkOPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Death Stranding is so good that it shouldn’t have a sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953031/death-stranding-hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-sequel"},{"title":"Death Stranding is a long, bizarre journey that’s both breathtaking and boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JXZwBN"&gt;Already a beautiful game on the PS4, Kojima Productions didn’t have to do a whole lot in order to make &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; seem at home on the PS5. The technical upgrades are largely related to resolution and performance: there’s a 4K quality mode and a slightly less sharp 60fps performance mode, though the former usually sticks to 60fps, and the latter is still fairly high resolution. I normally play games in their performance modes, but a quality mode that doesn’t limit you to 30fps is very welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3jeMm"&gt;Another notable addition is the ability to play the game in an ultrawide aspect ratio. This gives you a wider field of view at the expense of screen real estate — you have black bars on the top and the bottom of your screen, but you can see more of your character’s surroundings. It’s a great fit for &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;’s sweeping vistas. On my 55-inch TV, though, the picture does feel a little small at couch distance. I think the mode would work better on a bigger set — especially if it’s OLED, where the black bars will be less distracting — or for anyone using a smaller TV like the 48-inch LG CX as a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9IW6y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EV53lnCzP1w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v8VBqk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; was the first game I thought of when Sony announced the PS5’s DualSense controller, which has triggers that can provide variable levels of resistance. In &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, you spend a lot of time carrying heavy cargo on your back and using the trigger buttons to balance the load. With the DualSense, the weight is reflected in how difficult it is to pull the trigger, giving you a better indication of when you might end up overexerting yourself and tumbling down a mountain. The increased precision of the haptic feedback also helps convey the feeling of the ground underfoot, as well as weather conditions like rain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; is still the best DualSense demo&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is almost as impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nzFP2"&gt;This release also includes one of the best implementations of 3D audio I’ve heard to date. I’ve found the feature to be a little underwhelming on most PS5 games so far, for all that Sony has touted the console’s Tempest sound engine. But in &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, it really adds to the immersion. Characters speaking in cutscenes sound like they’re accurately placed around you, and you can hear where ghostly enemies are trying to stalk you from. It’s definitely worth playing this one with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGirKB"&gt;The extra content appears to be quite slight, though I haven’t been able to play through the entire game a second time yet. Many of the additions are typically quirky, from a full-on racing mode to a catapult that lets you launch heavy cargo across the scenery, while there are some more fundamental tweaks like new melee combat moves. I don’t think any of this will change anyone’s mind about the game, but there’s enough new here to make a replay feel fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrnwmM"&gt;A free 60fps patch as seen in games like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; would have been appreciated, but I think the $10 upgrade is worth it for any PS5 owner who enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; on the PS4. At $49.99 for new players, it’s also a reasonable time to get on board with a game that is truly unlike anything else. &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding &lt;/em&gt;certainly isn’t for everyone, and that remains the case here, but with this version, you’re getting a very well-rounded package that makes the most of its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uxb3Iu4Roc_XfuSzDgKvHKXKOfc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915003/akramer_201113_4290_0007.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MA1IXp"&gt;The MacBook Pro remains Apple’s top-end option for notebooks with speedy M1 processors. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags"&gt;talks of new models with a rumored M1X update&lt;/a&gt;, but as of now, if you’re looking for the best the M1 has to offer in the shape of a laptop, it’s the late-2020 MacBook Pro. Today, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1753149462504113622#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,150 with 256GB of storage or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,350 for 512GB&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second-best price of all time on the popular laptop from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw6COf"&gt;We often offer praise for its MacBook Air counterpart, which goes on sale more often and is still &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $850&lt;/a&gt;, but the MacBook Pro is a great upgrade for those seeking a bit more performance with a better, brighter screen. You also get the touchbar with the Pro model, a polarizing feature for some, but while it has that holdover from prior generation Intel-based Macs, we’re thankfully well past the butterfly keyboard era — plus it has a proper Escape key. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zPbxfO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Where are Apple’s new Macs? Here’s what we’re still expecting Apple to announce this year   ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="HlfqJn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5swWS8"&gt;In the world of Chromebooks, there are many low-cost options but nothing quite like the Lenovo Chromebook Duet. It’s hands-down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite budget pick in the entire Chromebook world&lt;/a&gt; for its value proposition, and it somehow got even better with a new all-time low price of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1753150478798220762#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This edges out the previous historical low by an additional $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HjFd2"&gt;The Chromebook Duet offers an incredible amount of capability if you want a small machine for light productivity on the go or around the house, and if you appreciate a detachable keyboard form factor. Its replacement, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chromebook Duet 5&lt;/a&gt;, is due out next month. However, with a higher starting price of $430, it will not be seeing sales this good for a long time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UrQQz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3T26M4"&gt;Did you just get a new iPhone 13 or 13 Pro? Are you in need of some chargers, magnetic or otherwise? Amazon has a slew of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/a9f54be4?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_dcell_tlt_0_a9f54be4_dt_slot-15_39f3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; on its Deal of the Day for up to 45 percent off. Its offerings include a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-PowerWave-Compatible/dp/B097Y5PMC4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic charging pad&lt;/a&gt; akin to a MagSafe puck for $20; a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charging-PowerWave-Magnetic/dp/B094FMWPPM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic 2-in-1 charging stand&lt;/a&gt; for an iPhone 12, 13, or wireless charging AirPods for $27; and even a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-PowerCore-Delivery/dp/B083NPZYXD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10,000mAh power bank&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an 18W USB-C charger for $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrT54R"&gt;For the recent iPhone adopters out there, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Foldable-PowerPort-Included/dp/B08T67HDH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W USB-C charger&lt;/a&gt; ($12) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-PowerWave-Compatible/dp/B097Y5PMC4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt; ($20) together for less than one MagSafe puck — sans charger — from Apple. The only thing to keep in mind if you’re going this route or opting for the 2-in-1 stand is that the maximum charging output to the phone will be 7.5W and not the full 15W of Apple’s MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DoukGj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10775923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6A7Cm"&gt;Also available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/79d41d02?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_dcell_tlt_1_79d41d02_dt_slot-15_39f3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Deal of the Day&lt;/a&gt; is up to 57 percent off on the August Smart Lock Pro (third-generation). This is the slightly older model smart lock from August, which requires a plug-in Connect hub, but you can get it for a new all-time low price of $99 in either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0752V8D8D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark gray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikXmDw"&gt;One of the Smart Lock Pro’s helpful features is that it works with your existing deadbolt, minimizing the amount of work required to smarten up the entry of your home. There is also an optional keypad bundle, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0846DCVJ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $159 today&lt;/a&gt;, for access via code entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UOQAKe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10775970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R8qDIQ"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22690309/amazon-fall-hardware-event-rumors-news-announcements" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon fall hardware event about to take place&lt;/a&gt;, and with it might come a cavalcade of new products, which is why we might be seeing such good deals on products like the August Smart Lock Pro and Amazon’s own first-gen Echo Show 5. The latter is the smallest Echo Show smart display that was released in 2019 and is now available for its best price ever: just $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76526131%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals092721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bttrGt"&gt;The Echo Show 5 is perfect as a bedside alarm clock, in the kitchen, or even as a bathroom countertop music and media player — since the built-in camera can be blocked by a physical shutter. It’s a helpful little smart display that can fit just about anywhere and is quite capable, thanks to its bright touchscreen and loud speakers. There is especially a lot to like for this new low price of $45. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music’s new Wear OS app is coming to older smartwatches after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scsn2o9zrSMFeCO3evBFGBk801w=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914927/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqxiAT"&gt;YouTube Music’s Wear OS app is rolling out to a handful of older Wear OS 2 smartwatches from the likes of Fossil, Michael Kors, and Mobvoi starting this week, after previously launching exclusively on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642047/google-youtube-music-wear-os-3-app-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;Samsung’s new Wear OS 3-powered Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The app lets YouTube Music Premium subscribers download songs to compatible smartwatches and listen to music offline without needing a paired phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZEED"&gt;The new app was first detailed when Google and Samsung announced they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging their Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to create Wear OS 3, and initial reports suggested it &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;wouldn’t be coming&lt;/a&gt; to devices running the older Wear OS 2 operating system. However, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621394/spotify-wear-os-2-app-offline-playback-smartwatch"&gt;Spotify’s offline support on Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, the new YouTube Music app will now be available for a broader selection of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y3vOsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Initial reports suggested it would be exclusive to new Wear OS 3 watches&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCvHZ"&gt;The app will be downloadable from the Google Play Store on compatible devices and supports Google’s Smart Downloads feature, which automatically refreshes the songs downloaded for local playback when connected to Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx6k83"&gt;Google says the app will be available this week for Fossil and Michael Kors’ Gen 6 lineup of smartwatches, as well as Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular / LTE, and TicWatch E3. More Wear OS 2 smartwatches are getting the app later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are our favorite MagSafe-compatible cases for the iPhone 13 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nV1BJrxb8kVbO4wD84DwBb2EHpI=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914810/lcimg_d2e9ab3c_4dbb_4be2_8ce9_a0c53e9e1863.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rainbow of Apple’s own MagSafe iPhone 13 caes.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KebrqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"},{"title":"The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3z5diJ"&gt;Of course, third-party accessory makers are eager to make MagSafe products, too. Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted with its proprietary technology, even though its &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; is designed to license and control these very products. So third-party accessories like battery packs and chargers can only attach to the official MagSafe products and charge at 7.5W, rather than the 15W wireless charging standard that Apple-approved accessories can achieve. But third-party accessories tend to be cheaper in price and offer more selection than the official lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34HE13"&gt;In case you’re on the hunt for cases that will work with your official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, here are the top 10 third-party iPhone 13 cases that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric car company Polestar is going public via SPAC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zqN3UU"&gt;Polestar, the Swedish electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, is going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Polestar is the latest EV company — and futuristic transportation company — to go public via a reverse merger with a so-called “blank check” company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyT7pl"&gt;By merging with a company backed by billionaire and “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-with-more-spacs-than-anyone-11620120600"&gt;serial SPAC backer&lt;/a&gt;” Alec Gores and investment bank Guggenheim Partners, Polestar says it will have an “enterprise value” of $20 billion. The deal will also net Polestar a lot of cash: $800 million from Gores Guggenheim’s trust account and $250 million in cash from private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing “anchored by top-tier institutional investors,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQrV3U"&gt;Those other investors include “Volvo Car Group and affiliates of Geely Chairman Eric Li,” and actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio, among others, Polestar says. It is the biggest blank-check merger in the EV sector since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;Lucid Motors struck a $24-billion deal&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ktMnhq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nVf30"&gt;The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;spun out of Volvo in 2016&lt;/a&gt; as its performance sub-brand but has since recast itself as an EV-only marque. Polestar is jointly owned by Volvo and the automaker’s Chinese parent company, Geely. It’s truly an automaker with dual citizenship, with a headquarters based in Gothenburg and an assembly line in Chengdu. Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Polestar 3, an electric crossover SUV, is expected to be revealed in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r6iptg"&gt;Polestar is the latest EV company to go public by SPAC, joining others like Faraday Future, Lordstown Motors, and Lucid Motors. Polestar is distinct from those companies, though, in that it has actually sold its vehicles to customers. The company is the latest in a growing line of EV startups, autonomous vehicle companies, and automotive suppliers to go public by merging with “blank check” companies, which are publicly listed investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OARJ0O"&gt;There have been some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;noticeable flops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;Lordstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; are among the EV companies that have hit some speed bumps after going public. There is a sense that in rushing to take advantage of the SPAC boom, these startups have been left to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrAkBt"&gt;Polestar may have an easier time, though, thanks to its connections to major automakers like Volvo and Geely. The company says it delivered about 10,000 vehicles last year and expects to sell about 290,000 vehicles per year by 2025, with plans to launch three new models by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYDb21"&gt;Post-merger, the combined company will be named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Ltd. and will trade under the symbol “PSNY” on the Nasdaq stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
