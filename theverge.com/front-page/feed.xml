    <title>Zillow adds support for iOS 15’s SharePlay, so you can look at homes together from your studio apartments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02gu41lKchaj0mJQdxMrRrm9iEE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306018/FINAL_Zillow_SharePlay_Screenshot_1920x1080_122121.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxnJFo"&gt;Have you ever wanted to aimlessly scroll through Zillow and admire all the heinously expensive houses that you’ll never be able to afford thanks to the skyrocketing price of real estate — but also share that experience with a friend or loved one who isn’t able to join you in your &lt;s&gt;delusional&lt;/s&gt; aspirational browsing in real life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab3f31"&gt;Well, Zillow has debuted the solution to that dubiously common problem by adding support for Apple’s new SharePlay feature to its iPhone and iPad apps. Which, in turn, allows you to browse listings (something that Zillow — a company that appears to be completely unfamiliar with the existence of baseball — describes in its press release as “America’s favorite pastime”) over FaceTime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFNfmq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An odd use for Apple’s new FaceTime sharing feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PofEn"&gt;In Zillow’s defense, the company says that 86 percent of its users browse listings with a friend, spouse, or roommate, so making it easier to do over video conferencing does make a certain amount of sense when viewed in that light. And given that SharePlay has native API support in iOS, it can’t be too difficult to integrate support (especially for an app that doesn’t have to worry about things like authenticating streaming logins or perfectly syncing video and audio playback, like streaming apps do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5fFjk"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in Zillow is available now, although you’ll need to make sure that your device is updated to iOS 15.1 or iPadOS 15.1 or later in order to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jonUi5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSVpxq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Costco members can order the Xbox Series X right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWyYhsVrT8HRt-mMne6msm-30eU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305919/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b03dj"&gt;The Xbox Series X console has remained hard to come by, and with the holidays looming the window to get one in time is narrowing. Many retailers have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;charging for the chance&lt;/a&gt; just to buy a console via subscription-based memberships, which is a game that Costco has been playing from the beginning. The warehouse retailer has gotten its fair share of console restocks, and today it has Microsoft’s flagship console available for its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;You can order the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-additional-controller.product.100691493.html"&gt;Xbox Series X from Costco&lt;/a&gt; right now, which is only sold as a bundle with an extra controller. You need a paid Costco membership to order this, which you can get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html?redirectLogin=true"&gt;here at the retailer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of $60 per year. While some video games and accessories can be purchased online from Costco by non-members at the cost of an additional fee, consoles are for members only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z86GFW"&gt;These restocks at Costco often sell out quickly, so if you don’t manage to get it this time around be sure to prep your account for success next time by saving your billing and shipping info into your account.

    <title>Listen to these wild sounds NASA recorded from Jupiter’s moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GdAc2VaVSxecY0tKsoMmMO8F1qM=/0x34:800x567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305771/2657_Juno_Ganyede_Close_Up_800x600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A preliminary close-up image of Ganymede obtained by the JunoCam imager&lt;/strong&gt; | Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQ3O3t"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-juno-spacecraft-hears-jupiter-s-moon/"&gt;unveiled a 50-second audio clip&lt;/a&gt; from Juno’s Ganymede flyby at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting on Friday. Generated from data captured on June 7th during the spacecraft’s closest approach yet to Ganymede, the sound, similar to a robot or dial-up modem, is the latest fascinating return from the Juno mission’s years-long exploration of the Solar System’s largest gas giant and its moons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC8UCf"&gt;The audio comes from data gathered using &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/juno/science/"&gt;Juno’s Waves instrument&lt;/a&gt;, designed to measure radio and plasma waves detected in Jupiter’s magnetosphere, the bubble of charged particles that envelop the gas giant. Ganymede is Jupiter’s largest moon and the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetosphere of its own. The emissions data collected from Ganymede was shifted to an audio range to make the recording, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDRSIc"&gt;“This soundtrack is just wild enough to make you feel as if you were riding along as Juno sails past Ganymede for the first time in more than two decades,” Juno principal investigator Scott Bolden of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFHzIf"&gt;Days prior to the audio being retrieved, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-to-get-a-close-look-at-jupiters-moon-ganymede"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Juno spacecraft was going to be within 645 miles of the surface of Ganymede, the closest it has ever been to it. The flyby provided a unique opportunity to study the moon, which hadn’t seen a spacecraft approach it this closely since NASA’s Galileo probe sailed past in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZAhR0"&gt;Scientists are continuing to study the Waves data collected during the Juno flyby and attempting to decode what frequency changes present within the recording mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xZmVlI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_09R6jIo74U?rel=0&amp;amp;start=49" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKhp2"&gt;In addition to the audio track, other speakers at AGU provided updates on their latest findings of the Juno mission, including further exploration of Jupiter’s magnetosphere.  According to new findings gathered from a magnetic anomaly near Jupiter’s equator known as the Great Blue Spot, Jupiter has experienced a change in its magnetic field during the last five years, and the Great Blue Spot is slowly drifting eastward at approximately 2 inches per second, taking 350 years to make its way around the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cueLvf"&gt;The more familiar Great Red Spot, a violent anticyclone just south of the equator, drifts the opposite way at a faster pace, circling the planet every four and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s first season is a welcome holiday surprise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-piQVtJNfDyDwNDkEwcgrfR-9bw=/0x0:6029x4019/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305745/APT_106_12941_R2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A fun romp with some important MCU connections&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="efzNDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is the most unassuming of the Marvel shows on Disney Plus so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aneNg"&gt;It doesn’t have the immediate hook of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s time-bending story or &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s surreal take on sitcoms. It also stars arguably the most forgettable of all the Avengers, one who is getting a big spotlight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22561250/black-widow-marvel-endgame-thor-age-of-ultron"&gt;while other, more notable characters get movies that come years too late&lt;/a&gt;. And yet… there’s something about its blend of detective story, MCU action, and charming Christmas vibe that just works. Across its six episodes, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; manages to balance being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22796664/hawkeye-early-review-disney-plus"&gt;a superhero show that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/a&gt; with all of the complex storytelling elements that come with being part of the Marvel universe. The fact that it pulls it all off so well is something of a Christmas miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIczgC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This review contains some light spoilers for the first season of Hawkeye.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxbsSV"&gt;Despite the name, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a show just about Jeremy Renner’s take on the bow-wielding hero Clint Barton. He’s a big part of it, sure, but the story is just as much about his wannabe protégé Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld). The two are forced together after Kate dons the costume of a vigilante known as the Ronin — formerly worn by Clint — putting her in the crosshairs of some very dangerous people. Clint just wants to be left alone to spend time with his family over the holidays, while Kate, who grew up idolizing Hawkeye, couldn’t be more thrilled about being forced together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCzqet"&gt;The show’s main strength is how the two play off each other. Kate is exceedingly charming, a playful mess who is constantly in over her head, and yet usually able to talk her way out of it. Clint is the opposite: sullen, pessimistic, but prepared like Batman. The story is structured a bit like a detective story, at least at first, with the two investigating a bunch of shady people connected to the Ronin. Oh, and also, it’s Christmas in New York. This all lends the show a gritty-yet-playful vibe that suits it well, where gunfights are interrupted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811932/hawkeye-usb-arrow-dongle"&gt;quips about USB standards&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t take too long before the show intersects with the rest of the MCU — and it does so from a few different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eejNJTStJ0WMJFw7sFcNE40mgeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119996/APT_105_09351_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2hYFn7"&gt;One of the main connections was teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567297/black-widows-post-credit-scene-explained-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;at the end of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Yelena (Florence Pugh) vows to avenge her sister’s death by killing Clint. When she does show up to do just that, she’s equal parts menacing and hilarious (much like in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;), a trained-from-birth killer who is also trying to do some normal human stuff now that she’s (sort of) free. Pugh and Steinfeld have incredible chemistry — Steinfeld seems to have great chemistry with just about everyone — and it’s a lot of fun to watch them talk life and death over a pot of macaroni and cheese, discussing everything from a planned killing to Rudolph, the “super-powered reindeer.” Later on, the two can’t stop complimenting each other in the midst of a brutal fistfight, with Kate telling Yelena, “Stop making me like you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtAsd2"&gt;While Marvel fans knew that one was coming, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; big connection is much more unexpected. The big bad of season 1 is the criminal overlord Kingpin, and in this case, he’s played by Vincent D’Onofrio, who also had the role on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965518/daredevil-season-3-review-netflix-marvel-kingpin-bullseye-charlie-cox-erik-oleson"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unexpected primarily because, since the launch of Disney Plus and the new wave of MCU streaming series that came with it, the fate of the Netflix shows and characters has been a source of much debate. All I’m saying is, next time an MCU character needs some help with an investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660027/jessica-jones-season-3-review-netflix-marvel-cinematic-universe-krysten-ritter"&gt;Jessica Jones is right there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVLW0B"&gt;These kinds of crossovers are common for Marvel, and for the most part, they don’t feel too obtrusive here. (Nothing is as bad as, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577248/loki-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Jonathan Majors’ monologue at the end of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;) The reveals hit a little harder if you know what’s already happened — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22555587/black-widow-review-disney-plus-marvel"&gt;I would recommend at least watching &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; first&lt;/a&gt; — but otherwise, the background knowledge isn’t strictly necessary to understand that Kingpin is a mob mastermind, and Yelena is a charming assassin. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; balances things nicely, making it work fairly well both for the die-hards and those coming in fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mfP9eBj8RT_AJWlsvrE0BfJOgaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119998/APT_105_22899.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EZfiTE"&gt;There are maybe a few too many threads happening concurrently, though, particularly towards the end. There’s an important villain reveal; the inevitable showdown between Clint and Yelena; the debut of some much-teased superhero costumes; a pivotal moment for Echo (Alaqua Cox), &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22811806/echo-hawkeye-cast-explained-alaqua-cox"&gt;a future hero who starts out as a criminal&lt;/a&gt;; Kate’s seeming ascendance to Hawkeye-level hero; and of course, a tease for what comes next, which in this case appears to involve Clint’s wife, Laura Barton (Linda Cardellini). (Surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have the traditional MCU big reveal after the credits; instead, viewers get to watch a full-song performance from the goofy Avengers musical from the first episode.) There’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; going on — at one point in the finale, there are three pivotal fights happening concurrently — and the last episode rushes through some of them without giving much time for the heavy moments to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tKDyZX"&gt;This kind of balancing act is, of course, key to the whole Marvel machine, where every story is just one cog in a much bigger machine. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; pulls it off as well as any of its contemporaries. It works as a standalone story, a fun romp through Christmas in New York, while also weaving in multiple threads from various other Marvel stories &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; setting up at least two more. All that in just six episodes — and while rehabilitating Clint Barton into a hero you finally care about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fight climate change by eating your leftovers this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW_fOnm_eEVGohPfZv7BDxaudIs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305729/VRG_Illo_4941_Kristen_Radtke_Food_Waste.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNQgZF"&gt;In my family, there are two traditions when it comes to holiday meals: there must be way more food on the table than everyone can eat, and everyone must take home a plate of food at the end of the meal to make sure all the hard work that went into its preparation wasn’t wasted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9T7NTw"&gt;While small holiday gatherings have become the norm in my house in recent years, my mom still prepares big portions. When I asked her why, it boiled down to wanting to make sure there was enough for everyone, not just to enjoy the meal but to enjoy leftovers for as long as they wanted. That seemed perfectly reasonable to me — until I learned what a problem those leftovers are for the planet if they go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0uP2H"&gt;The holidays are a busy time for trash collectors. Americans &lt;a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/pssistanford-recycling/frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-holiday-waste-prevention"&gt;throw away&lt;/a&gt; 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, including things like plastic from old tech and gift wrap. Food waste, which accounts for 30 to 40 percent of waste entering landfills year-round, also rises sharply during the holidays. During Thanksgiving week alone, Americans throw out roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/yvette-cabrera/giving-thanks-and-wasting-less"&gt;200 million pounds&lt;/a&gt; of turkey meat, along with &lt;a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/post/impact-food-waste-during-thanksgiving"&gt;30 million pounds of gravy and 14 million pounds of dinner rolls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYgdic"&gt;All told, that wasted food takes a serious toll on the planet. When thrown-away food makes its way to landfills and rots, it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. That’s on top of the pollution released during the production of lost and wasted food — equivalent to &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fight-climate-change-by-preventing-food-waste"&gt;32.6 million cars’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of greenhouse gas emissions in the US alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6SemO"&gt;Globally, the situation is even worse. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) stated in its &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021"&gt;2021 Food Waste Index&lt;/a&gt; that if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet, accounting for a staggering 10 percent of the total. Despite its obvious impact, food waste at the retail and consumer level and loss along the supply chain typically aren’t a focus in global climate change conversations, including the recent UN climate summit in Glasgow. “People don’t see the link at all,” Liz Goodwin, director of food loss and waste at the World Resources Institute, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It was disappointing that we had COP26, and food was hardly on the agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygxQy7"&gt;That said, change is starting to happen on a smaller scale. States and local governments across the US have taken note of how food waste and climate change intertwine and are enacting pilot programs or new rules to crack down on waste. Composting programs, both municipal and independently run, are making inroads in US cities and states looking to reduce the amount of waste entering landfills and cut greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50BoVt"&gt;Chris Wood, co-president of Moonshot Compost, a Houston-based composting company, said there’s a real opportunity in attracting people to composting services. Composting companies work with households, offices, and businesses by collecting their food waste via curbside collection programs or at drop-off locations around the city. For Wood and co-president Joe Villa, an uptick in demand for their composting service came during the pandemic when residents began paying closer attention to how much food they were buying due to them spending more time at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iaKn8"&gt;Composting services give community members an opportunity to reduce their food waste, but participation in these programs is voluntary. In California, a &lt;a href="https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/organics/slcp"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; requiring residents to separate all organic material like food and yard waste from their other garbage is set to go into effect on January 1st. City and county trash services will collect the food waste and turn it into &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2021/12/20/calif-law-will-turn-banana-peels-into-renewable-energy-284450"&gt;compost or renewable biogas&lt;/a&gt;. Grocery stores, meanwhile, will be required to donate any edible food they collect to organizations like food banks, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-makes-food-waste-recycling-mandatory-ac4340dc4d0b6d74e186b22c1ef7c933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehzicv"&gt;California’s law follows a similar one in Vermont, which banned throwing out food with the trash last year, &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;said. Eventually, the Golden State could fine $10,000 to cities and counties that don’t comply with the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdpMRX"&gt;Streamlining food date labels could also reduce food waste. With no national standards around these labels and manufacturers using &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating"&gt;numerous phrases&lt;/a&gt; to indicate shelf life like best by, expires on, use by, sell by and more, consumers are often left guessing how good a piece of food is to eat by smelling it or eyeballing it. Or, not wanting to take a chance, they may choose to throw away perfectly good food if the label date has passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ielgB"&gt;“The absence of having standard, clear labels means that the consumer is forced to trust the data blindly,” Marie Spiker, a researcher and assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Consumers end up throwing away a lot of food they don’t have to, and the burden is on the consumer to do a lot of research.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km5ciD"&gt;Reducing food waste through sound policy will ultimately help us tackle climate change. If done correctly, such policies could also alleviate food insecurity. Grocery stores giving food that would otherwise be thrown out to food banks could help some of the &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/54-million-people-america-face-food-insecurity-during-pandemic-it-could-have-dire-consequences-their"&gt;54 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are food insecure get their next meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5gLdw"&gt;But individual action can also play a huge role in tackling food waste, particularly in the US, where households waste roughly &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabandoim/2020/01/26/the-shocking-amount-of-food-us-households-waste-every-year/?sh=3714c667dc8e"&gt;32 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the food they buy on average. Put another way, a family of four throws out about &lt;a href="https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/"&gt;$1,500 worth of food each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV8Iko"&gt;“One of the most powerful tools we have is just to directly decrease our own waste in our homes,” Spiker said. “It’s also really challenging to do because most of our waste is happening in this very diffuse way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCZ9B"&gt;When I started thinking about how my family and I prepare meals during the holidays, it became clear that we could be doing more to reduce food waste and that planning goes a long way. While we’re cooking our plates of sides and mac and cheese, one of the things I’ll be thinking about is how to repurpose the leftovers. I’m also asking myself if the portions we’re cooking are realistic and where we can cut back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nruMjn"&gt;In the midst of a holiday season where climate change is an urgent reality, I have an opportunity to be mindful of the waste I create and, by doing so, help those who don’t have the time or resources to think about sustainability. It’s a small step, but if enough other people take similar action, it’ll give the planet a breather at a time when that’s badly needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Google and Meta executive launches at-home COVID-19 test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4NXiefUqLnrl0Pqupx6GilY4NY=/600x0:7080x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305529/DT_Packaging_ProductSuite_C_Comp_A_Output_v001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Detect&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WVFwy"&gt;A new medical testing startup called &lt;a href="https://detect.com/our-test"&gt;Detect&lt;/a&gt; began selling at-home molecular COVID-19 tests through its website last week. The company also announced its CEO — Hugo Barra, a former executive at companies like Meta and Google who previously worked on hardware products like smartphones and virtual reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABJxLZ"&gt;The timing was sadly serendipitous — the launch coincided with a near-unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States, driven by the omicron variant. It’s nearly impossible to find an at-home test for the virus. Detect’s website shows that its tests are sold out and notes that “limited quantities” will be available at noon each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohu8Ll"&gt;“During this kind of high pressure, high tension period, where people really need these tests, we’re operating just in time — we receive inventory, we put it up for sale and literally ship it out the door,” Barra told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, customers are limited to one test per household, spokesperson Anthony Ramos said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Detect’s multi-use testing platform and one single-use test sells for $75. Additional tests are $49 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jp6dLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re operating just in time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SG3Hoe"&gt;Detect’s tests look for the virus’s genetic material, like the PCR tests that get sent to laboratories for analysis. The company joins a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;handful of other groups&lt;/a&gt; making similar at-home molecular tests. They’re different from rapid at-home antigen tests, which look for proteins on the surface of the virus (and can be less accurate than molecular tests). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CPVD1"&gt;Molecular testing is an unusual career pivot for someone like Barra, who previously worked on Android product management at Google, with Chinese cellphone maker Xiaomi, and on the virtual reality team at Facebook (now Meta). He told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he started working with Detect founder Jonathan Rothberg while he was still at Meta, which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440857/hugo-barra-leaving-facebook-ar-vr-oculus-google-xiaomi"&gt;left in May of this year&lt;/a&gt; to join Detect full-time. Barra says he was interested in taking his experiences in electronics and tech products and applying them to consumer-focused health technology. Health products often look and feel like they were designed a decade or two ago, he says, and aren’t on the same level as consumer electronic products like smartphones and virtual reality headsets in terms of their user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRDIrD"&gt;“Part of my impetus to come into the health tech world, and specifically the consumer health world, was to try and bring that sort of DNA — no pun intended — and these playbooks from the consumer electronics world,” Barra says. While Detect formed specifically to build a COVID-19 test, it aims to expand its test offerings to things like sexually transmitted infections and other respiratory illnesses, according to Barra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1Egyp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;talked with Barra about making the transition from consumer tech to health and how Detect plans to grow during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TacX70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qcgmm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect launched with the goal of testing for COVID-19. Are you planning to expand to other viruses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8qhTB"&gt;The platform we built can be reprogrammed to target any other sort of genetic target. We have plans to release home tests in a few different spaces. We’re building an STI test and a respiratory panel test that would look for things beyond just COVID. We’re also looking at a sore throat test, which would be helpful to help parents understand if their child has a sore throat from a bacteria or from a virus. And then there are others, which we aren’t quite ready to go into yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyCd0k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this type of test useful for, particularly compared with rapid antigen tests, which at this point are cheaper? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCWgpy"&gt;Rapid antigen tests and rapid molecular tests both have their place in the world, and it’s a combination of both of them used in the right way that we think really becomes powerful as a public health tool. Rapid molecular tests are ones that can see the virus earlier than rapid antigen tests. It’s the one you use when you need a really high-quality answer. It also works effectively as a confirmatory test for a rapid antigen test. Antigen tests can produce false-positive results, so if you get a positive result there, confirming it with a molecular test of any sort is generally a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKOgm0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, your tests are pretty expensive and might be cost-prohibitive for many people — especially right now, when demand is so high and people need to test frequently. Is that something you think could improve in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJqEgA"&gt;Our goal for this product is to be able to get it down to the price of a rapid antigen test. That’s what we want to be able to get to, and we think we can get there because our product is simple enough that we can make it cheaper with volume and more automation. We can definitely do that inside of 12 months and probably inside of six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cddxdz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our goal for this product is to be able to get it down to the price of a rapid antigen test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqh95E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is healthcare different than other areas you’ve worked in, and what have you learned over the past year and a half about those differences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoF91n"&gt;There are two things in particular that you really have to learn quickly if you’re going to enter the consumer health world, aside from all the science. The first is quality. In the world I come from, it’s basically quality control — you test a product and make sure it won’t fail, and there are thresholds for how often it can fail. In the healthcare world, that’s a completely different ballgame. You really have to follow a pretty strict set of guidelines of quality management to ensure you’re paying attention to every step of designing and testing a product. Quite honestly, any company in the world would benefit from that — it just leads to you making better products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4XgfY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the healthcare world, that’s a completely different ballgame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YfoLSS"&gt;The second is regulatory. We’ve built a very healthy and successful partnership with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] in the United States, and we’re in the process of building partnerships with regulators in other parts of the world. It’s a humbling experience. These people understand what we’re building better than anyone else and sometimes even better than we do because they’ve seen it across so many companies. At the end of the day, it also forces you to build a better product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eiWXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech companies are clearly more and more interested in the health space. Are there things that you’ve learned from this experience that you’d tell former colleagues at big tech companies about working in this area? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDgE0z"&gt;I probably would come back to the importance of really being humble and really not trying to do everything yourself. In Silicon Valley, and especially the big tech companies, there’s a general sense of “we can do everything” — because we have some of the best people in the world, and we have infinite investment. But that isn’t really enough. You really need to understand the landscape, you have to partner with public health systems, and you have to be humble. You have to build those partnerships from early days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhQxua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8 great shows and movies from 2021 to stream on Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hDxsiTFPUybJ9SgbXc0v3JFGdY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305490/RoundUpArt_HULU.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what to stream over the holidays&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qSe7Z4"&gt;When reuniting with loved ones for the holidays, a post-festivities, good old-fashioned movie night may be in order. But the massive libraries many of us have to choose from on our favorite streaming services can feel downright overwhelming — particularly when the whole family is weighing in on what to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW8cdk"&gt;For your kick-back holiday viewing this season, may we recommend a handful of titles from Hulu? Hulu is one of the more popular premium streaming services you can subscribe to, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715403/hulu-price-increase-2021"&gt;fairly affordable&lt;/a&gt; if you can live with ads. Basic Hulu (sans live TV) starts at $7 monthly or $13 per month to go ad-free. Between its originals, FX on Hulu, and its massive library of on-demand shows and movies, it’s a choice pick for anyone looking for a bit of variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewWx9D"&gt;This month, several anticipated titles are scheduled to hit the service. Whether you’re in the market for a sci-fi thriller or something to throw on for the whole family, we’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EBDugk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926191" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LwtcwM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MDO3Tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother/Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ot3xPz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36q2jwmte40?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SOzNbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother/Android&lt;/em&gt; stars Chloë Grace Moretz as Georgia, who, along with her boyfriend Sam (Algee Smith), must face-off against rogue androids who have revolted against their human counterparts. Georgia, who is pregnant, hatches a plan to reach safety in Boston, but the two-week journey will see Georgia and Sam going head-to-head with killer bots in order to reach their final destination before Georgia goes into labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="l1G9Cw"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hnxOwq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trolls: TrollsTopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="KDXoKu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aezf_y871pk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qB2ey8"&gt;For anyone with little ones in tow this holiday season, all-new episodes of DreamWorks’ &lt;em&gt;TrollsTopia&lt;/em&gt; arrive this month. The animated streaming series is inspired by the &lt;em&gt;Trolls&lt;/em&gt; films and will have plenty of musical fun to keep younger viewers occupied during the holiday festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8T6C4s"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3n4qr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; (Season 15)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="GJttN6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTGQiJ6sAxU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvw3MG"&gt;Everyone’s favorite clowns returned this month in season 15 of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;. Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) star in eight episodes for this record-breaking season, which cemented the show as the &lt;a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia"&gt;longest-running live-action sitcom&lt;/a&gt; in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJHW9I"&gt;New episodes of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; air Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XY7Rao"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gd7owk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ApyEWh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJF2cB4hHv4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5sXrfw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devs&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a new FX title — the limited series originally premiered last year (you can read &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171576/devs-review-silicon-valley-murder-fx-hulu"&gt;full review right here&lt;/a&gt;). But any sci-fi enthusiast who has yet to watch it would be wise to check it out. The mind-bending thriller is set on the remote campus of tech startup Amaya and follows software engineer Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno) as she seeks answers about a mysterious murder. Nick Offerman stars as Forest, the eccentric CEO of Lily’s employer and the mastermind behind a new technology that could forever alter Lily’s world as she knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vaD9q7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l9DP6L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nowhere Inn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Qq7j1H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7igJaXJreU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aIhZe"&gt;Carrie Brownstein and Annie Clark (known musically as St. Vincent) star in this mockumentary about a musician who teams with a friend to document her life as a performing artist. But when both become fixated on their ideas of which sides of Clark’s persona should be captured on film, the two find themselves navigating increasingly distressing creative landmines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4wVcJC"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qwL9iU"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pen15&lt;/em&gt; (Season 2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="SSuMat"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFAHiU0g0xQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ohWMH5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pen15&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the best choice for a family-friendly viewing affair, but the raunchy teen dramedy about teens Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine captures the hilarious if not painfully awkward experience of navigating teenaged social dynamics. New episodes of season 2 premiered on Hulu on December 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="aiihph"&gt;

    <title> T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet: I tried it, and it tried me</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is cellular good enough for a home internet connection?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZyAzmr"&gt;I was interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile’s Home Internet service&lt;/a&gt; from the first time I heard about it: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711794/t-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut"&gt;$50 (a price that includes the specialized router)&lt;/a&gt;, contract and data cap-free, and is powered by 5G and LTE instead of phone lines or cable. As many people in the US can probably relate, I’m not in love with my traditional ISP — I often push up against its 1.2TB data cap, and $80 per month feels like a lot to pay for the supposedly 400Mbps service I get. So I wondered: could I, a remote worker and heavy internet user who likes to stream video, play multiplayer games, and do cloud backups, actually be fine with internet delivered through the air instead of a cable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axXVco"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, it seems like the TL;DR answer is no; despite &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s site&lt;/a&gt; telling me my address is eligible, the router almost always had a “weak” cellular signal, and there were so many drop-outs and slowdowns that even my non-techie wife was fed up with it after a few weeks. The thing about cellular internet, though, is that my experience won’t necessarily be the same as yours, even if you live a few blocks away from me. So take this review for what it is: one person’s experience with what the service is like in one tiny, non-specific part of eastern Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdvDSP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10926344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="qZ6EeW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Five things to consider before you sign up for T-Mobile Home Internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UgddWWUxLMIYc4hj811jPDX8oI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086507/mclark_211109_4928_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s router has decent I/O, but the most interesting ports don’t work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzGp6"&gt;Before we get into the particulars of my experience, though, let’s start with what’ll be universal to those using the service: the router hardware and setup process. The router supports Wi-Fi 6, which is nice to see, and has a small circular touchscreen on top that you can use to see various statistics like how many devices are connected to your network and how good its cellular connection is. On the back, there’s a place to plug in the (frankly massive) power brick, two Ethernet ports, a power button, and a few pins that let you plug in a battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqUwQu"&gt;Looking at that picture, you may be just as excited as I was when you see that there’s a USB-C port. I have no idea why the router’s manufacturer, Nokia Solutions &amp;amp; Networks, put it there, but it and the RJ-11 phone port are currently non-functional, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fpublic-files%2Fattachments%2FT-Mobile%2520High-Speed%2520Internet%2520Gateway%2520End%2520User%2520Guide.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the router’s manual&lt;/a&gt; (pdf). Bummer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RncpqR"&gt;After you plug the router in and turn it on, it’ll prompt you to download T-Mobile’s app using a QR code displayed on its screen. I had a lot of frustrations with the app at first, until I realized that I had to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi network before hitting the “setup device” button. As far as I can tell, that step isn’t included in the quick setup guide, nor is it hinted at in the app itself. The setup process was a breeze after I figured that out, though, with the app prompting me to choose a name for my network and to set a password (the default name and password are printed on the bottom of the device if you’d rather just leave it as-is). Then, the app told me it was time to find a good spot to put the router where it could pick up a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhjayubdszaq6huIKXOa7OOgdYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086515/mclark_211213_4928_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My search for signal didn’t go great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJDoddVDl6Wp_MGWQXiyMyq7uhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086512/mclark_211211_4928_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The router’s power brick is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzQzT"&gt;That process was actually quite fun. The router has a battery in it, so you can walk around with it and test out the signal strength in different spots. (The battery doesn’t seem to work as a backup power source, though. If it’s not plugged into power, you won’t be getting any Wi-Fi.) As I mentioned before, though, this feature didn’t help me out much; upstairs or downstairs, right next to a window or in the absolute middle of my house, I got a steady two bars of service (out of five) — even taking it outside didn’t help, not that I could’ve left if there had I gotten perfect signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwBhLT"&gt;The app doesn’t make it clear if you’re using LTE or 5G, but digging into the router’s web GUI, you can see what cellular bands it’s making use of. After Googling band designations, I was able to determine that, at time of writing, the router was primarily connected to LTE and was using 5G as a secondary connection. Of course, as T-Mobile says on its site, that could change based on “signal strength and availability, time of day, and other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The T-Mobile router’s status screen, displaying that the primary signal was on the B2 band, and the secondary signal was on the n41 band." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXOiN5NyMsvNXQejGM3TfJrE1yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099655/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_12.52.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can figure out where your signal is coming from, with a bit of digging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DzCEBE"&gt;I ended up putting the router in what I felt like would be the most advantageous place: on a windowsill upstairs, facing the city. From there, all that was left to do was unplug my current access point (I didn’t want it to talk over the T-Mobile router) and plug my switch into my new cell-powered router to get all of my hardwired IoT devices connected to my new home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe8klf"&gt;At first, everything seemed all right. I was getting download speeds anywhere from 73 to 135 Mbps, and I even saw upload speeds as high as 20 Mbps. For the first day or two, I really didn’t encounter any issues — when it came to actually using the internet, it seemed to be the exact same experience as when it was coming in over the wire (and Siri could even play Apple Music on my HomePods, something that’s completely broken on my normal setup for some reason). The router also performed admirably — my laptop’s internet was just as fast in my office right next to the router as it was in my living room, which is downstairs and across the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjOamWvfftJV6BkdGJXM9u4V9lQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099744/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_13.23.48.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For $50 a month, it’s hard to complain about these results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUE454"&gt;Slowly, though, hiccups started to pile up. Webpages would occasionally struggle to load, or I’d switch channels in Slack and notice that everybody’s profile pictures were grey squares until their actual smiling faces loaded in one by one (which is how I learned that Slack doesn’t seem to cache those images, for some reason). Once, the speeds were so abysmal that it took Twitter a literal minute to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmk9Xr"&gt;There were even a few periods where the internet would seemingly just be gone for a few minutes at a time, with my web browser immediately telling me that it couldn’t connect when I tried to navigate to a site. The frequency of the outages or slowdowns varied — some days, I only had occasional glitches, and a few days, the internet was basically unusable. There weren’t a ton of perfect days, but they did happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LkVXWn1va8kEhJmH79DSZKh_jpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099757/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_21.12.27.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This result, though, is less ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2A2qC"&gt;From what I can tell, this was almost always an issue with the actual service and not the router (though there was one abnormally long outage that did appear to be a router issue, as it was fixed as soon as I rebooted the machine). I could send packets between the devices in my house just fine — I was just cut off from the outside world. I asked T-Mobile what could’ve caused these issues, and it told me that “while you might see slower speeds during times certain times of the day, due to network congestion, 30 seconds to load a webpage doesn’t sound like a normal experience.” I asked for ideas as to what may have caused it but didn’t receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTMOdT"&gt;As someone expected to be ready to jump on breaking news at any moment, this was obviously not ideal for my use case. I’m sure my boss and coworkers got annoyed with how often I said something along the lines of “okay, I’ll grab that as soon as my internet starts functioning again.” The unreliability also caused issues in my personal life, too — when trying to watch YouTube with my wife, she’d occasionally comment on the “potato resolution.” (Mind you, this is someone who is perfectly content watching DVDs.) I would also run into issues trying to play online games, with my ping swinging like a pendulum from a usable ~30ms to an unplayable 900ms. You can see the results of that in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="L5xpMU"&gt;It’s not that T-Mobile Home Internet never worked. I’d say the majority of the time, it was perfectly fine. I was able to play several hours of multiplayer &lt;em&gt;CoD&lt;/em&gt; during my testing, and for the most part, I was shocked that the experience could be as good as it was over cellular. I was also able to do some perfectly acceptable video calls with friends and family. When my service was working, I genuinely couldn’t tell the difference between it and my normal cable provider. It’s just that I couldn’t rely on it working that well, and as someone who works from home, that’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DCBcHD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10926399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvunmr"&gt;I was hoping to switch to T-Mobile’s home internet if my tests went well — I’m not the type of person who needs to have a screaming fast 200 Mbps plus connection and am even willing to put up with a little spotiness if it means not having to pay $80 a month for Comcast and its data caps. But the first time I got the notification on my computer telling me that my phone’s battery was dead because I’d been tethering to it all day, I knew those hopes had been dashed. (It would’ve been awkward if my phone ran off T-Mobile, but I’m on the Verizon-powered Visible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sNI7g6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it did feel ironic having to use cellular internet because my cellular internet wasn’t working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Buei"&gt;That doesn’t mean T-Mobile’s internet won’t work for anyone — I may have had a better experience had I been able to get more than two bars of service at my house (though the app usually showed that it still had two bars of signal during outages), and for some people, even the worst of what I experienced would be better than what they’re currently using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dPj7n"&gt;When I was using DSL a year ago, I still probably would’ve chosen T-Mobile over it — the two connections were similarly reliable, but I got faster speeds over cellular when it was working than I used to get over the phone lines. For people who live in an even more rural setting than I do and rely on the internet less, T-Mobile’s internet could be a huge upgrade from dial-up or extremely spotty satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNPrtO"&gt;Speaking of satellite internet, there’s an obvious comparison between T-Mobile’s service and SpaceX’s Starlink; both promise home internet without the need for infrastructure coming to your house. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;wasn’t pleased when he tried out the Starlink beta&lt;/a&gt;, and the service is significantly more expensive than T-Mobile’s: you have to pay $499 plus shipping for a satellite dish and $99 a month for the service. But Starlink does promise higher speeds, saying you can expect 100Mbps to 200Mbps downloads. While T-Mobile says that many users can expect “speeds in excess of 100Mbps,” it says that the average is “between 35-115 Mbps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="hUJFvh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither service excelled for us, but they could get better if they continue to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot8K5C"&gt;There are other pros and cons for each service. Installing Starlink’s satellite dish is significantly more invasive than plugging in T-Mobile’s router, and I doubt my apartment complex would ever be okay with me sticking something on the roof (even with Starlink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;new, smaller design&lt;/a&gt;). And T-Mobile’s service uses the cell towers that also provide service to our phones — Starlink &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;wants to put 12,000 satellites into orbit&lt;/a&gt; to power its service, potentially obstructing our view of the cosmos. But if your house is in an area without reliable cell service, T-Mobile obviously isn’t going to be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29L0sB"&gt;It’s conceivable that T-Mobile’s home internet could get better over time — when compared to building out traditional internet infrastructure, adding 5G capacity to cell towers requires much less physical labor. I want to break up with my ISP so badly that I may give T-Mobile another chance every year or two to see if it’s improved to the point that I could use it. The company makes that easy — it’s a no-contract service, so it’d only cost me $50 to get an entire month to give it another shot. If you live at an eligible address and are curious about cellular internet, it may be worth at least giving it a shot. You may end up having a much better experience than I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oaqmi7"&gt;For now, though, I’ll be sadly trudging back to Comcast. It seems that my dream of $50 unlimited internet was just too beautiful to come true in 2021. If you’re thinking of trying it out for yourself, be sure to read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;our list of considerations&lt;/a&gt; before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AWS logs third outage this month, affecting Slack, Epic Games Store, Asana and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcfUAN03InB_0UTKa7CYDLIq97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305351/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuvhOy"&gt;Amazon’s crucial web services business AWS is experiencing problems today, with issues affecting services like Slack, Imgur, and the Epic Games store for some users. It’s not looking good if you’re working from home, with some Slack users unable to view or upload images, and work management tool Asana also hit by the outages. As of 6:13 AM PST, Amazon said it had &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22613821%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Ddash.parsely.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;restored power&lt;/a&gt; to affected servers, but users may still experience issues going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMi62F"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12/a17eae991fdc437d"&gt;incident update&lt;/a&gt;, Slack said its services were “experiencing issues with file uploads, message editing, and other services.” Asana said the problems constituted a “&lt;a href="https://status.asana.com/incidents/xm08pc5v6mlk"&gt;major outage&lt;/a&gt;,” with “many of our users unable to access Asana.” Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1473644098632441860"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “Internet services outages” were “affecting logins, library, purchases, etc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBnzJ"&gt;It’s the third time in as many weeks that problems with AWS have had a significant effect on online services. Two incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837637/aws-west-is-down-twitch-outage-amazon"&gt;involving AWS&lt;/a&gt; ended up knocking out a huge array of platforms and products, taking out streaming sites like Netflix and Disney Plus as well as smart home devices like security cameras from Ring and Wyze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT4U31"&gt;Today’s outages seem less widespread but still notable, with some users unable to access services entirely and others merely experiencing intermittent faults. &lt;a href="http://DownDetector.com"&gt;DownDetector.com&lt;/a&gt; shows reports of issues with the platforms mentioned above, as well as news aggregator Flipboard, online learning site Udemy, dating app Grindr, streaming service Hulu, and IoT services from Honeywell, Life360, and Samsung’s SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAowQB"&gt;The official &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS service health dashboard&lt;/a&gt; blamed the issues on power outages in a single data center, affecting one Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) within the US-EAST-1 Region. At 6:13 AM PST, the company said it had restored power to the data center and was making progress recovering the affected instances. However, users will likely continue to notice the effects of these outages for a while longer while systems are updated and restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6IIXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 8:36AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story to add responses from affected services. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMzrY4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 9: 34AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story to note that AWS has restored to power to the affected data center. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: metaverse isn’t ‘compelling’ and Web3 ‘more marketing than reality’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILHVa9"&gt;The metaverse and Web3 are two trends supposedly set to revolutionize the digital world. But the richest man IRL, Elon Musk, is not keen on either. In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BaRKd4U6Ixg"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO said he couldn’t see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, and derided Web3 — a nebulous concept in which internet services are rebuilt around blockchain and cryptocurrency — as “more marketing than reality,” adding “I don’t get it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iAyTA"&gt;Musk admitted that he might just be “too old” to understand these new technologies. “Am I like one of those people who was dismissing the internet [in] ‘95 as some fad or something that’s never going to amount to anything?” he suggested, before noting that in 1995 he was very much one of the individuals who understood the potential of the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7YY3Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANMMa8"&gt;Musk’s criticism of the metaverse focused on a lack of compelling use-cases and a disappointing experience for consumers. “Sure you can put a TV on your nose. I’m not sure that makes you ‘in the metaverse,’” he said. “I don’t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day and not wanting to ever leave. That seems — no way.” He later added: “I currently am unable to see a compelling metaverse situation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qkr6xh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is the metaverse, and do I have to care?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4FdL9m"&gt;Right now, the “metaverse” is mostly an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;over-hyped branding exercise&lt;/a&gt; for a series of virtual worlds, some of which are dependent on VR headsets to access. Critics point out that we’ve basically tried all this technology before, with the failed VR boom of the ‘90s and the rise of spaces like &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;in the early 2000s. What this current iteration mainly offers is improved hardware, a flashy new title, and billions of dollars of backing from giants like Facebook-owned Meta, keen to control what they see as the next big digital platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faskVL"&gt;Web3 is another alternative vision for the future of the internet, with much boosterism driven by the idea that ordinary internet users will be able directly profit from their content and activity online (rather than having this value captured by a few behemoth internet companies). Musk didn’t spend much time discussing Web3, but he’s previously expressed skepticism about the project on Twitter, joining fellow tech CEO Jack Dorsey. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848162/jack-dorsey-web3-criticism-a16z-ownership-venture-capital-twitter"&gt;Dorsey’s criticism&lt;/a&gt; is that Web3 won’t democratize anything, but will simply shift power from existing incumbents like Facebook to upstart venture capital funds like Andreessen Horowitz.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwuDv7"&gt;Elsewhere in the interview with &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee — &lt;/em&gt;a conservative and Christian humor site — Musk discussed &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=2580"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; (“I’m not in the camp of super-alarmist global warming,” he said, but added that negative effects like rising sea levels are “not a wise risk to take”), the existence of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=3236"&gt;other life in the universe&lt;/a&gt; (“If anyone would know about evidence of aliens it would be me, and I’ve seen nothing”) and said there should be a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=3625"&gt;regulatory agency&lt;/a&gt; to oversee “advanced AI” that he thinks poses a threat to humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCjK8"&gt;In the beginning of the episode, Musk also took time to compare &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;, which he said had gotten too “politically correct” and “leftist.” (It’s worth noting that Musk used to be a &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-wanted-to-buy-the-onion-now-hes-poaching-its-staffers-for-a-secret-project"&gt;huge fan of &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but changed his mind &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1375214332028444674"&gt;when the publication made fun of him.&lt;/a&gt;) Musk said that &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; had got “the woke mind virus,” which he &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BaRKd4U6Ixg?t=670"&gt;later described&lt;/a&gt; as “arguably one of the biggest threats to modern civilization.” &lt;/p&gt;
